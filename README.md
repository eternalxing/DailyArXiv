| **[Improving Parametric Knowledge Access in Reasoning Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22193v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study reasoning for accessing world knowledge stored in a language model's parameters. For example, recalling that Canberra is Australia's capital may benefit from thinking through major cities and the concept of purpose-built capitals. While reasoning language models are trained via reinforcement learning to produce reasoning traces on tasks such as mathematics, they may not reason well for accessing their own world knowledge. We first find that models do not generate their best world knowledge reasoning by default: adding a simple "think step-by-step" cue demonstrates statistically significant improvement in knowledge recall but not math. Motivated by this, we propose training models to reason over their parametric knowledge using world-knowledge question answering as a verifiable reward. After reinforcement learning on TriviaQA (+9.9%), performance also improves on Natural Questions, HotpotQA, SimpleQA, and StrategyQA by 4.2%, 2.1%, 0.6%, and 3.0%, respectively. Reasoning models are under-optimized for parametric knowledge access, but can be easily trained to reason better.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stagewise Reinforcement Learning and the Geometry of the Regret Landscape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07524v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Singular learning theory characterizes Bayesian learning as an evolving tradeoff between accuracy and complexity, with transitions between qualitatively different solutions as sample size increases. We extend this theory to reinforcement learning, proving that the concentration of a generalized posterior over policies is governed by the local learning coefficient (LLC), an invariant of the geometry of the regret function. This theory predicts that deep reinforcement learning with SGD should proceed from simple policies with high regret to complex policies with low regret. We verify this prediction empirically in a gridworld environment exhibiting stagewise policy development: phase transitions over training manifest as "opposing staircases" where regret decreases sharply while the LLC increases.</p></details> | 48 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Provable Last-Iterate Convergence for Multi-Objective Safe LLM Alignment via Optimistic Primal-Dual](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22146v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a significant role in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While RLHF with expected reward constraints can be formulated as a primal-dual optimization problem, standard primal-dual methods only guarantee convergence with a distributional policy where the saddle-point problem is in convex-concave form. Moreover, standard primal-dual methods may exhibit instability or divergence in the last iterate under policy parameterization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF that unifies a broad class of existing alignment algorithms, including safe-RLHF, one-shot, and multi-shot based methods. Building on this framework, we introduce an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm that incorporates predictive updates for both primal and dual variables to stabilize saddle-point dynamics. We establish last-iterate convergence guarantees for the proposed method, covering both exact policy optimization in the distributional space and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose gap is related to approximation error and bias under parameterized policies. Our analysis reveals that optimism plays a crucial role in mitigating oscillations inherent to constrained alignment objectives, thereby closing a key theoretical gap between constrained RL and practical RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-Protégé: Learning to Selectively Collaborate With an Expert Unlocks Small Language Models as Software Engineering Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22124v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small language models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in cost, latency, and adaptability, but have so far lagged behind larger models on long-horizon software engineering tasks such as SWE-bench, where they suffer from pervasive action looping and low resolution rates. We introduce SWE-Protégé, a post-training framework that reframes software repair as an expert-protégé collaboration problem. In SWE-Protégé, an SLM remains the sole decision-maker while learning to selectively seek guidance from a strong expert model, recognize stalled states, and follow through on expert feedback. Our approach combines supervised fine-tuning on expert-augmented trajectories with agentic reinforcement learning that explicitly discourages degenerative looping and unproductive expert collaboration. We lightly post-train Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct to achieve 42.4% Pass@1 on SWE-bench Verified, a +25.4% improvement over the prior SLM state of the art, while using expert assistance sparsely (~4 calls per task and 11% of total tokens).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Distributional Treatment of Real2Sim2Real for Object-Centric Agent Adaptation in Vision-Driven Deformable Linear Object Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18615v3)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an integrated (or end-to-end) framework for the Real2Sim2Real problem of manipulating deformable linear objects (DLOs) based on visual perception. Working with a parameterised set of DLOs, we use likelihood-free inference (LFI) to compute the posterior distributions for the physical parameters using which we can approximately simulate the behaviour of each specific DLO. We use these posteriors for domain randomisation while training, in simulation, object-specific visuomotor policies (i.e. assuming only visual and proprioceptive sensory) for a DLO reaching task, using model-free reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by deploying sim-trained DLO manipulation policies in the real world in a zero-shot manner, i.e. without any further fine-tuning. In this context, we evaluate the capacity of a prominent LFI method to perform fine classification over the parametric set of DLOs, using only visual and proprioceptive data obtained in a dynamic manipulation trajectory. We then study the implications of the resulting domain distributions in sim-based policy learning and real-world performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[System Design of the Ultra Mobility Vehicle: A Driving, Balancing, and Jumping Bicycle Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22118v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trials cyclists and mountain bike riders can hop, jump, balance, and drive on one or both wheels. This versatility allows them to achieve speed and energy-efficiency on smooth terrain and agility over rough terrain. Inspired by these athletes, we present the design and control of a robotic platform, Ultra Mobility Vehicle (UMV), which combines a bicycle and a reaction mass to move dynamically with minimal actuated degrees of freedom. We employ a simulation-driven design optimization process to synthesize a spatial linkage topology with a focus on vertical jump height and momentum-based balancing on a single wheel contact. Using a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of diverse athletic behaviors, including track-stands, jumps, wheelies, rear wheel hopping, and front flips. This 23.5 kg robot is capable of high speeds (8 m/s) and jumping on and over large obstacles (1 m tall, or 130% of the robot's nominal height).</p></details> | <details><summary>19 Pa...</summary><p>19 Pages, 11 figures, 3 movies, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[RebuttalAgent: Strategic Persuasion in Academic Rebuttal via Theory of Mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15715v3)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although artificial intelligence (AI) has become deeply integrated into various stages of the research workflow and achieved remarkable advancements, academic rebuttal remains a significant and underexplored challenge. This is because rebuttal is a complex process of strategic communication under severe information asymmetry rather than a simple technical debate. Consequently, current approaches struggle as they largely imitate surface-level linguistics, missing the essential element of perspective-taking required for effective persuasion. In this paper, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first framework to ground academic rebuttal in Theory of Mind (ToM), operationalized through a ToM-Strategy-Response (TSR) framework that models reviewer mental state, formulates persuasion strategy, and generates evidence-based response. To train our agent, we construct RebuttalBench, a large-scale dataset synthesized via a novel critique-and-refine approach. Our training process consists of two stages, beginning with a supervised fine-tuning phase to equip the agent with ToM-based analysis and strategic planning capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning phase leveraging the self-reward mechanism for scalable self-improvement. For reliable and efficient automated evaluation, we further develop Rebuttal-RM, a specialized evaluator trained on over 100K samples of multi-source rebuttal data, which achieves scoring consistency with human preferences surpassing powerful judge GPT-4.1. Extensive experiments show RebuttalAgent significantly outperforms the base model by an average of 18.3% on automated metrics, while also outperforming advanced proprietary models across both automated and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[PanoEnv: Exploring 3D Spatial Intelligence in Panoramic Environments with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21992v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>360 panoramic images are increasingly used in virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics for holistic scene understanding. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with 3D spatial reasoning on Equirectangular Projection (ERP) images due to geometric distortion and limited 3D supervision. We introduce PanoEnv, a large-scale VQA benchmark built from synthetic 3D environments, containing 14.8K questions across five categories (e.g., relative position, volume comparison) grounded in accurate 3D annotations including depth, segmentation, and bounding boxes. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals limited 3D understanding, achieving only 49.34% overall accuracy and 8.36% on open-ended (OE) questions. To enhance 3D reasoning, we propose a reinforcement learning post-training framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a ground-truth-guided reward that incorporates five geometry-aware strategies such as distance tolerance and spatial consistency. A two-stage curriculum further mitigates catastrophic forgetting: Stage 1 trains on structured tasks (true/false and multiple choice), and Stage 2 fine-tunes on mixed open-ended data to improve generalization. Our 7B model achieves new state-of-the-art performance, improving overall accuracy to 52.93% (+3.59%) and open-ended accuracy to 14.83% while maintaining structured-task performance. It also achieves top semantic evaluation scores (Q-Score 6.24, P-Score 5.95), surpassing 32B models. These results demonstrate that PanoEnv-QA and our curriculum-based RL framework effectively instill 3D spatial intelligence in VLMs for omnidirectional perception.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum feedback control with a transformer neural network architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19253v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention-based neural networks such as transformers have revolutionized various fields such as natural language processing, genomics, and vision. Here, we demonstrate the use of transformers for quantum feedback control through both a supervised and reinforcement learning approach. In particular, due to the transformer's ability to capture long-range temporal correlations and training efficiency, we show that it can surpass some of the limitations of previous control approaches, e.g.~those based on recurrent neural networks trained using a similar approach or policy based reinforcement learning. We numerically show, for the example of state stabilization of a two-level system, that our bespoke transformer architecture can achieve near unit fidelity to a target state in a short time even in the presence of inefficient measurement and Hamiltonian perturbations that were not included in the training set as well as the control of non-Markovian systems. We also demonstrate that our transformer can perform energy minimization of non-integrable many-body quantum systems when trained for reinforcement learning tasks. Our approach can be used for quantum error correction, fast control of quantum states in the presence of colored noise, as well as real-time tuning, and characterization of quantum devices.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[RADAR: Reasoning as Discrimination with Aligned Representations for LLM-based Knowledge Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21951v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) infers missing facts, with recent advances increasingly harnessing the semantic priors and reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevailing generative paradigms are prone to memorizing surface-level co-occurrences rather than learning genuine relational semantics, limiting out-of-distribution generalization. To address this, we propose RADAR, which reformulates KGR from generative pattern matching to discriminative relational reasoning. We recast KGR as discriminative entity selection, where reinforcement learning enforces relative entity separability beyond token-likelihood imitation. Leveraging this separability, inference operates directly in representation space, ensuring consistency with the discriminative optimization and bypassing generation-induced hallucinations. Across four benchmarks, RADAR achieves 5-6% relative gains on link prediction and triple classification over strong LLM baselines, while increasing task-relevant mutual information in intermediate representations by 62.9%, indicating more robust and transferable relational reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[FigEx2: Visual-Conditioned Panel Detection and Captioning for Scientific Compound Figures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08026v3)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific compound figures combine multiple labeled panels into a single image, but captions in real pipelines are often missing or only provide figure-level summaries, making panel-level understanding difficult. In this paper, we propose FigEx2, visual-conditioned framework that localizes panels and generates panel-wise captions directly from the compound figure. To mitigate the impact of diverse phrasing in open-ended captioning, we introduce a noise-aware gated fusion module that adaptively filters token-level features to stabilize the detection query space. Furthermore, we employ a staged optimization strategy combining supervised learning with reinforcement learning (RL), utilizing CLIP-based alignment and BERTScore-based semantic rewards to enforce strict multimodal consistency. To support high-quality supervision, we curate BioSci-Fig-Cap, a refined benchmark for panel-level grounding, alongside cross-disciplinary test suites in physics and chemistry. Experimental results demonstrate that FigEx2 achieves a superior 0.726 mAP@0.5:0.95 for detection and significantly outperforms Qwen3-VL-8B by 0.51 in METEOR and 0.24 in BERTScore. Notably, FigEx2 exhibits remarkable zero-shot transferability to out-of-distribution scientific domains without any fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArtVIP: Articulated Digital Assets of Visual Realism, Modular Interaction, and Physical Fidelity for Robot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04941v3)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning increasingly relies on simulation to advance complex ability such as dexterous manipulations and precise interactions, necessitating high-quality digital assets to bridge the sim-to-real gap. However, existing open-source articulated-object datasets for simulation are limited by insufficient visual realism and low physical fidelity, which hinder their utility for training models mastering robotic tasks in real world. To address these challenges, we introduce ArtVIP, a comprehensive open-source dataset comprising high-quality digital-twin articulated objects, accompanied by indoor-scene assets. Crafted by professional 3D modelers adhering to unified standards, ArtVIP ensures visual realism through precise geometric meshes and high-resolution textures, while physical fidelity is achieved via fine-tuned dynamic parameters. Meanwhile, the dataset pioneers embedded modular interaction behaviors within assets and pixel-level affordance annotations. Feature-map visualization and optical motion capture are employed to quantitatively demonstrate ArtVIP's visual and physical fidelity, with its applicability validated across imitation learning and reinforcement learning experiments. Provided in USD format with detailed production guidelines, ArtVIP is fully open-source, benefiting the research community and advancing robot learning research.

| **[ExpLang: Improved Exploration and Exploitation in LLM Reasoning with On-Policy Thinking Language Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21887v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown strong ability on challenging tasks after reinforcement learning (RL) based post-training. However, previous work mainly focuses on English reasoning in expectation of the strongest performance, despite the demonstrated potential advantage of multilingual thinking, as well as the requirement for native thinking traces by global users. In this paper, we propose ExpLang, a novel LLM post-training pipeline that enables on-policy thinking language selection to improve exploration and exploitation during RL with the use of multiple languages. The results show that our method steadily outperforms English-only training with the same training budget, while showing high thinking language compliance for both seen and unseen languages. Analysis shows that, by enabling on-policy thinking language selection as an action during RL, ExpLang effectively extends the RL exploration space with diversified language preference and improves the RL exploitation outcome with leveraged non-English advantage. The method is orthogonal to most RL algorithms and opens up a new perspective on using multilinguality to improve LRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distill and Align Decomposition for Enhanced Claim Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21857v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex claim verification requires decomposing sentences into verifiable subclaims, yet existing methods struggle to align decomposition quality with verification performance. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that jointly optimizes decomposition quality and verifier alignment using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method integrates: (i) structured sequential reasoning; (ii) supervised finetuning on teacher-distilled exemplars; and (iii) a multi-objective reward balancing format compliance, verifier alignment, and decomposition quality. Across six evaluation settings, our trained 8B decomposer improves downstream verification performance to (71.75%) macro-F1, outperforming prompt-based approaches ((+1.99), (+6.24)) and existing RL methods ((+5.84)). Human evaluation confirms the high quality of the generated subclaims. Our framework enables smaller language models to achieve state-of-the-art claim verification by jointly optimising for verification accuracy and decomposition quality.</p></details> | EACL Findings 2026 |
| **[Object-Centric World Models from Few-Shot Annotations for Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16443v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep reinforcement learning (RL) from pixels has achieved remarkable success, its sample inefficiency remains a critical limitation for real-world applications. Model-based RL (MBRL) addresses this by learning a world model to generate simulated experience, but standard approaches that rely on pixel-level reconstruction losses often fail to capture small, task-critical objects in complex, dynamic scenes. We posit that an object-centric (OC) representation can direct model capacity toward semantically meaningful entities, improving dynamics prediction and sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce OC-STORM, an object-centric MBRL framework that enhances a learned world model with object representations extracted by a pretrained segmentation network. By conditioning on a minimal number of annotated frames, OC-STORM learns to track decision-relevant object dynamics and inter-object interactions without extensive labeling or access to privileged information. Empirical results demonstrate that OC-STORM significantly outperforms the STORM baseline on the Atari 100k benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art sample efficiency on challenging boss fights in the visually complex game Hollow Knight. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating OC priors into MBRL for complex visual domains. Project page: https://oc-storm.weipuzhang.com</p></details> |  |

We propose Knowledgeable-R1, a reinforcement-learning framework that explicitly trains large language models to use parametric knowledge (PK) to resist contextual interference while still exploiting external context when it is reliably helpful. Knowledgeable-R1 introduces a joint sampling scheme that generates paired responses with and without retrieval, and learns both local advantages (within each decoding regime) and global advantages under the same input to quantify when to ignore misleading context versus adopt it. We employ an asymmetric advantage transformation that amplifies exploratory behaviors toward parametric knowledge. Experiments show that Knowledgeable-R1 significantly improves robustness and reasoning accuracy in knowledge conflict scenarios and general RAG scenarios, outperforming SOTA baselines by +22.89% in counterfactual scenarios, and without degradation when the retrieved context is fully accurate.Our code are available at https://github.com/lcy80366872/knowledgeable-R1.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Depth-Breadth Synergy in RLVR: Unlocking LLM Reasoning Gains with Adaptive Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13755v6)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions: Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance. Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the reasoning power of RLVR.</p></details> | 20 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Self-Curriculum Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Shape Control of Deformable Linear Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21816v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise shape control of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) is crucial in robotic applications such as industrial and medical fields. However, existing methods face challenges in handling complex large deformation tasks, especially those involving opposite curvatures, and lack efficiency and precision. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and online visual servoing. In the large-deformation stage, a model-based reinforcement learning approach using an ensemble of dynamics models is introduced to significantly improve sample efficiency. Additionally, we design a self-curriculum goal generation mechanism that dynamically selects intermediate-difficulty goals with high diversity through imagined evaluations, thereby optimizing the policy learning process. In the small-deformation stage, a Jacobian-based visual servo controller is deployed to ensure high-precision convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed method enables efficient policy learning and significantly outperforms mainstream baselines in shape control success rate and precision. Furthermore, the framework effectively transfers the policy trained in simulation to real-world tasks with zero-shot adaptation. It successfully completes all 30 cases with diverse initial and target shapes across DLOs of different sizes and materials.

| **[DexRepNet++: Learning Dexterous Robotic Manipulation with Geometric and Spatial Hand-Object Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21811v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic dexterous manipulation is a challenging problem due to high degrees of freedom (DoFs) and complex contacts of multi-fingered robotic hands. Many existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods aim at improving sample efficiency in high-dimensional output action spaces. However, existing works often overlook the role of representations in achieving generalization of a manipulation policy in the complex input space during the hand-object interaction. In this paper, we propose DexRep, a novel hand-object interaction representation to capture object surface features and spatial relations between hands and objects for dexterous manipulation skill learning. Based on DexRep, policies are learned for three dexterous manipulation tasks, i.e. grasping, in-hand reorientation, bimanual handover, and extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness. In simulation, for grasping, the policy learned with 40 objects achieves a success rate of 87.9% on more than 5000 unseen objects of diverse categories, significantly surpassing existing work trained with thousands of objects; for the in-hand reorientation and handover tasks, the policies also boost the success rates and other metrics of existing hand-object representations by 20% to 40%. The grasp policies with DexRep are deployed to the real world under multi-camera and single-camera setups and demonstrate a small sim-to-real gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2026</p></details> |
| **[Generalisation of RLHF under Reward Shift and Clipped KL Regularisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21765v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment and adaptation in large language models heavily rely on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF); yet, theoretical understanding of its generalisability remains premature, especially when the learned reward could shift, and the KL control is estimated and clipped. To address this issue, we develop generalisation theory for RLHF that explicitly accounts for (1) \emph{reward shift}: reward models are trained on preference data from earlier or mixed behaviour policies while RLHF optimises the current policy on its own rollouts; and (2) \emph{clipped KL regularisation}: the KL regulariser is estimated from sampled log-probability ratios and then clipped for stabilisation, resulting in an error to RLHF. We present generalisation bounds for RLHF, suggesting that the generalisation error stems from a sampling error from prompts and rollouts, a reward shift error, and a KL clipping error. We also discuss special cases of (1) initialising RLHF parameters with a uniform prior over a finite space, and (2) training RLHF by stochastic gradient descent, as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The theory yields practical implications in (1) optimal KL clipping threshold, and (2) budget allocation in prompts, rollouts, and preference data.</p></details> |  |
| **[V-Retrver: Evidence-Driven Agentic Reasoning for Universal Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06034v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently been applied to universal multimodal retrieval, where Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves candidate reranking. However, existing approaches remain largely language-driven, relying on static visual encodings and lacking the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, which often leads to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases. We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective. Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (with 23.0% improvements on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/chendy25/V-Retrver</p></details> |
| **[Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04579v3)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control is a sampling-based optimization method that has recently attracted attention, particularly in the robotics and reinforcement learning communities. MPPI has been widely applied as a GPU-accelerated random search method to deterministic direct single-shooting optimal control problems arising in model predictive control (MPC) formulations. MPPI offers several key advantages, including flexibility, robustness, ease of implementation, and inherent parallelizability. However, its performance can deteriorate in high-dimensional settings since the optimal control problem is solved via Monte Carlo sampling. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an enhanced MPPI method that incorporates a Jacobian reconstruction technique and the second-order Generalized Gauss-Newton method. This novel approach is called \textit{Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI}. The numerical results show that the Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI approach substantially improves MPPI scalability and computational efficiency while preserving the key benefits of the classical MPPI framework, making it a promising approach even for high-dimensional problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to the IFAC World Congress 2026, parts of this preprint are directly taken from Chapter 3 of the main author's PhD thesis with title "Optimal Control for Efficient Vessel Operation: From Theory to Real-World Applications"</p></details> |
| **[RABot: Reinforcement-Guided Graph Augmentation for Imbalanced and Noisy Social Bot Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21749v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social bot detection is pivotal for safeguarding the integrity of online information ecosystems. Although recent graph neural network (GNN) solutions achieve strong results, they remain hindered by two practical challenges: (i) severe class imbalance arising from the high cost of generating bots, and (ii) topological noise introduced by bots that skillfully mimic human behavior and forge deceptive links. We propose the Reinforcement-guided graph Augmentation social Bot detector (RABot), a multi-granularity graph-augmentation framework that addresses both issues in a unified manner. RABot employs a neighborhood-aware oversampling strategy that linearly interpolates minority-class embeddings within local subgraphs, thereby stabilizing the decision boundary under low-resource regimes. Concurrently, a reinforcement-learning-driven edge-filtering module combines similarity-based edge features with adaptive threshold optimization to excise spurious interactions during message passing, yielding a cleaner topology. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks and four GNN backbones demonstrate that RABot consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, since its augmentation and filtering modules are orthogonal to the underlying architecture, RABot can be seamlessly integrated into existing GNN pipelines to boost performance with minimal overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Multi-Modal LLMs Reasoning via Difficulty-Aware Group Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21743v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models. Extending these methods to multimodal settings, however, faces a critical challenge: the instability of std-based normalization, which is easily distorted by extreme samples with nearly positive or negative rewards. Unlike pure-text LLMs, multimodal models are particularly sensitive to such distortions, as both perceptual and reasoning errors influence their responses. To address this, we characterize each sample by its difficulty, defined through perceptual complexity (measured via visual entropy) and reasoning uncertainty (captured by model confidence). Building on this characterization, we propose difficulty-aware group normalization (Durian), which re-groups samples by difficulty levels and shares the std within each group. Our approach preserves GRPO's intra-group distinctions while eliminating sensitivity to extreme cases, yielding significant performance gains across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Art of Efficient Reasoning: Data, Reward, and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20945v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) consistently benefit from scaled Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but also suffer from heavy computational overhead. To address this issue, efficient reasoning aims to incentivize short yet accurate thinking trajectories, typically through reward shaping with Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we systematically investigate the mechanics of efficient reasoning for LLMs. For comprehensive evaluation, we advocate for more fine-grained metrics, including length distribution conditioned on correctness and performance across a wide spectrum of token budgets ranging from 2k to 32k. First, we reveal that the training process follows a two-stage paradigm: length adaptation and reasoning refinement. After that, we conduct extensive experiments (about 0.2 million GPU hours) in a unified protocol, deconstructing training prompts and rollouts, reward shaping, and optimization strategies. In particular, a key finding is to train on relatively easier prompts, ensuring the density of positive reward signals and thus avoiding the length collapse. Meanwhile, the learned length bias can be generalized across domains. We distill all findings into valuable insights and practical guidelines, and further validate them across the Qwen3 series, ranging from 0.6B to 30B, demonstrating the robustness and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech Report, Insights on Efficient Reasoning via Reward Shaping</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Cross-Domain Offline Reinforcement Learning with Dynamics- and Value-Aligned Data Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02435v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to train a well-performing agent in the target environment, leveraging both a limited target domain dataset and a source domain dataset with (possibly) sufficient data coverage. Due to the underlying dynamics misalignment between source and target domains, naively merging the two datasets may incur inferior performance. Recent advances address this issue by selectively leveraging source domain samples whose dynamics align well with the target domain. However, our work demonstrates that dynamics alignment alone is insufficient, by examining the limitations of prior frameworks and deriving a new target domain sub-optimality bound for the policy learned on the source domain. More importantly, our theory underscores an additional need for \textit{value alignment}, i.e., selecting high-quality, high-value samples from the source domain, a critical dimension overlooked by existing works. Motivated by such theoretical insight, we propose \textbf{\underline{D}}ynamics- and \textbf{\underline{V}}alue-aligned \textbf{\underline{D}}ata \textbf{\underline{F}}iltering (DVDF) method, a novel unified cross-domain RL framework that selectively incorporates source domain samples exhibiting strong alignment in \textit{both dynamics and values}. We empirically study a range of dynamics shift scenarios, including kinematic and morphology shifts, and evaluate DVDF on various tasks and datasets, even in the challenging setting where the target domain dataset contains an extremely limited amount of data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVDF consistently outperforms strong baselines with significant improvements.</p></details> |  |

A promising solution is to ground LLMs' answers in verifiable knowledge sources, such as Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Prevailing KG-enhanced methods typically constrained LLM reasoning either by enforcing rules during generation or by imitating paths from a fixed set of demonstrations. However, they naturally confined the reasoning patterns of LLMs within the scope of prior experience or fine-tuning data, limiting their generalizability to out-of-distribution graph reasoning problems. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose Explore-on-Graph (EoG), a novel framework that encourages LLMs to autonomously explore a more diverse reasoning space on KGs. To incentivize exploration and discovery of novel reasoning paths, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning during training, whose reward is the correctness of the reasoning paths' final answers. To enhance the efficiency and meaningfulness of the exploration, we propose to incorporate path information as additional reward signals to refine the exploration process and reduce futile efforts. Extensive experiments on five KGQA benchmark datasets demonstrate that, to the best of our knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming not only open-source but also even closed-source LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Existing approaches rely on reference motions or task-specific rewards, tightly coupling policies to particular object geometries and precluding multi-skill generalization within a single framework. A unified interaction representation enabling reference-free inference, geometric generalization, and long-horizon skill composition within one policy remains an open challenge. Here we show that Distance Field (DF) provides such a representation: LessMimic conditions a single whole-body policy on DF-derived geometric cues--surface distances, gradients, and velocity decompositions--removing the need for motion references, with interaction latents encoded via a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and post-trained using Adversarial Interaction Priors (AIP) under Reinforcement Learning (RL). Through DAgger-style distillation that aligns DF latents with egocentric depth features, LessMimic further transfers seamlessly to vision-only deployment without motion capture (MoCap) infrastructure. A single LessMimic policy achieves 80--100% success across object scales from 0.4x to 1.6x on PickUp and SitStand where baselines degrade sharply, attains 62.1% success on 5 task instances trajectories, and remains viable up to 40 sequentially composed tasks. By grounding interaction in local geometry rather than demonstrations, LessMimic offers a scalable path toward humanoid robots that generalize, compose skills, and recover from failures in unstructured environments.</p></details> |  |

Following prior work that relates cross-linguistic tendencies to biases in learning, we ask whether regular systems are common because regularity facilitates learning. Adopting methods from the Reinforcement Learning literature, we confirm that highly regular human(-like) systems are easier to learn than unattested but possible irregular systems. This asymmetry emerges under the natural assumption that recursive numeral systems are designed for generalisation from limited data to represent all integers exactly. We also find that the influence of regularity on learnability is absent for unnatural, highly irregular systems, whose learnability is influenced instead by signal length, suggesting that different pressures may influence learnability differently in different parts of the space of possible numeral systems. Our results contribute to the body of work linking learnability to cross-linguistic prevalence.</p></details> |  |

Work in cognitive science has demonstrated that humans tend towards higher levels of abstraction when engaged in collaborative task-oriented communication, enabling gradually shorter and more information-efficient utterances. Several computational methods have attempted to replicate this phenomenon, but all make unrealistic simplifying assumptions about how abstractions are introduced and learned. Our method, Procedural Abstractions for Communicating Efficiently (PACE), overcomes these limitations through a neuro-symbolic approach. On the symbolic side, we draw on work from library learning for proposing abstractions. We combine this with neural methods for communication and reinforcement learning, via a novel use of bandit algorithms for controlling the exploration and exploitation trade-off in introducing new abstractions. PACE exhibits similar tendencies to humans on a collaborative construction task from the cognitive science literature, where one agent (the architect) instructs the other (the builder) to reconstruct a scene of block-buildings. PACE results in the emergence of an efficient language as a by-product of collaborative communication. Beyond providing mechanistic insights into human communication, our work serves as a first step to providing conversational agents with the ability for human-like communicative abstractions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CogSci 2025 for presentation</p></details> |
| **[Two-Stage Active Distribution Network Voltage Control via LLM-RL Collaboration: A Hybrid Knowledge-Data-Driven Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21715v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing integration of distributed photovoltaics (PVs) into active distribution networks (ADNs) has exacerbated operational challenges, making it imperative to coordinate diverse equipment to mitigate voltage violations and enhance power quality. Although existing data-driven approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in the voltage control problem, they often require extensive trial-and-error exploration and struggle to incorporate heterogeneous information, such as day-ahead forecasts and semantic-based grid codes. Considering the operational scenarios and requirements in real-world ADNs, in this paper, we propose a hybrid knowledge-data-driven approach that leverages dynamic collaboration between a large language model (LLM) agent and a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to achieve two-stage voltage control. In the day-ahead stage, the LLM agent receives coarse region-level forecasts and generates scheduling strategies for on-load tap changer (OLTC) and shunt capacitors (SCs) to regulate the overall voltage profile. Then in the intra-day stage, based on accurate node-level measurements, the RL agent refines terminal voltages by deriving reactive power generation strategies for PV inverters. On top of the LLM-RL collaboration framework, we further propose a self-evolution mechanism for the LLM agent and a pretrain-finetune pipeline for the RL agent, effectively enhancing and coordinating the policies for both agents. The proposed approach not only aligns more closely with practical operational characteristics but also effectively utilizes the inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the LLM agent, significantly improving training efficiency and voltage control performance. Comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, it often relies on gold-standard answers or explicit evaluation rubrics provided by powerful teacher models or human experts, which are costly and time-consuming. In this work, we investigate unsupervised approaches to enhance the long-context capabilities of LLMs, eliminating the need for heavy human annotations or teacher models' supervision. Specifically, we first replace a few paragraphs with special placeholders in a long document. LLMs are trained through reinforcement learning to reconstruct the document by correctly identifying and sequencing missing paragraphs from a set of candidate options. This training paradigm enables the model to capture global narrative coherence, significantly boosting long-context performance. We validate the effectiveness of our method on two widely used benchmarks, RULER and LongBench~v2. While acquiring noticeable gains on RULER, it can also achieve a reasonable improvement on LongBench~v2 without any manually curated long-context QA data. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation studies to analyze the impact of reward design, data curation strategies, training schemes, and data scaling effects on model performance. We publicly release our code, data, and models.</p></details> |  |

Most existing learning-based methods are trained on image pairs, a paradigm that fails to explicitly optimize for the long-term trackability of keypoints across sequences under challenging viewpoint and illumination changes. In this paper, we reframe keypoint detection as a sequential decision-making problem. We introduce TraqPoint, a novel, end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework designed to optimize the \textbf{Tra}ck-\textbf{q}uality (Traq) of keypoints directly on image sequences. Our core innovation is a track-aware reward mechanism that jointly encourages the consistency and distinctiveness of keypoints across multiple views, guided by a policy gradient method. Extensive evaluations on sparse matching benchmarks, including relative pose estimation and 3D reconstruction, demonstrate that TraqPoint significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art (SOTA) keypoint detection and description methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are unresolved issues regarding authorship and manuscript details.

In this paper, we introduce a novel sequential training scheme and MARL architecture, which learns from multiple perspectives on different hierarchy levels. We propose the Hierarchical Lead Critic (HLC) - inspired by natural emerging distributions in team structures, where following high-level objectives combines with low-level execution. HLC demonstrates that introducing multiple hierarchies, leveraging local and global perspectives, can lead to improved performance with high sample efficiency and robust policies. Experimental results conducted on cooperative, non-communicative, and partially observable MARL benchmarks demonstrate that HLC outperforms single hierarchy baselines and scales robustly with increasing amounts of agents and difficulty.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 Figures, Preprint</p></details> |

However, prevailing agentic RAG approaches are constrained by a critical limitation: they treat the retrieval process as a black-box querying operation. This confines agents' actions to query issuing, hindering its ability to tackle complex information-seeking tasks. To address this, we introduce Interact-RAG, a new paradigm that elevates the LLM agent from a passive query issuer into an active manipulator of the retrieval process. We dismantle the black-box with a Corpus Interaction Engine, equipping the agent with a set of action primitives for fine-grained control over information retrieval. To further empower the agent on the entire RAG pipeline, we first develop a reasoning-enhanced workflow, which enables both zero-shot execution and the synthesis of interaction trajectories. We then leverage this synthetic data to train a fully autonomous end-to-end agent via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by refinement with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that Interact-RAG significantly outperforms other advanced methods, validating the efficacy of our reasoning-interaction strategy.</p></details> |  |

Although recent work explores various forms of reward shaping and step-level credit assignment, a key signal remains largely overlooked: the intrinsic uncertainty of LLMs. Uncertainty reflects model confidence, reveals where exploration is needed, and offers valuable learning cues even in failed trajectories. We introduce SELAUR: Self Evolving LLM Agent via Uncertainty-aware Rewards, a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates uncertainty directly into the reward design. SELAUR integrates entropy-, least-confidence-, and margin-based metrics into a combined token-level uncertainty estimate, providing dense confidence-aligned supervision, and employs a failure-aware reward reshaping mechanism that injects these uncertainty signals into step- and trajectory-level rewards to improve exploration efficiency and learning stability. Experiments on two benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, show that our method consistently improves success rates over strong baselines. Ablation studies further demonstrate how uncertainty signals enhance exploration and robustness.</p></details> | Accepted by PAKDD'26 |

Because human annotations reflect subjective preferences and expertise, ground-truth captions are often incomplete or even incorrect, which in turn limits caption models. We argue that caption quality should be assessed by two objective aspects: completeness (does the caption cover all salient visual facts?) and correctness (are the descriptions true with respect to the image?). To this end, we introduce CCCaption: a dual-reward reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated fine-tuning corpus that explicitly optimizes these properties to generate \textbf{C}omplete and \textbf{C}orrect \textbf{Captions}. For completeness, we use diverse LVLMs to disentangle the image into a set of visual queries, and reward captions that answer more of these queries, with a dynamic query sampling strategy to improve training efficiency. For correctness, we penalize captions that contain hallucinations by validating the authenticity of sub-caption queries, which are derived from the caption decomposition. Our symmetric dual-reward optimization jointly maximizes completeness and correctness, guiding models toward captions that better satisfy these objective criteria. Extensive experiments across standard captioning benchmarks show consistent improvements, offering a principled path to training caption models beyond human-annotation imitation.</p></details> | Accept by CVPR 2026 |

However, applying RL to open-domain tasks faces two key challenges: (1) the inherent subjectivity of these tasks prevents the verifiable rewards as required by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR); (2) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) relies on external reward mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Self-Examining Reinforcement Learning (SERL), a novel self-improving framework where the LLM serves as both Actor and Judge. SERL introduces two synergistic reward mechanisms without any external signals. On the one hand, to improve the Actor's capability, we derive rewards from Copeland-style pairwise comparison judgments across a group of generated responses. On the other hand, a self-consistency reward that encourages coherent judgments is proposed to improve the Judge's reliability. This process refines the Judge's capability, which in turn provides a more robust reward for Actor. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing self-improvement training methods. SERL improves the LC win rate of Qwen3-8B on AlpacaEval 2 from 52.37% to 59.90%. To the best of our knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-improving approaches. Furthermore, it achieves a performance comparable to significantly larger models like Qwen3-32B, demonstrating superior effectiveness and robustness on open-domain tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 40th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Self-Correcting VLA: Online Action Refinement via Sparse World Imagination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21633v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard vision-language-action (VLA) models rely on fitting statistical data priors, limiting their robust understanding of underlying physical dynamics. Reinforcement learning enhances physical grounding through exploration yet typically relies on external reward signals that remain isolated from the agent's internal states. World action models have emerged as a promising paradigm that integrates imagination and control to enable predictive planning. However, they rely on implicit context modeling, lacking explicit mechanisms for self-improvement. To solve these problems, we propose Self-Correcting VLA (SC-VLA), which achieve self-improvement by intrinsically guiding action refinement through sparse imagination. We first design sparse world imagination by integrating auxiliary predictive heads to forecast current task progress and future trajectory trends, thereby constraining the policy to encode short-term physical evolution. Then we introduce the online action refinement module to reshape progress-dependent dense rewards, adjusting trajectory orientation based on the predicted sparse future states. Evaluations on challenging robot manipulation tasks from simulation benchmarks and real-world settings demonstrate that SC-VLA achieve state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest task throughput with 16% fewer steps and a 9% higher success rate than the best-performing baselines, alongside a 14% gain in real-world experiments.

However, relying solely on outcome supervision risks reward hacking, where models learn spurious reasoning patterns to satisfy final answer checks. While recent rubric-based approaches offer fine-grained supervision signals, they suffer from high computational costs of instance-level generation and inefficient training dynamics caused by treating all rubrics as equally learnable. In this paper, we propose Stratified Rubric-based Curriculum Learning (RuCL), a novel framework that reformulates curriculum learning by shifting the focus from data selection to reward design. RuCL generates generalized rubrics for broad applicability and stratifies them based on the model's competence. By dynamically adjusting rubric weights during training, RuCL guides the model from mastering foundational perception to tackling advanced logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on various visual reasoning benchmarks show that RuCL yields a remarkable +7.83% average improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, achieving a state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.06%.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Current tactile simulations suffer from a persistent dilemma: simplified geometric projections lack physical authenticity, while high-fidelity Finite Element Methods (FEM) are too computationally prohibitive for large-scale reinforcement learning. In this work, we present Tacmap, a high-fidelity, computationally efficient tactile simulation framework anchored in volumetric penetration depth. Our key insight is to bridge the tactile sim-to-real gap by unifying both domains through a shared deform map representation. Specifically, we compute 3D intersection volumes as depth maps in simulation, while in the real world, we employ an automated data-collection rig to learn a robust mapping from raw tactile images to ground-truth depth maps. By aligning simulation and real-world in this unified geometric space, Tacmap minimizes domain shift while maintaining physical consistency. Quantitative evaluations across diverse contact scenarios demonstrate that Tacmap's deform maps closely mirror real-world measurements. Moreover, we validate the utility of Tacmap through an in-hand rotation task, where a policy trained exclusively in simulation achieves zero-shot transfer to a physical robot.</p></details> | 8 pages |

To address this, we propose a preference-aligned audio captioning framework based on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). To capture nuanced preferences, we train a Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) based reward model using human-labeled pairwise preference data. This reward model is integrated into an RL framework to fine-tune any baseline captioning system without ground-truth annotations. Extensive human evaluations across multiple datasets show that our method produces captions preferred over baseline models, particularly when baselines fail to provide correct and natural captions. Furthermore, our framework achieves performance comparable to supervised approaches with ground-truth data, demonstrating effective alignment with human preferences and scalability in real-world use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for review to Interspeech 2026</p></details> |

However, manually designing piecewise deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents cannot keep pace with frequent dynamics shifts and service-level agreement (SLA) changes of an evolving DC. This specification-to-policy lag causes a lack of timely, effective control policies, which may lead to service outages. To bridge the gap, we present DCoPilot, a hybrid framework for generative control policies in dynamic DC operation. DCoPilot synergizes two distinct generative paradigms, i.e., a large language model (LLM) that performs symbolic generation of structured reward forms, and a hypernetwork that conducts parametric generation of policy weights. DCoPilot operates through three coordinated phases: (i) simulation scale-up, which stress-tests reward candidates across diverse simulation-ready (SimReady) scenes; (ii) meta policy distillation, where a hypernetwork is trained to output policy weights conditioned on SLA and scene embeddings; and (iii) online adaptation, enabling zero-shot policy generation in response to updated specifications. Evaluated across five control task families spanning diverse DC components, DCoPilot achieves near-zero constraint violations and outperforms all baselines across specification variations. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of LLM-based unified reward generation in enabling stable hypernetwork convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper at HSCC/ICCPS 2026</p></details> |

While model-based controllers can achieve high motion accuracy under nominal conditions, their robustness and responsiveness often degrade in the presence of disturbances and modeling uncertainties. This work investigates reinforcement learning for omnidirectional aerial motion control on over-actuated tiltable quadrotors that prioritizes robustness and agility. We present a learning-based control framework that enables efficient acquisition of coordinated rotor-joint behaviors for reaching target poses in the $SE(3)$ space. To achieve reliable sim-to-real transfer while preserving motion accuracy, we integrate system identification with minimal and physically consistent domain randomization. Compared with a state-of-the-art NMPC controller, the proposed method achieves comparable six-degree-of-freedom pose tracking accuracy, while demonstrating superior robustness and generalization across diverse tasks, enabling zero-shot deployment on real hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolutionary System Prompt Learning for Reinforcement Learning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14697v3)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building agentic systems that can autonomously self-improve from experience is a longstanding goal of AI. Large language models (LLMs) today primarily self-improve via two mechanisms: self-reflection for context updates, and reinforcement learning (RL) for weight updates. In this work, we propose Evolutionary System Prompt Learning (E-SPL), a method for jointly improving model contexts and model weights. In each RL iteration, E-SPL samples trajectories under multiple system prompts in parallel, then jointly applies RL updates to LLM weights and evolutionary updates to system prompts. System prompts evolve via mutation and crossover, two genetic operators driven by LLM self-reflection; selection is based on relative performance ratings updated across RL iterations. E-SPL encourages a natural division between declarative knowledge encoded in prompts and procedural knowledge encoded in weights, resulting in improved performance across reasoning and agentic tasks. For instance, in an easy-to-hard (AIME $\rightarrow$ BeyondAIME) generalization setting, E-SPL improves RL success rate from 38.8% $\rightarrow$ 45.1% while also outperforming reflective prompt evolution (40.0%). Overall, our results demonstrate that RL and system prompt evolution are deeply synergistic, and combining the two yields consistent gains in sample efficiency and generalization.

Despite encouraging early results, ARL remains highly unstable, often leading to training collapse. This instability limits scalability to larger environments and longer interaction horizons, and constrains systematic exploration of algorithmic design choices. In this paper, we first propose ARLArena, a stable training recipe and systematic analysis framework that examines training stability in a controlled and reproducible setting. ARLArena first constructs a clean and standardized testbed. Then, we decompose policy gradient into four core design dimensions and assess the performance and stability of each dimension. Through this fine-grained analysis, we distill a unified perspective on ARL and propose SAMPO, a stable agentic policy optimization method designed to mitigate the dominant sources of instability in ARL. Empirically, SAMPO achieves consistently stable training and strong performance across diverse agentic tasks. Overall, this study provides a unifying policy gradient perspective for ARL and offers practical guidance for building stable and reproducible LLM-based agent training pipelines.</p></details> |  |

Tool-Expertise-Aware Chest X-ray Agent with Multimodal Agentic Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21517v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents with tool-use capabilities show promise for integrating the domain expertise of various tools. In the medical field, however, tools are usually AI models that are inherently error-prone and can produce contradictory responses. Existing research on medical agents lacks sufficient understanding of the tools' realistic reliability and thus cannot effectively resolve tool conflicts. To address this gap, this paper introduces a framework that enables an agent to interact with tools and empirically learn their practical trustworthiness across different types of multimodal queries via agentic learning. As a concrete instantiation, we focus on chest X-ray analysis and present a tool-expertise-aware chest X-ray agent (TEA-CXA). When tool outputs disagree, the agent experimentally accepts or rejects multimodal tool results, receives rewards, and learns which tool to trust for each query type. Importantly, TEA-CXA extends existing codebases for reinforcement learning with multi-turn tool-calling that focus on textual inputs, to support multimodal contexts effectively. In addition, we enhance the codebase for medical use scenarios by supporting multiple tool calls in one turn, parallel tool inference, and multi-image accommodation within a single user query. Our code framework is applicable to general medical research on multi-turn tool-calling reinforcement learning in multimodal settings. Experiments show that TEA-CXA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and a comprehensive set of baselines. Code will be released.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Unfortunately, existing approaches to learning policies for such collaborative problems produce brittle solutions that fail when paired with new partners. We attribute these failures to a combination of free-riding during training and a lack of strategic robustness. To address these problems, we study the concept of strategic risk aversion and interpret it as a principled inductive bias for generalizable cooperation with unseen partners. While strategically risk-averse players are robust to deviations in their partner's behavior by design, we show that, in collaborative games, they also (1) can have better equilibrium outcomes than those at classical game-theoretic concepts like Nash, and (2) exhibit less or no free-riding. Inspired by these insights, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that integrates strategic risk aversion into standard policy optimization methods. Our empirical results across collaborative benchmarks (including an LLM collaboration task) validate our theory and demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves reliable collaboration with heterogeneous and previously unseen partners across collaborative tasks.</p></details> |  |

Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like, fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm for testing autonomous driving policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026.

However, current generative models struggle with objective misalignment and rigid sampling budgets. We present MolFORM, a fast multi-modal flow matching framework for discrete atom types and continuous coordinates. Crucially, to bridge the gap between generative capability and biochemical objectives, we introduce two distinct post-training strategies: (1) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which performs offline alignment using ranked preference pairs; and (2) an online reinforcement learning paradigm that optimizes the generative flow directly on the forward process. Both strategies effectively navigate the chemical space toward high-affinity regions. MolFORM achieves state-of-the-art results on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark (Vina Score -7.60, Diversity 0.75), demonstrating that incorporating preference alignment mechanisms-whether via offline optimization or online reinforcement-is crucial for steering generative models toward high-affinity binding regions.

However, CoT reasoning in multimodal contexts is highly vulnerable to visual hallucination propagation: once an intermediate reasoning step becomes inconsistent with the visual evidence, subsequent steps-even if logically valid-can still lead to incorrect final answers. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this issue by training models to "think with images" via reinforcement learning (RL). While effective, these methods are costly, model-specific, and difficult to generalize across architectures. Differently, we present a lightweight method that bypasses RL training and provides an iterative, training-free, plug-and-play framework for visually-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our key idea is to supervise each reasoning step at test time with visual evidence, ensuring that every decoded token is justified by corresponding visual cues. Concretely, we construct a textual visual-evidence pool that guides the model's reasoning generation. When existing evidence is insufficient, a visual decider module dynamically extracts additional relevant evidence from the image based on the ongoing reasoning context, expanding the pool until the model achieves sufficient visual certainty to terminate reasoning and produce the final answer. Extensive experiments on multiple LVLM backbones and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method achieves 16.5%-29.5% improvements on TreeBench and 13.7% RH-AUC gains on RH-Bench, substantially reducing hallucination rates while improving reasoning accuracy without additional training.</p></details> | CVPR2026 Accepted |
| **[Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning with centralized training and decentralized execution for transportation infrastructure management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12455v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Life-cycle management of large-scale transportation systems requires determining a sequence of inspection and maintenance decisions to minimize long-term risks and costs while dealing with multiple uncertainties and constraints that lie in high-dimensional spaces. Traditional approaches have been widely applied but often suffer from limitations related to optimality, scalability, and the ability to properly handle uncertainty. Moreover, many existing methods rely on unconstrained formulations that overlook critical operational constraints. We address these issues in this work by casting the optimization problem within the framework of constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), which provide a robust mathematical foundation for stochastic sequential decision-making under observation uncertainties, in the presence of risk and resource limitations. To tackle the high dimensionality of state and action spaces, we propose DDMAC-CTDE, a Deep Decentralized Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (DDMAC) reinforcement learning architecture with Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE). To demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework, we also develop a new comprehensive benchmark environment representing an existing transportation network in Virginia, U.S., with heterogeneous pavement and bridge assets undergoing nonstationary degradation. This environment incorporates multiple practical constraints related to budget limits, performance guidelines, traffic delays, and risk considerations. On this benchmark, DDMAC-CTDE consistently outperforms standard transportation management baselines, producing better policies. Together, the proposed framework and benchmark provide (i) a scalable, constraint-aware methodology, and (ii) a realistic, rigorous testbed for comprehensive evaluation of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for transportation infrastructure management.</p></details> |  |
| **[GradAlign: Gradient-Aligned Data Selection for LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21492v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central post-training paradigm for large language models (LLMs), but its performance is highly sensitive to the quality of training problems. This sensitivity stems from the non-stationarity of RL: rollouts are generated by an evolving policy, and learning is shaped by exploration and reward feedback, unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with fixed trajectories. As a result, prior work often relies on manual curation or simple heuristic filters (e.g., accuracy), which can admit incorrect or low-utility problems. We propose GradAlign, a gradient-aligned data selection method for LLM reinforcement learning that uses a small, trusted validation set to prioritize training problems whose policy gradients align with validation gradients, yielding an adaptive curriculum. We evaluate GradAlign across three challenging data regimes: unreliable reward signals, distribution imbalance, and low-utility training corpus, showing that GradAlign consistently outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the importance of directional gradient signals in navigating non-stationary policy optimization and yielding more stable training and improved final performance. We release our implementation at https://github.com/StigLidu/GradAlign</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages. Preliminary work</p></details> |

For example, RLVR training with GRPO improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B by 21.4 percentage points using randomly assigned rewards, nearly matching the 29.1-point gain from ground-truth rewards. To explain this counterintuitive observation, we show that GRPO exhibits a clipping bias from the clip term, which can amplify high-prior behaviors learned during pretraining even without informative rewards. As a case study, we identify one such behavior in Qwen2.5-Math models, which we call code reasoning -- reasoning in code without actual code execution; code-reasoning frequency increases from 65 percent to over 90 percent with spurious rewards. However, the presence of such amplifiable behaviors is highly model-dependent. In practice, spurious rewards that are effective for Qwen models often fail to produce gains for other model families, such as Llama3 or OLMo2. Our results highlight the importance of validating RL methods across diverse models rather than relying on a single de facto choice: large gains can arise on Qwen models even from random rewards that do not reflect genuine capability improvements.</p></details> |  |

Real websites are non-stationary and diverse, making artificial or small-scale task sets insufficient for robust policy learning. WebGym contains nearly 300,000 tasks with rubric-based evaluations across diverse, real-world websites and difficulty levels. We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents. Our system achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup compared to naive implementations. Second, we scale the task set breadth, depth, and size, which results in continued performance improvement. Fine-tuning a strong base vision-language model, Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct, on WebGym results in an improvement in success rate on an out-of-distribution test set from 26.2% to 42.9%, significantly outperforming agents based on proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking that achieve 27.1% and 29.8%, respectively. This improvement is substantial because our test set consists only of tasks on websites never seen during training, unlike many other prior works on training visual web agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added link to tasks on HF</p></details> |

However, progress remains limited by the difficulty of simulating complex contact dynamics and multisensory signals, especially tactile feedback. In this work, we propose \ours, a sim-to-real framework that addresses these limitations and demonstrates its effectiveness on nut-bolt fastening and screwdriving with multi-fingered hands. The framework has three stages. First, we train reinforcement learning policies in simulation using simplified object models that lead to the emergence of correct finger gaits. We then use the learned policy as a skill primitive within a teleoperation system to collect real-world demonstrations that contain tactile and proprioceptive information. Finally, we train a behavior cloning policy that incorporates tactile sensing and show that it generalizes to nuts and screwdrivers with diverse geometries. Experiments across both tasks show high task progress ratios compared to direct sim-to-real transfer and robust performance even on unseen object shapes and under external perturbations.

| **[Synergizing Understanding and Generation with Interleaved Analyzing-Drafting Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21435v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Vision-Language Models (UVLMs) aim to advance multimodal learning by supporting both understanding and generation within a single framework. However, existing approaches largely focus on architectural unification while overlooking the need for explicit interaction between the two capabilities during task solving. As a result, current models treat understanding and generation as parallel skills rather than synergistic processes. To achieve real synergy, we introduce the interleaved Analyzing-Drafting problem-solving loop (AD-Loop), a new think paradigm that dynamically alternates between analytic and drafting operations. By interleaving textual thoughts with visual thoughts, AD-Loop enables models to iteratively refine both comprehension and outputs, fostering genuine synergy. To train this mechanism, we design a two-stage strategy: supervised learning on interleaved thought data to initialize alternation, followed by reinforcement learning to promote adaptive and autonomous control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AD-Loop consistently improves performance across standard benchmarks for both understanding and generation, with strong transferability to various UVLMs architectures. Visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of implicit visual thoughts. These results highlight AD-Loop as a principled and broadly applicable strategy for synergizing comprehension and creation.

However, in off-policy training pipelines, these methods often exhibit unstable optimization dynamics and are prone to performance collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two fundamental sources of instability in this setting: (1)~a granularity mismatch between token-level policy optimization and turn-structured interactions, and (2) high-variance and unreliable gradient updates induced by off-policy importance sampling and inaccurate advantage estimation. To address these challenges, we propose SORL, \underline{S}tabilizing \underline{O}ff-Policy \underline{R}einforcement \underline{L}earning for Long-Horizon Agent Training. SORL introduces principled mechanisms that align policy optimization with the structure of multi-turn interactions and adaptively suppress unreliable off-policy updates, yielding more conservative and robust learning dynamics. Within this framework, we instantiate two stabilized algorithms: SO-PPO and SO-GRPO. Both algorithms are designed to mitigate gradient variance and prevent optimization collapse without requiring careful early stopping or heuristic tuning. We evaluate SO-PPO and SO-GRPO on a range of multi-turn search benchmarks, including general question answering, multi-hop question answering, and medical multiple-choice QA tasks. Experimental results show that both methods consistently prevent training instabilities and performance collapses observed in standard PPO and GRPO, maintain lower clipping ratios and more stable optimization trajectories, and achieve superior or comparable task performance. These results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides a practical, scalable, and general framework for stabilizing reinforcement learning in multi-turn LLM agent training.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Structural Non-Preservation of Epistemic Behaviour under Policy Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21424v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) agents under partial observability often condition actions on internally accumulated information such as memory or inferred latent context. We formalise such information-conditioned interaction patterns as behavioural dependency: variation in action selection with respect to internal information under fixed observations. This induces a probe-relative notion of $ε$-behavioural equivalence and a within-policy behavioural distance that quantifies probe sensitivity. We establish three structural results. First, the set of policies exhibiting non-trivial behavioural dependency is not closed under convex aggregation. Second, behavioural distance contracts under convex combination. Third, we prove a sufficient local condition under which gradient ascent on a skewed mixture objective decreases behavioural distance when a dominant-mode gradient aligns with the direction of steepest contraction. Minimal bandit and partially observable gridworld experiments provide controlled witnesses of these mechanisms. In the examined settings, behavioural distance decreases under convex aggregation and under continued optimisation with skewed latent priors, and in these experiments it precedes degradation under latent prior shift. These results identify structural conditions under which probe-conditioned behavioural separation is not preserved under common policy transformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Overconfident Errors Need Stronger Correction: Asymmetric Confidence Penalties for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21420v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become the leading paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard RLVR algorithms suffer from a well-documented pathology: while they improve Pass@1 accuracy through sharpened sampling, they simultaneously narrow the model's reasoning boundary and reduce generation diversity. We identify a root cause that existing methods overlook: the uniform penalization of errors. Current approaches -- whether data-filtering methods that select prompts by difficulty, or advantage normalization schemes -- treat all incorrect rollouts within a group identically. We show that this uniformity allows overconfident errors (incorrect reasoning paths that the RL process has spuriously reinforced) to persist and monopolize probability mass, ultimately suppressing valid exploratory trajectories. To address this, we propose the Asymmetric Confidence-aware Error Penalty (ACE). ACE introduces a per-rollout confidence shift metric, c_i = log(pi_theta(y_i|x) / pi_ref(y_i|x)), to dynamically modulate negative advantages. Theoretically, we demonstrate that ACE's gradient can be decomposed into the gradient of a selective regularizer restricted to overconfident errors, plus a well-characterized residual that partially moderates the regularizer's strength. We conduct extensive experiments fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen3-8B-Base, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the DAPO-Math-17K dataset using GRPO and DAPO within the VERL framework. Evaluated on MATH-500 and AIME 2025, ACE composes seamlessly with existing methods and consistently improves the full Pass@k spectrum across all three model families and benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Semantic RL: Tackling the Problem of Dynamic Action Space for RL-based Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09167v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender Systems (RS) are fundamental to modern online services. While most existing approaches optimize for short-term engagement, recent work has begun to explore reinforcement learning (RL) to model long-term user value. However, these efforts face significant challenges due to the vast, dynamic action spaces inherent in RS, which hinder stable policy learning. To resolve this bottleneck, we introduce Hierarchical Semantic RL (HSRL), which reframes RL-based recommendation over a fixed Semantic Action Space (SAS). HSRL encodes items as Semantic IDs (SIDs) for policy learning, and maps SIDs back to their original items via a fixed lookup during execution. To align decision-making with SID generation, the Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN) operates in a coarse-to-fine manner, employing hierarchical residual state modeling to refine each level's context from the previous level's residual, thereby reducing representation-decision mismatch. In parallel, a Multi-level Critic (MLC) provides token-level value estimates, enabling fine-grained credit assignment. Across public benchmarks and a large-scale production dataset from a leading short-video advertising platform, HSRL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In online deployment over a 7-day A/B testing, it delivers an 18.421% ADVV lift and a 1.251% increase in Revenue, supporting HSRL as a scalable paradigm for RL-based recommendation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present EExAPP, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based xApp for 5G Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) that jointly optimizes radio unit (RU) sleep scheduling and distributed unit (DU) resource slicing. EExAPP uses a dual-actor-dual-critic Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) architecture, with dedicated actor-critic pairs targeting energy efficiency and quality-of-service (QoS) compliance. A transformer-based encoder enables scalable handling of variable user equipment (UE) populations by encoding all-UE observations into fixed-dimensional representations. To coordinate the two optimization objectives, a bipartite Graph Attention Network (GAT) is used to modulate actor updates based on both critic outputs, enabling adaptive trade-offs between power savings and QoS. We have implemented EExAPP and deployed it on a real-world 5G O-RAN testbed with live traffic, commercial RU and smartphones. Extensive over-the-air experiments and ablation studies confirm that EExAPP significantly outperforms existing methods in reducing the energy consumption of RU while maintaining QoS.

However, these LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that disguise harmful intent through indirect or deceptive phrasing. Using causal intervention, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from shallow alignment mechanisms that lack deep reasoning, often rejecting harmful prompts without truly understanding why they are harmful. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose enhancing alignment through reasoning-aware post-training. We construct and release a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning dataset that includes both utility-oriented and safety-critical prompts with step-by-step rationales. Fine-tuning on this dataset encourages models to produce principled refusals grounded in reasoning, outperforming standard SFT baselines. Furthermore, inspired by failure patterns in CoT fine-tuning, we introduce Alignment-Weighted DPO, which targets the most problematic parts of an output by assigning different preference weights to the reasoning and final-answer segments. This produces finer-grained, targeted updates than vanilla DPO and improves robustness to diverse jailbreak strategies. Extensive experiments across multiple safety and utility benchmarks show that our method consistently improves alignment robustness while maintaining overall model utility.</p></details> |  |

We propose the Single-Step Completion Policy (SSCP), a generative policy trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples, enabling accurate, one-shot action generation. In an off-policy actor-critic framework, SSCP combines the expressiveness of generative models with the training and inference efficiency of unimodal policies, without requiring long backpropagation chains. Our method scales effectively to offline, offline-to-online, and online RL settings, offering substantial gains in speed and adaptability over diffusion-based baselines. We further extend SSCP to goal-conditioned RL, enabling flat policies to exploit subgoal structures without explicit hierarchical inference. SSCP achieves strong results across standard offline RL and behavior cloning benchmarks, positioning it as a versatile, expressive, and efficient framework for deep RL and sequential decision-making.

Despite this progress, a gap remains between model capability and the demands of real-world RTL design, including syntax errors, functional hallucinations, and weak alignment to designer intent. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a promising approach to bridge this gap, as hardware provides executable and formally checkable signals that can be used to further align model outputs with design intent. However, in long, structured RTL code sequences, not all tokens contribute equally to functional correctness, and naïvely spreading gradients across all tokens dilutes learning signals. A key insight from our entropy analysis in RTL generation is that only a small fraction of tokens (e.g., always, if, assign, posedge) exhibit high uncertainty and largely influence control flow and module structure. To address these challenges, we present EARL, an Entropy-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework for Verilog generation. EARL performs policy optimization using verifiable reward signals and introduces entropy-guided selective updates that gate policy gradients to high-entropy tokens. This approach preserves training stability and concentrates gradient updates on functionally important regions of code. Our experiments on VerilogEval and RTLLM show that EARL improves functional pass rates over prior LLM baselines by up to 14.7%, while reducing unnecessary updates and improving training stability. These results indicate that focusing RL on critical, high-uncertainty tokens enables more reliable and targeted policy improvement for structured RTL code generation.</p></details> | Accepted to DAC 2026 |

Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a common approach for injecting such agentic capabilities, but typically under tightly controlled training setups. It often depends on carefully constructed task-solution pairs and substantial human supervision, which creates a fundamental obstacle to open-ended self-evolution toward superintelligent systems. In this paper, we propose Tool-R0 framework for training general purpose tool-calling agents from scratch with self-play RL, under a zero-data assumption. Initialized from the same base LLM, Tool-R0 co-evolves a Generator and a Solver with complementary rewards: one proposes targeted challenging tasks at the other's competence frontier and the other learns to solve them with real-world tool calls. This creates a self-evolving cycle that requires no pre-existing tasks or datasets. Evaluation on different tool-use benchmarks show that Tool-R0 yields 92.5 relative improvement over the base model and surpasses fully supervised tool-calling baselines under the same setting. Our work further provides empirical insights into self-play LLM agents by analyzing co-evolution, curriculum dynamics, and scaling behavior.</p></details> |  |

Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next iteration. Empirically, RSA delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA with Gemini 3 Flash attains performance near the top of the ARC-AGI-2 public leaderboard. RSA also enables Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), outperforming purely parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA.

However, the efficient training of collective robots using multi-agent RL and the transfer of learned policies to real-world applications remain open research questions. In this work, we first develop a comprehensive robotic system, including simulation, distributed learning framework, and physical robot components. We then propose and evaluate reinforcement learning techniques designed for efficient training of cooperative and competitive policies on this platform. To address the challenges of multi-agent sim-to-real transfer, we introduce Out of Distribution State Initialization (OODSI) to mitigate the impact of the sim-to-real gap. In the experiments, OODSI improves the Sim2Real performance by 20%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments with a multi-robot car competitive game and a cooperative task in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2026), Vienna, Austria</p></details> |

While recent LLM-based agents show promise, current prompt-based agents for MLE suffer from behavioral stagnation due to frozen parameters. Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a remedy, applying it to MLE is hindered by prohibitive execution latency and inefficient data selection. Recognizing these challenges, we propose AceGRPO with two core components: (1) Evolving Data Buffer that continuously repurposes execution traces into reusable training tasks, and (2) Adaptive Sampling guided by a Learnability Potential function, which dynamically prioritizes tasks at the agent's learning frontier to maximize learning efficiency. Leveraging AceGRPO, our trained Ace-30B model achieves a 100% valid submission rate on MLE-Bench-Lite, approaches the performance of proprietary frontier models, and outperforms larger open-source baselines (e.g., DeepSeek-V3.2), demonstrating robust capability for sustained iterative optimization.

| **[SimToolReal: An Object-Centric Policy for Zero-Shot Dexterous Tool Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16863v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to manipulate tools significantly expands the set of tasks a robot can perform. Yet, tool manipulation represents a challenging class of dexterity, requiring grasping thin objects, in-hand object rotations, and forceful interactions. Since collecting teleoperation data for these behaviors is challenging, sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising alternative. However, prior approaches typically require substantial engineering effort to model objects and tune reward functions for each task. In this work, we propose SimToolReal, taking a step towards generalizing sim-to-real RL policies for tool manipulation. Instead of focusing on a single object and task, we procedurally generate a large variety of tool-like object primitives in simulation and train a single RL policy with the universal goal of manipulating each object to random goal poses. This approach enables SimToolReal to perform general dexterous tool manipulation at test-time without any object or task-specific training. We demonstrate that SimToolReal outperforms prior retargeting and fixed-grasp methods by 37% while matching the performance of specialist RL policies trained on specific target objects and tasks. Finally, we show that SimToolReal generalizes across a diverse set of everyday tools, achieving strong zero-shot performance over 120 real-world rollouts spanning 24 tasks, 12 object instances, and 6 tool categories.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically address dynamics mismatch either globally over the state space or via pointwise data filtering; these approaches can miss localized cross-domain similarities or incur high computational cost. We propose Localized Dynamics-Aware Domain Adaptation (LoDADA), which exploits localized dynamics mismatch to better reuse source data. LoDADA clusters transitions from source and target datasets and estimates cluster-level dynamics discrepancy via domain discrimination. Source transitions from clusters with small discrepancy are retained, while those from clusters with large discrepancy are filtered out. This yields a fine-grained and scalable data selection strategy that avoids overly coarse global assumptions and expensive per-sample filtering. We provide theoretical insights and extensive experiments across environments with diverse global and local dynamics shifts. Results show that LoDADA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art off-dynamics offline RL methods by better leveraging localized distribution mismatch.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 9 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Safe Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Engine Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16613v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a toolchain for applying Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, in safety-critical real-world environments. As an exemplary application, transient load control is demonstrated on a single-cylinder internal combustion engine testbench in Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) mode, that offers high thermal efficiency and low emissions. However, HCCI poses challenges for traditional control methods due to its nonlinear, autoregressive, and stochastic nature. RL provides a viable solution, however, safety concerns, such as excessive pressure rise rates, must be addressed when applying to HCCI. A single unsuitable control input can severely damage the engine or cause misfiring and shut down. Additionally, operating limits are not known a priori and must be determined experimentally. To mitigate these risks, real-time safety monitoring based on the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is implemented, enabling safe interaction with the testbench. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated as the RL agent learns a control policy through interaction with the testbench. A root mean square error of 0.1374 bar is achieved for the indicated mean effective pressure, comparable to neural network-based controllers from the literature. The toolchain's flexibility is further demonstrated by adapting the agent's policy to increase ethanol energy shares, promoting renewable fuel use while maintaining safety. This RL approach addresses the longstanding challenge of applying RL to safety-critical real-world environments. The developed toolchain, with its adaptability and safety mechanisms, paves the way for future applicability of RL in engine testbenches and other safety-critical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do We Need Adam? Surprisingly Strong and Sparse Reinforcement Learning with SGD in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07729v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly RL from verifiable reward (RLVR), has become a crucial phase of training large language models (LLMs) and a key focus of current scaling efforts. However, optimization practices in RL largely follow those of next-token prediction stages (e.g., pretraining and supervised fine-tuning), despite fundamental differences between RL and these stages highlighted by recent work. One such practice is the use of the AdamW optimizer, which is widely adopted for training large-scale transformers despite its high memory overhead. Our analysis shows that both momentum and adaptive learning rates in AdamW are less influential in RL than in SFT, leading us to hypothesize that RL benefits less from Adam-style per-parameter adaptive learning rates and momentum. Confirming this hypothesis, our experiments demonstrate that the substantially more memory-efficient SGD, which is known to perform poorly in supervised learning of large-scale transformers, matches or even outperforms AdamW in RL for LLMs. Remarkably, full fine-tuning with SGD updates fewer than 0.02% of model parameters without any sparsity-promoting regularization, more than 1000 times fewer than AdamW. Our analysis offers potential reasons for this update sparsity. These findings provide new insights into the optimization dynamics of RL in LLMs and show that RL can be substantially more parameter-efficient than previously recognized.</p></details> |  |

Existing configuration-based or intent-driven Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches usually rely on static mappings and SLA conversions. The current literature does not integrate natural language understanding with coordinated decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose an Agentic AI framework for 6G RAN slicing, driven by a super agent built using Hierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM) controllers and a Large Language Model (LLM). The super agent interprets operator intents and translates them into actionable goals using the LLM, which are used by HDM to coordinate inter-slice, intra-slice, and self-healing agents. Compared to transformer-based and reward-driven baselines, the proposed Agentic AI framework demonstrates consistent improvements across key performance indicators, including higher throughput, improved cell-edge performance, and reduced latency across different slices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Networking Letters (Author's copy).

However, current work typically relies on prompt design or fine-tuning strategies applied to vanilla LLMs, which often leads to limited effectiveness or suboptimal performance in complex agent-related environments. Although LLM optimization techniques can improve model performance across many general tasks, they lack specialized optimization towards critical agent functionalities such as long-term planning, dynamic environmental interaction, and complex decision-making. Although numerous recent studies have explored various strategies to optimize LLM-based agents for complex agent tasks, a systematic review summarizing and comparing these methods from a holistic perspective is still lacking. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of LLM-based agent optimization approaches, categorizing them into parameter-driven and parameter-free methods. We first focus on parameter-driven optimization, covering fine-tuning-based optimization, reinforcement learning-based optimization, and hybrid strategies, analyzing key aspects such as trajectory data construction, fine-tuning techniques, reward function design, and optimization algorithms. Additionally, we briefly discuss parameter-free strategies that optimize agent behavior through prompt engineering and external knowledge retrieval. Finally, we summarize the datasets and benchmarks used for evaluation and tuning, review key applications of LLM-based agents, and discuss major challenges and promising future directions.

In this report, we present UI-Venus-1.5, a unified, end-to-end GUI Agent designed for robust real-world applications. The proposed model family comprises two dense variants (2B and 8B) and one mixture-of-experts variant (30B-A3B) to meet various downstream application scenarios. Compared to our previous version, UI-Venus-1.5 introduces three key technical advances: (1) a comprehensive Mid-Training stage leveraging 10 billion tokens across 30+ datasets to establish foundational GUI semantics; (2) Online Reinforcement Learning with full-trajectory rollouts, aligning training objectives with long-horizon, dynamic navigation in large-scale environments; and (3) a single unified GUI Agent constructed via Model Merging, which synthesizes domain-specific models (grounding, web, and mobile) into one cohesive checkpoint. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UI-Venus-1.5 establishes new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot-Pro (69.6%), VenusBench-GD (75.0%), and AndroidWorld (77.6%), significantly outperforming previous strong baselines. In addition, UI-Venus-1.5 demonstrates robust navigation capabilities across a variety of Chinese mobile apps, effectively executing user instructions in real-world scenarios.

A fundamental challenge lies in optimally selecting the operating modes of access points (APs) to jointly maximize the received energy and satisfy spectral efficiency (SE) quality-of-service constraints. Practical system impairments, including a non-linear harvested energy model, pilot contamination (PC), channel estimation errors, and reliance on long-term statistical channel state information (CSI), are considered. We derive closed-form expressions for both the achievable SE and the average sum harvested energy (sum-HE). A mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the SIM phase shifts, APs mode selection, and power allocation to maximize average sum-HE under SE and average harvested energy constraints. To solve this problem, we propose a centralized training, decentralized execution (CTDE) framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which efficiently handles high-dimensional decision spaces. A Markovian environment and a normalized joint reward function are introduced to enhance the training stability across on-policy and off-policy DRL algorithms. Additionally, we provide a two-phase convex-based solution as a theoretical robust performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-based CTDE framework achieves SWIPT performance comparable to convexification-based solution, while significantly outperforming baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE TWC, Feb. 2026</p></details> |
| **[Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10167v4)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[PMG: Parameterized Motion Generator for Human-like Locomotion Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12656v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in data-driven reinforcement learning and motion tracking have substantially improved humanoid locomotion, yet critical practical challenges remain. In particular, while low-level motion tracking and trajectory-following controllers are mature, whole-body reference-guided methods are difficult to adapt to higher-level command interfaces and diverse task contexts: they require large, high-quality datasets, are brittle across speed and pose regimes, and are sensitive to robot-specific calibration. To address these limitations, we propose the Parameterized Motion Generator (PMG), a real-time motion generator grounded in an analysis of human motion structure that synthesizes reference trajectories using only a compact set of parameterized motion data together with high-dimensional control commands. Combined with an imitation-learning pipeline and an optimization-based sim-to-real motor parameter identification module, we validate the complete approach on our humanoid prototype ZERITH Z1 and show that, within a single integrated system, PMG produces natural, human-like locomotion, responds precisely to high-dimensional control inputs-including VR-based teleoperation-and enables efficient, verifiable sim-to-real transfer. Together, these results establish a practical, experimentally validated pathway toward natural and deployable humanoid control.

Recent approaches incorporate large language models (LLMs) to enrich visual representations with semantic embeddings derived from class names. However, they overlook progressive and adaptive alignment between vision and language from low-level to high-level semantics, resulting in limited semantic gains. To address these challenges, we propose Dual-level Vision-Language Alignment with Reinforcement Learning gating (DVLA-RL), which consists of Dual-level Semantic Construction (DSC) and RL-gated Attention (RLA). Specifically, DSC conditions LLMs on both class names and support samples to generate discriminative attributes, progressively selects the most relevant ones, and then synthesizes them into coherent class descriptions. This process provides complementary low-level attributes and high-level descriptions, enabling both fine-grained grounding and holistic class understanding. To dynamically integrate dual-level semantics along with the visual network layers, RLA formulates cross-modal fusion as a sequential decision process. A lightweight policy trained with episodic REINFORCE adaptively adjusts the contributions of self-attention and cross-attention to integrate textual and visual tokens. As a result, shallow layers refine local attributes and deep layers emphasize global semantics, enabling more precise cross-modal alignment. This achieves class-specific discrimination and generalized representations with merely a few support samples. DVLA-RL achieves new state-of-the-art performance across nine benchmarks in three diverse FSL scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Existing methods, employ a variety of open-loop and closed-loop approaches but lack an end-to-end solution that can grasp several objects while taking into account the downstream task's constraints. Our proposed approach employs reinforcement learning to enhance task-oriented grasping, prioritizing the post-grasp intention of the agent. We extract human grasp preferences from the ContactPose dataset, and train a hand synergy model based on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to imitate the participant's grasping actions. Based on this data, we train an agent able to grasp multiple objects while taking into account distinct post-grasp intentions that are task-specific. By combining data-driven insights from human grasping behavior with learning by exploration provided by reinforcement learning, we can develop humanoid robots capable of context-aware manipulation actions, facilitating collaboration in human-centered environments.</p></details> |  |

We propose LongVideo-R1, an active, reasoning-equipped multimodal large language model (MLLM) agent designed for efficient video context navigation, avoiding the redundancy of exhaustive search. At the core of LongVideo-R1 lies a reasoning module that leverages high-level visual cues to infer the most informative video clip for subsequent processing. During inference, the agent initiates traversal from top-level visual summaries and iteratively refines its focus, immediately halting the exploration process upon acquiring sufficient knowledge to answer the query. To facilitate training, we first extract hierarchical video captions from CGBench, a video corpus with grounding annotations, and guide GPT-5 to generate 33K high-quality chain-of-thought-with-tool trajectories. The LongVideo-R1 agent is fine-tuned upon the Qwen-3-8B model through a two-stage paradigm: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL), where RL employs a specifically designed reward function to maximize selective and efficient clip navigation. Experiments on multiple long video benchmarks validate the effectiveness of name, which enjoys superior tradeoff between QA accuracy and efficiency.

However, in practical applications, balancing exploration, learning stability, and sample efficiency remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods such as Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) address these issues by incorporating entropy or relative entropy regularization, but often face problems of instability and low sample efficiency. In this paper, we propose the Conservative Soft Actor-Critic (CSAC) algorithm, which seamlessly integrates entropy and relative entropy regularization within the AC framework. CSAC improves exploration through entropy regularization while avoiding overly aggressive policy updates with the use of relative entropy regularization. Evaluations on benchmark tasks and real-world robotic simulations demonstrate that CSAC offers significant improvements in stability and efficiency over existing methods. These findings suggest that CSAC provides strong robustness and application potential in control tasks under dynamic environments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

Assuming independent samples, we make three theoretical contributions that improve upon the current state-of-the-art results: (i) we establish refined high-dimensional Berry-Esseen bounds over the class of convex sets, achieving faster rates than the best known results, and (ii) we propose and analyze a novel, computationally efficient online plug-in estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix; (iii) we derive sharper high probability convergence guarantees that depend explicitly on the asymptotic variance and hold under weaker conditions than those adopted in the literature. These results enable the construction of confidence regions and simultaneous confidence intervals for the linear parameters of the value function approximation, with guaranteed finite-sample coverage. We demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

This paradigm is often impractical for specialized robots where data is scarce and creates an inefficient, theoretically suboptimal training pipeline. To overcome this, we introduce PegasusFlow, a hierarchical rolling-denoising framework that enables direct and parallel sampling of trajectory score gradients from environmental interaction, completely bypassing the need for expert data. Our core innovation is a novel sampling algorithm, Weighted Basis Function Optimization (WBFO), which leverages spline basis representations to achieve superior sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to traditional methods like MPPI. The framework is embedded within a scalable, asynchronous parallel simulation architecture that supports massively parallel rollouts for efficient data collection. Extensive experiments on trajectory optimization and robotic navigation tasks demonstrate that our approach, particularly Action-Value WBFO (AVWBFO) combined with a reinforcement learning warm-start, significantly outperforms baselines. In a challenging barrier-crossing task, our method achieved a 100% success rate and was 18% faster than the next-best method, validating its effectiveness for complex terrain locomotion planning. https://masteryip.github.io/pegasusflow.github.io/</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

We argue that this inefficiency stems from the standard practice of optimizing policies directly in the high-dimensional and highly redundant parameter space $Θ$. This challenge is greatly compounded in multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approach that compresses the policy parameter space $Θ$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model $g:\mathcal{Z}\toΘ$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space $\mathcal{Z}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026 camera ready version.

While RL agents require extensive self-play games to extract useful signals, humans often need only a few games, improving rapidly by repeatedly revisiting states where mistakes occurred. This idea, known as search control, aims to restart from valuable states rather than always from the initial state. In AlphaZero, prior work Go-Exploit applies this idea by sampling past states from self-play or search trees, but it treats all states equally, regardless of their learning potential. We propose Regret-Guided Search Control (RGSC), which extends AlphaZero with a regret network that learns to identify high-regret states, where the agent's evaluation diverges most from the actual outcome. These states are collected from both self-play trajectories and MCTS nodes, stored in a prioritized regret buffer, and reused as new starting positions. Across 9x9 Go, 10x10 Othello, and 11x11 Hex, RGSC outperforms AlphaZero and Go-Exploit by an average of 77 and 89 Elo, respectively. When training on a well-trained 9x9 Go model, RGSC further improves the win rate against KataGo from 69.3% to 78.2%, while both baselines show no improvement. These results demonstrate that RGSC provides an effective mechanism for search control, improving both efficiency and robustness of AlphaZero training.

Genuinely solving such tasks requires Dec-POMDP reasoning, where agents use history to infer hidden states and coordinate based on local information. Yet it remains unclear whether popular benchmarks actually demand this reasoning or permit success via simpler strategies. We introduce a diagnostic suite combining statistically grounded performance comparisons and information-theoretic probes to audit the behavioural complexity of baseline policies (IPPO and MAPPO) across 37 scenarios spanning MPE, SMAX, Overcooked, Hanabi, and MaBrax. Our diagnostics reveal that success on these benchmarks rarely requires genuine Dec-POMDP reasoning. Reactive policies match the performance of memory-based agents in over half the scenarios, and emergent coordination frequently relies on brittle, synchronous action coupling rather than robust temporal influence. These findings suggest that some widely used benchmarks may not adequately test core Dec-POMDP assumptions under current training paradigms, potentially leading to over-optimistic assessments of progress. We release our diagnostic tooling to support more rigorous environment design and evaluation in cooperative MARL.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the 25th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 2026)</p></details> |

Building upon the agentic, reasoning, and coding (ARC) capabilities of its predecessor, GLM-5 adopts DSA to significantly reduce training and inference costs while maintaining long-context fidelity. To advance model alignment and autonomy, we implement a new asynchronous reinforcement learning infrastructure that drastically improves post-training efficiency by decoupling generation from training. Furthermore, we propose novel asynchronous agent RL algorithms that further improve RL quality, enabling the model to learn from complex, long-horizon interactions more effectively. Through these innovations, GLM-5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on major open benchmarks. Most critically, GLM-5 demonstrates unprecedented capability in real-world coding tasks, surpassing previous baselines in handling end-to-end software engineering challenges.

| **[Overton Pluralistic Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20759v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing alignment paradigms remain limited in capturing the pluralistic nature of human values. Overton Pluralism addresses this gap by generating responses with diverse perspectives from a single query. This paper introduces OP-GRPO (Overton Pluralistic Group Relative Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework for implicit Overton Pluralism that enables a single large language model to produce pluralistic responses without explicit prompting or modular orchestration. Our workflow consists of two main steps. First, similarity estimator training fine-tunes a Sentence Transformer for Overton Pluralism tasks to provide more accurate coverage evaluation of generated responses. Second, OP-GRPO training incorporates this similarity estimator into a dual-reward system designed to ensure both broad coverage of genuine human perspectives and the uniqueness of each perspective, thereby promoting diversity. Empirical results demonstrate a "small models, big perspective coverage" effect. The trained Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model surpasses a 20B GPT-OSS baseline with a 37.4 percent relative accuracy gain on a Natural Language Inference benchmark, and also outperforms a modular architecture baseline with a 19.1 percent relative improvement. Additional evaluations using GPT-4.1 as a large language model judge further confirm the robustness of the approach.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figures |
| **[One-Step Flow Q-Learning: Addressing the Diffusion Policy Bottleneck in Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13904v3)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) has established diffusion policies as a high-performing paradigm for offline reinforcement learning, but its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation renders both training and inference slow and fragile. Existing efforts to accelerate DQL toward one-step denoising typically rely on auxiliary modules or policy distillation, sacrificing either simplicity or performance. It remains unclear whether a one-step policy can be trained directly without such trade-offs. To this end, we introduce One-Step Flow Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables effective one-step action generation during both training and inference, without auxiliary modules or distillation. OFQL reformulates the DQL policy within the Flow Matching (FM) paradigm but departs from conventional FM by learning an average velocity field that directly supports accurate one-step action generation. This design removes the need for multi-step denoising and backpropagation-through-time updates, resulting in substantially faster and more robust learning. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that OFQL, despite generating actions in a single step, not only significantly reduces computation during both training and inference but also outperforms multi-step DQL by a large margin. Furthermore, OFQL surpasses all other baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance in D4RL.</p></details> | 10 pages, ICLR2026 |

We introduce PyVision-RL, a reinforcement learning framework for open-weight multimodal models that stabilizes training and sustains interaction. Our approach combines an oversampling-filtering-ranking rollout strategy with an accumulative tool reward to prevent collapse and encourage multi-turn tool use. Using a unified training pipeline, we develop PyVision-Image and PyVision-Video for image and video understanding. For video reasoning, PyVision-Video employs on-demand context construction, selectively sampling task-relevant frames during reasoning to significantly reduce visual token usage. Experiments show strong performance and improved efficiency, demonstrating that sustained interaction and on-demand visual processing are critical for scalable multimodal agents.</p></details> | preprint |

However, the complex interplay of multiple uncertainty sources in real environments poses significant challenges for interpretable risk assessment and robust decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose Fuz-RL, a fuzzy measure-guided robust framework for safe RL. Specifically, our framework develops a novel fuzzy Bellman operator for estimating robust value functions using Choquet integrals. Theoretically, we prove that solving the Fuz-RL problem (in Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) form) is equivalent to solving distributionally robust safe RL problems (in robust CMDP form), effectively avoiding min-max optimization. Empirical analyses on safe-control-gym and safety-gymnasium scenarios demonstrate that Fuz-RL effectively integrates with existing safe RL baselines in a model-free manner, significantly improving both safety and control performance under various types of uncertainties in observation, action, and dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Multiple Objectives in Urban Traffic Control with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20728v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward design has been one of the central challenges for real world reinforcement learning (RL) deployment, especially in settings with multiple objectives. Preference-based RL offers an appealing alternative by learning from human preferences over pairs of behavioural outcomes. More recently, RL from AI feedback (RLAIF) has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can generate preference labels at scale, mitigating the reliance on human annotators. However, existing RLAIF work typically focuses only on single-objective tasks, leaving the open question of how RLAIF handles systems that involve multiple objectives. In such systems trade-offs among conflicting objectives are difficult to specify, and policies risk collapsing into optimizing for a dominant goal. In this paper, we explore the extension of the RLAIF paradigm to multi-objective self-adaptive systems. We show that multi-objective RLAIF can produce policies that yield balanced trade-offs reflecting different user priorities without laborious reward engineering. We argue that integrating RLAIF into multi-objective RL offers a scalable path toward user-aligned policy learning in domains with inherently conflicting objectives.</p></details> |  |

Firstly, we present an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) method to solve the problem. We then integrate deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques into the BCD method and propose the DRL-based BCD algorithm. This approach combines the data-driven learning capability of machine learning techniques with the navigational and decision-making characteristics of the optimization-theoretic-based BCD method. This combination significantly improves the algorithm's performance by reducing its sensitivity to initial points and mitigating the risk of entrapment in local optima. The primary advantages of the proposed DRL-based BCD algorithm lie in its ability to adhere to the constraints of the WSRM problem and significantly enhance accuracy, potentially achieving the exact optimal solution. Moreover, unlike many pure machine-learning approaches, the DRL-based BCD algorithm capitalizes on the underlying theoretical analysis of the WSRM problem's structure. This enables it to be easily trained and computationally efficient while maintaining a level of interpretability. Through numerical experiments, the DRL-based BCD algorithm demonstrates substantial advantages in effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and interpretability for maximizing sum rates, which also provides valuable potential for designing resource-constrained AI-native wireless optimization strategies in next-generation wireless networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications in 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce Batch Adaptation Policy Optimization (BAPO), an off-policy RLVR framework to improve the data efficiency in large language models post-training. It dynamically selects training batches by re-evaluating historically difficult samples and reusing high-quality ones, while holding a lower bound guarantee for policy improvement. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that BAPO achieves an average 12.5% improvement over GRPO across mathematics, planning, and visual reasoning tasks. Crucially, BAPO successfully resolves 40.7% of problems that base models consistently fail to solve.</p></details> |  |

Although reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for policy improvement, applying it to real-world VLA fine-tuning faces challenges regarding exploration efficiency, training stability, and sample cost. To address these issues, we propose IG-RFT, a novel Interaction-Guided Reinforced Fine-Tuning system designed for flow-based VLA models. Firstly, to facilitate effective policy optimization, we introduce Interaction-Guided Advantage Weighted Regression (IG-AWR), an RL algorithm that dynamically modulates exploration intensity based on the robot's interaction status. Furthermore, to address the limitations of sparse or task-specific rewards, we design a novel hybrid dense reward function that integrates the trajectory-level reward and the subtask-level reward. Finally, we construct a three-stage RL system comprising SFT, Offline RL, and Human-in-the-Loop RL for fine-tuning VLA models. Extensive real-world experiments on four challenging long-horizon tasks demonstrate that IG-RFT achieves an average success rate of 85.0%, significantly outperforming SFT (18.8%) and standard Offline RL baselines (40.0%). Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of IG-AWR and hybrid reward shaping. In summary, our work establishes and validates a novel reinforced fine-tuning system for VLA models in real-world robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often rely on panel labels or handcrafted heuristics, which limit their applicability to real-world, non-conforming patterns. We present AutoSew, a fully automatic, geometry-based approach for predicting stitch correspondences directly from 2D pattern contours. AutoSew formulates the problem as a graph matching task, leveraging a Graph Neural Network to capture local and global geometric context, and employing a differentiable optimal transport solver to infer stitching relationships-including multi-edge connections. To support this task, we update the GarmentCodeData dataset modifying over 18k patterns with realistic multi-edge annotations, reflecting industrial assembly scenarios. AutoSew achieves 96% F1-score and successfully assembles 73.3% of test garments without error, outperforming existing methods while relying solely on geometric input. Our results demonstrate that geometry alone can robustly guide stitching prediction, enabling scalable garment assembly without manual input.</p></details> | WACV 2026 |

To incorporate protein-structure priors, we represent the backbone as a graph and use a graph neural network (GNN) autodecoder that maps per-image latent variables to 3D displacements of a template conformation. The objective combines a data-discrepancy term based on a differentiable cryo-EM forward model with geometric regularization, and it supports unknown orientations via ellipsoidal support lifting (ESL) pose estimation. On synthetic datasets derived from molecular dynamics trajectories, the proposed GNN achieves higher accuracy compared to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) of comparable size, highlighting the benefits of a geometry-informed inductive bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonstabilizerness Estimation using Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23224v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article proposes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to estimate nonstabilizerness in quantum circuits, measured by the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). Nonstabilizerness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, and efficient SRE estimations are highly beneficial in practical applications. We address the nonstabilizerness estimation problem through three supervised learning formulations starting from easier classification tasks to the more challenging regression task. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN manages to capture meaningful features from the graph-based circuit representation, resulting in robust generalization performances achieved across diverse scenarios. In classification tasks, the GNN is trained on product states and generalizes on circuits evolved under Clifford operations, entangled states, and circuits with higher number of qubits. In the regression task, the GNN significantly improves the SRE estimation on out-of-distribution circuits with higher number of qubits and gate counts compared to previous work, for both unstructured random quantum circuits and structured circuits derived from the transverse-field Ising model. Moreover, the graph representation of quantum circuits naturally integrates hardware-specific information. Simulations on noisy quantum hardware highlight the potential of the proposed GNN to predict the SRE measured on quantum devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[RABot: Reinforcement-Guided Graph Augmentation for Imbalanced and Noisy Social Bot Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21749v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social bot detection is pivotal for safeguarding the integrity of online information ecosystems. Although recent graph neural network (GNN) solutions achieve strong results, they remain hindered by two practical challenges: (i) severe class imbalance arising from the high cost of generating bots, and (ii) topological noise introduced by bots that skillfully mimic human behavior and forge deceptive links. We propose the Reinforcement-guided graph Augmentation social Bot detector (RABot), a multi-granularity graph-augmentation framework that addresses both issues in a unified manner. RABot employs a neighborhood-aware oversampling strategy that linearly interpolates minority-class embeddings within local subgraphs, thereby stabilizing the decision boundary under low-resource regimes. Concurrently, a reinforcement-learning-driven edge-filtering module combines similarity-based edge features with adaptive threshold optimization to excise spurious interactions during message passing, yielding a cleaner topology. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks and four GNN backbones demonstrate that RABot consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, since its augmentation and filtering modules are orthogonal to the underlying architecture, RABot can be seamlessly integrated into existing GNN pipelines to boost performance with minimal overhead.</p></details> |  |

No Problem: Synthesizing Security Graphs for Better Intrusion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06226v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Provenance graph analysis plays a vital role in intrusion detection, particularly against Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), by exposing complex attack patterns. While recent systems combine graph neural networks (GNNs) with natural language processing (NLP) to capture structural and semantic features, their effectiveness is limited by class imbalance in real-world data. To address this, we introduce PROVSYN, a novel hybrid provenance graph synthesis framework, which comprises three components: (1) graph structure synthesis via heterogeneous graph generation models, (2) textual attribute synthesis via fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), and (3) five-dimensional fidelity evaluation. Experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that PROVSYN consistently produces higher-fidelity graphs across the five evaluation dimensions compared to four strong baselines. To further demonstrate the practical utility of PROVSYN, we utilize the synthesized graphs to augment training datasets for downstream APT detection models. The results show that PROVSYN effectively mitigates data imbalance, improving normalized entropy by up to 35%, and enhances the generalizability of downstream detection models, achieving an accuracy improvement of up to 38%.</p></details> |  |
| **[MINAR: Mechanistic Interpretability for Neural Algorithmic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21442v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent field of neural algorithmic reasoning (NAR) studies the ability of graph neural networks (GNNs) to emulate classical algorithms like Bellman-Ford, a phenomenon known as algorithmic alignment. At the same time, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spawned the study of mechanistic interpretability, which aims to identify granular model components like circuits that perform specific computations. In this work, we introduce Mechanistic Interpretability for Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (MINAR), an efficient circuit discovery toolbox that adapts attribution patching methods from mechanistic interpretability to the GNN setting. We show through two case studies that MINAR recovers faithful neuron-level circuits from GNNs trained on algorithmic tasks. Our study sheds new light on the process of circuit formation and pruning during training, as well as giving new insight into how GNNs trained to perform multiple tasks in parallel reuse circuit components for related tasks.

| **[Embodied Task Planning via Graph-Informed Action Generation with Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21841v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot reasoning capabilities, their deployment as embodied agents still faces fundamental challenges in long-horizon planning. Unlike open-ended text generation, embodied agents must decompose high-level intent into actionable sub-goals while strictly adhering to the logic of a dynamic, observed environment. Standard LLM planners frequently fail to maintain strategy coherence over extended horizons due to context window limitation or hallucinate transitions that violate constraints. We propose GiG, a novel planning framework that structures embodied agents' memory using a Graph-in-Graph architecture. Our approach employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode environmental states into embeddings, organizing these embeddings into action-connected execution trace graphs within an experience memory bank. By clustering these graph embeddings, the framework enables retrieval of structure-aware priors, allowing agents to ground current decisions in relevant past structural patterns. Furthermore, we introduce a novel bounded lookahead module that leverages symbolic transition logic to enhance the agents' planning capabilities through the grounded action projection. We evaluate our framework on three embodied planning benchmarks-Robotouille Synchronous, Robotouille Asynchronous, and ALFWorld. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving Pass@1 performance gains of up to 22% on Robotouille Synchronous, 37% on Asynchronous, and 15% on ALFWorld with comparable or lower computational cost.</p></details> |  |

Traditional simulators based on first-principles, however, typically require full-state observability or depend on parameter search for system identification. This work presents \texttt{CableRobotGraphSim}, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for cable-driven robots that aims to address shortcomings of prior simulation solutions. By representing cable-driven robots as graphs, with the rigid-bodies as nodes and the cables and contacts as edges, this model can quickly and accurately match the properties of other simulation models and real robots, while ingesting only partially observable inputs. Accompanying the GNN model is a sim-and-real co-training procedure that promotes generalization and robustness to noisy real data. This model is further integrated with a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller for closed-loop navigation, which showcases the model's speed and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

GNN models often contain millions of parameters, and like other neural network (NN) models, are often fed only a fraction of the graphs that make up the training dataset in batches to update model parameters. The effect of batching algorithms on training time and model performance has been thoroughly explored for NNs but not yet for GNNs. We analyze two different batching algorithms for graph-based models, namely static and dynamic batching for two datasets, the QM9 dataset of small molecules and the AFLOW materials database. Our experiments show that changing the batching algorithm can provide up to a 2.7x speedup, but the fastest algorithm depends on the data, model, batch size, hardware, and number of training steps run. Experiments show that for a select number of combinations of batch size, dataset, and model, significant differences in model learning metrics are observed between static and dynamic batching algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing Graph Neural Network Activation Patterns Through Graph Topology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21092v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvature notions on graphs provide a theoretical description of graph topology, highlighting bottlenecks and denser connected regions. Artifacts of the message passing paradigm in Graph Neural Networks, such as oversmoothing and oversquashing, have been attributed to these regions. However, it remains unclear how the topology of a graph interacts with the learned preferences of GNNs. Through Massive Activations, which correspond to extreme edge activation values in Graph Transformers, we probe this correspondence. Our findings on synthetic graphs and molecular benchmarks reveal that MAs do not preferentially concentrate on curvature extremes, despite their theoretical link to information flow. On the Long Range Graph Benchmark, we identify a systemic \textit{curvature shift}: global attention mechanisms exacerbate topological bottlenecks, drastically increasing the prevalence of negative curvature. Our work reframes curvature as a diagnostic probe for understanding when and why graph learning fails.</p></details> |  |

Spectral convergence of sampled graphs to graphons induces convergence of the corresponding neural operators, enabling transferability analyses of graph neural networks (GNNs). This paper develops a unified spectral framework that brings together convergence results under different assumptions on the underlying graphon, including no regularity, global Lipschitz continuity, and piecewise-Lipschitz continuity. The framework places these results in a common operator setting, enabling direct comparison of their assumptions, convergence rates, and tradeoffs. We further illustrate the empirical tightness of these rates on synthetic and real-world graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[CITED: A Decision Boundary-Aware Signature for GNNs Towards Model Extraction Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20418v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance in various applications, such as recommendation systems and financial risk management. However, deploying large-scale GNN models locally is particularly challenging for users, as it requires significant computational resources and extensive property data. Consequently, Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has become increasingly popular, offering a convenient way to deploy and access various models, including GNNs. However, an emerging threat known as Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs) presents significant risks, as adversaries can readily obtain surrogate GNN models exhibiting similar functionality. Specifically, attackers repeatedly query the target model using subgraph inputs to collect corresponding responses. These input-output pairs are subsequently utilized to train their own surrogate models at minimal cost. Many techniques have been proposed to defend against MEAs, but most are limited to specific output levels (e.g., embedding or label) and suffer from inherent technical drawbacks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel ownership verification framework CITED which is a first-of-its-kind method to achieve ownership verification on both embedding and label levels. Moreover, CITED is a novel signature-based method that neither harms downstream performance nor introduces auxiliary models that reduce efficiency, while still outperforming all watermarking and fingerprinting approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our CITED framework. Code is available at: https://github.com/LabRAI/CITED.</p></details> |  |

While self-explainable GNNs attempt to bridge this gap, they often rely on standard message-passing backbones that inherit fundamental limitations, including the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) expressivity barrier and a lack of fine-grained interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose SymGraph, a symbolic framework designed to transcend these constraints. By replacing continuous message passing with discrete structural hashing and topological role-based aggregation, our architecture theoretically surpasses the 1-WL barrier, achieving superior expressiveness without the overhead of differentiable optimization. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that SymGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing self-explainable GNNs. Notably, SymGraph delivers 10x to 100x speedups in training time using only CPU execution. Furthermore, SymGraph generates rules with superior semantic granularity compared to existing rule-based methods, offering great potential for scientific discovery and explainable AI.</p></details> | 23 pages, 9 pages |

A Benchmark for Long-Range Graph Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17762v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively capturing long-range interactions remains a fundamental yet unresolved challenge in graph neural network (GNN) research, critical for applications across diverse fields of science. To systematically address this, we introduce ECHO (Evaluating Communication over long HOps), a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess the capabilities of GNNs in handling very long-range graph propagation. ECHO includes three synthetic graph tasks, namely single-source shortest paths, node eccentricity, and graph diameter, each constructed over diverse and structurally challenging topologies intentionally designed to introduce significant information bottlenecks. ECHO also includes two real-world datasets, ECHO-Charge and ECHO-Energy, which define chemically grounded benchmarks for predicting atomic partial charges and molecular total energies, respectively, with reference computations obtained at the density functional theory (DFT) level. Both tasks inherently depend on capturing complex long-range molecular interactions. Our extensive benchmarking of popular GNN architectures reveals clear performance gaps, emphasizing the difficulty of true long-range propagation and highlighting design choices capable of overcoming inherent limitations. ECHO thereby sets a new standard for evaluating long-range information propagation, also providing a compelling example for its need in AI for science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026 ( https://openreview.net/forum?id=DgkWFPZMPp )</p></details> |
| **[A Secure and Private Distributed Bayesian Federated Learning Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20003v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed Federated Learning (DFL) enables decentralized model training across large-scale systems without a central parameter server. However, DFL faces three critical challenges: privacy leakage from honest-but-curious neighbors, slow convergence due to the lack of central coordination, and vulnerability to Byzantine adversaries aiming to degrade model accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel DFL framework that integrates Byzantine robustness, privacy preservation, and convergence acceleration. Within this framework, each device trains a local model using a Bayesian approach and independently selects an optimal subset of neighbors for posterior exchange. We formulate this neighbor selection as an optimization problem to minimize the global loss function under security and privacy constraints. Solving this problem is challenging because devices only possess partial network information, and the complex coupling between topology, security, and convergence remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first analytically characterize the trade-offs between dynamic connectivity, Byzantine detection, privacy levels, and convergence speed. Leveraging these insights, we develop a fully distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. This approach enables devices to make autonomous connection decisions based on local observations. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves superior robustness and efficiency with significantly lower overhead compared to traditional security and privacy schemes.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

We introduce SME-HGT, a Heterogeneous Graph Transformer framework that predicts which SBIR Phase I awardees will advance to Phase II funding using exclusively public data. We construct a heterogeneous graph with 32,268 company nodes, 124 research topic nodes, and 13 government agency nodes connected by approximately 99,000 edges across three semantic relation types. SME-HGT achieves an AUPRC of 0.621 0.003 on a temporally-split test set, outperforming an MLP baseline (0.590 0.002) and R-GCN (0.608 0.013) across five random seeds. At a screening depth of 100 companies, SME-HGT attains 89.6% precision with a 2.14 lift over random selection. Our temporal evaluation protocol prevents information leakage, and our reliance on public data ensures reproducibility. These results demonstrate that relational structure among firms, research topics, and funding agencies provides meaningful signal for SME potential assessment, with implications for policymakers and early-stage investors.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods still struggle with: 1) weak incorporation of temporal constraints in question representation, causing biased reasoning; 2) limited ability to perform explicit multi-hop reasoning; and 3) suboptimal fusion of language and graph representations. We propose a novel framework with temporal-aware question encoding, multi-hop graph reasoning, and multi-view heterogeneous information fusion. Specifically, our approach introduces: 1) a constraint-aware question representation that combines semantic cues from language models with temporal entity dynamics; 2) a temporal-aware graph neural network for explicit multi-hop reasoning via time-aware message passing; and 3) a multi-view attention mechanism for more effective fusion of question context and temporal graph knowledge.

For GNNs, however, message passing is topology-dependent and sensitive to misalignment, making direct parameter-space merging unreliable. To bridge this gap, we introduce H-GRAMA (Heterogeneous Graph Routing and Message Alignment), a training-free framework that lifts merging from parameter space to operator space. We formalize Universal Message Passing Mixture (UMPM), a shared operator family that expresses heterogeneous GNN layers in a common functional language. H-GRAMA enables cross-architecture GNN merging (e.g., GCN to GAT) without retraining, retaining high specialist accuracy in most cases in compatible depth settings and achieving inference speedups of 1.2x to 1.9x over ensembles.</p></details> |  |

However, practical deployment remains limited due to the prohibitive memory and runtime cost of operating on raw gate-level netlists. Graph coarsening is commonly used to improve scalability, yet its impact on CTS-critical learning objectives is not well characterized. This paper introduces CTS-Bench, a benchmark suite for systematically evaluating the trade-offs between graph coarsening, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency in GNN-based CTS analysis. CTS-Bench consists of 4,860 converged physical design solutions spanning five architectures and provides paired raw gate-level and clustered graph representations derived from post-placement designs. Using clock skew prediction as a representative CTS task, we demonstrate a clear accuracy-efficiency trade-off. While graph coarsening reduces GPU memory usage by up to 17.2x and accelerates training by up to 3x, it also removes structural information essential for modeling clock distribution, frequently resulting in negative $R^2$ scores under zero-shot evaluation. Our findings indicate that generic graph clustering techniques can fundamentally compromise CTS learning objectives, even when global physical metrics remain unchanged. CTS-Bench enables principled evaluation of CTS-aware graph coarsening strategies, supports benchmarking of GNN architectures and accelerators under realistic physical design constraints, and provides a foundation for developing learning-assisted CTS analysis and optimization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ML Bench'26 ASPLOS</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Network Assisted Genetic Algorithm for Structural Dynamic Response and Parameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22839v3)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimization of structural parameters, such as mass(m), stiffness(k), and damping coefficient(c), is critical for designing efficient, resilient, and stable structures. Conventional numerical approaches, including Finite Element Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, provide high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive for iterative optimization tasks, as each evaluation requires solving the governing equations for every parameter combination. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven framework that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) surrogate model with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizer to overcome these challenges. The GNN is trained to accurately learn the nonlinear mapping between structural parameters and dynamic displacement responses, enabling rapid predictions without repeatedly solving the system equations. A dataset of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system responses is generated using the Newmark Beta method across diverse mass, stiffness, and damping configurations. The GA then searches for globally optimal parameter sets by minimizing predicted displacements and enhancing dynamic stability. Results demonstrate that the GNN and GA framework achieves strong convergence, robust generalization, and significantly reduced computational cost compared to conventional simulations. This approach highlights the effectiveness of combining machine learning surrogates with evolutionary optimization for automated and intelligent structural design.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Towards A Universal Graph Structural Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10917v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large-scale pre-training have shown the potential to learn generalizable representations for downstream tasks. In the graph domain, however, capturing and transferring structural information across different graph domains remains challenging, primarily due to the inherent differences in graph topological patterns across various contexts. For example, a social network's structure is fundamentally different from that of a product co-purchase graph. Additionally, most existing models struggle to capture the rich topological complexity of graph structures, leading to inadequate exploration of the graph embedding space. To address these challenges, we propose GFSE, a universal pre-trained graph encoder designed to capture transferable structural patterns across diverse domains such as the web graph, social networks, and citation networks. GFSE is the first cross-domain graph structural encoder pre-trained with multiple self-supervised learning objectives. Built on a Graph Transformer, GFSE incorporates attention mechanisms informed by graph structural information, enabling it to encode intricate multi-level and fine-grained topological features within complex graph structures. The pre-trained GFSE produces generic and theoretically expressive positional and structural encoding for graphs, which can be seamlessly integrated with various downstream graph feature encoders, including graph neural networks for vectorized features and Large Language Models (LLMs) for text-attributed graphs. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate GFSE's capability to significantly enhance the model's performance while requiring substantially less task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Node Affinity Prediction in Temporal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06940v3)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS - Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising, training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics.

| **[Covariance Density Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11139v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have re-defined how we model and predict on network data but there lacks a consensus on choosing the correct underlying graph structure on which to model signals. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNN) address this issue by using the sample covariance matrix as a Graph Shift Operator (GSO). Here, we improve on the performance of VNNs by constructing a Density Matrix where we consider the sample Covariance matrix as a quasi-Hamiltonian of the system in the space of random variables. Crucially, using this density matrix as the GSO allows components of the data to be extracted at different scales, allowing enhanced discriminability and performance. We show that this approach allows explicit control of the stability-discriminability trade-off of the network, provides enhanced robustness to noise compared to VNNs, and outperforms them in useful real-life applications where the underlying covariance matrix is informative. In particular, we show that our model can achieve strong performance in subject-independent Brain Computer Interface EEG motor imagery classification, outperforming EEGnet while being faster. This shows how covariance density neural networks provide a basis for the notoriously difficult task of transferability of BCIs when evaluated on unseen individuals.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEDAN: Learning the Edit Costs for Graph Edit Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03111v3)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). However, most NN methods assume a unit cost for edit operations -- a restrictive and often unrealistic simplification, since topological and functional distances rarely coincide in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a fully end-to-end Graph Neural Network framework for learning the edit costs for GED, at a fine-grained level, aligning topological and task-specific similarity. Our method combines an unsupervised self-organizing mechanism for GED approximation with a Generalized Additive Model that flexibly learns contextualized edit costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach overcomes the limitations of non-end-to-end methods, yielding directly interpretable graph matchings, uncovering meaningful structures in complex graphs, and showing strong applicability to domains such as molecular analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Graph Neural Networks for Graph-level Tasks: Taxonomy, Empirical Study, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00773v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are fundamental data structures for modeling complex interactions in domains such as social networks, molecular structures, and biological systems. Graph-level tasks, which involve predicting properties or labels for entire graphs, are crucial for applications like molecular property prediction and subgraph counting. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant promise for these tasks, their evaluations are often limited by narrow datasets, task coverage, and inconsistent experimental setups, hindering their generalizability. In this paper, we present a comprehensive experimental study of GNNs on graph-level tasks, systematically categorizing them into five types: node-based, hierarchical pooling-based, subgraph-based, graph learning-based, and self-supervised learning-based GNNs. To address these challenges, we propose a unified evaluation framework OpenGLT for graph-level GNNs. OpenGLT standardizes the evaluation process across diverse datasets, multiple graph tasks (e.g., classification and regression), and real-world scenarios, including noisy, imbalanced, and few-shot graphs. Extensive experiments are conducted on 16 baseline models across five categories, evaluated on 13 graph classification and 13 graph regression datasets. These experiments provide comprehensive insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing GNN architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[E2E-GRec: An End-to-End Joint Training Framework for Graph Neural Networks and Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20564v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling graph-structured data and have been widely used in recommender systems, such as for capturing complex user-item and item-item relations. However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks Powered by Encoder Embedding for Improved Node Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11732v2)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for a wide range of node-level graph learning tasks. However, their performance typically depends on random or minimally informed initial feature representations, where poor initialization can lead to slower convergence and increased training instability. In this paper, we address this limitation by leveraging a statistically grounded one-hot graph encoder embedding (GEE) as a high-quality, structure-aware initialization for node features. Integrating GEE into standard GNNs yields the GEE-powered GNN (GG) framework. Across extensive simulations and real-world benchmarks, GG provides consistent and substantial performance gains in both unsupervised and supervised settings. For node classification, we further introduce GG-C, which concatenates the outputs of GG and GEE and outperforms competing methods, achieving roughly 10-50% accuracy improvements across most datasets. These results demonstrate the importance of principled, structure-aware initialization for improving the efficiency, stability, and overall performance of graph neural network architecture, enabling models to better exploit graph topology from the outset.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEHRGNN: A Unified Embedding Model for Knowledge Graphs with Hyperedges and Hyper-Relational Edges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18897v1)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph(KG) has gained traction as a machine-readable organization of real-world knowledge for analytics using artificial intelligence systems. Graph Neural Network(GNN), is proven to be an effective KG embedding technique that enables various downstream tasks like link prediction, node classification, and graph classification. The focus of research in both KG embedding and GNNs has been mostly oriented towards simple graphs with binary relations. However, real-world knowledge bases have a significant share of complex and n-ary facts that cannot be represented by binary edges. More specifically, real-world knowledge bases are often a mix of two types of n-ary facts - (i) that require hyperedges and (ii) that require hyper-relational edges. Though there are research efforts catering to these n-ary fact types, they are pursued independently for each type. We propose $H$yper$E$dge $H$yper-$R$elational edge $GNN$(HEHRGNN), a unified embedding model for n-ary relational KGs with both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges. The two main components of the model are i)HEHR unified fact representation format, and ii)HEHRGNN encoder, a GNN-based encoder with a novel message propagation model capable of capturing complex graph structures comprising both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges. The experimental results of HEHRGNN on link prediction tasks show its effectiveness as a unified embedding model, with inductive prediction capability, for link prediction across real-world datasets having different types of n-ary facts. The model also shows improved link prediction performance over baseline models for hyperedge and hyper-relational datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 Pa...</summary><p>38 Pages paper and 1 highlights page, 9 figures, 10 tables, Submitted to Elsevier Knowledge-Based Systems journal</p></details> |
| **[Are We Measuring Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks Correctly?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04591v4)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oversmoothing is a fundamental challenge in graph neural networks (GNNs): as the number of layers increases, node embeddings become increasingly similar, and model performance drops sharply. Traditionally, oversmoothing has been quantified using metrics that measure the similarity of neighbouring node features, such as the Dirichlet energy. We argue that these metrics have critical limitations and fail to reliably capture oversmoothing in realistic scenarios. For instance, they provide meaningful insights only for very deep networks, while typical GNNs show a performance drop already with as few as 10 layers. As an alternative, we propose measuring oversmoothing by examining the numerical or effective rank of the feature representations. We provide extensive numerical evaluation across diverse graph architectures and datasets to show that rank-based metrics consistently capture oversmoothing, whereas energy-based metrics often fail. Notably, we reveal that drops in the rank align closely with performance degradation, even in scenarios where energy metrics remain unchanged. Along with the experimental evaluation, we provide theoretical support for this approach, clarifying why Dirichlet-like measures may fail to capture performance drop and proving that the numerical rank of feature representations collapses to one for a broad family of GNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[L2G-Net: Local to Global Spectral Graph Neural Networks via Cauchy Factorizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18837v1)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their theoretical advantages, spectral methods based on the graph Fourier transform (GFT) are seldom used in graph neural networks (GNNs) due to the cost of computing the eigenbasis and the lack of vertex-domain locality in spectral representations. As a result, most GNNs rely on local approximations such as polynomial Laplacian filters or message passing, which limit their ability to model long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce a novel factorization of the GFT into operators acting on subgraphs, which are then combined via a sequence of Cauchy matrices. We use this factorization to propose a new class of spectral GNNs, which we term L2G-Net (Local-to-Global Net). Unlike existing spectral methods, which are either fully global (when they use the GFT) or local (when they use polynomial filters), L2G-Net operates by processing the spectral representations of subgraphs and then combining them via structured matrices. Our algorithm avoids full eigendecompositions, exploiting graph topology to construct the factorization with quadratic complexity in the number of nodes, scaled by the subgraph interface size. Experiments on benchmarks stressing non-local dependencies show that L2G-Net outperforms existing spectral techniques and is competitive with the state-of-the-art with orders of magnitude fewer learnable parameters.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches based on manual curation and literature review are labour-intensive and not scalable, prompting the use of machine learning on large biomedical data. In particular, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise for modelling complex biological relationships. To address limitations in existing models, we propose GLaDiGAtor (Graph Learning-bAsed DIsease-Gene AssociaTiOn pRediction), a novel GNN framework with an encoder-decoder architecture for disease-gene association prediction. GLaDiGAtor constructs a heterogeneous biological graph integrating gene-gene, disease-disease, and gene-disease interactions from curated databases, and enriches each node with contextual features from well-known language models (ProtT5 for protein sequences and BioBERT for disease text). In evaluations, our model achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalisation, outperforming 14 existing methods. Literature-supported case studies confirm the biological relevance of high-confidence novel predictions, highlighting GLaDiGAtor's potential to discover candidate disease genes. These results underscore the power of graph convolutional networks in biomedical informatics and may ultimately facilitate drug discovery by revealing new gene-disease links.

In this work, we introduce several novel concepts and capabilities to address obstacles faced by machine-assisted theorem proving. We first present a set of \textbf{atomic tactics}, a small finite set of tactics capable of proving any provable statement in Lean. We then introduce a \textbf{transposing atomization} algorithm which turns arbitrary proof expressions into a series of atomic tactics. We next introduce the \textbf{ExprGraph} data structure, which provides a succinct representation for Lean expressions. Finally, we present the \textbf{Nazrin Prover}, a graph neural network-based theorem proving agent using atomic tactics and ExprGraph. Nazrin circumvents many challenges faced by existing proving agents by exclusively dispatching atomic tactics, and it is robust enough to both train and evaluate on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the potential of tools like Nazrin using theorems from Lean's standard library and from Mathlib.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

Traditional methods often require prior knowledge and are susceptible to external disturbances. Learning-driven alternatives, while promising, frequently struggle with the scarcity of training data and fall short in generalization. To address these challenges, we propose Depth-PC, a novel visual servoing framework that leverages decoupled simulation-based training from real-world inference, achieving zero-shot Sim2Real transfer for servo tasks. To exploit spatial and geometric information of depth and point cloud features, we introduce cross-modal feature fusion, a first in servo tasks, followed by a dedicated Graph Neural Network to establish keypoint correspondences. Through simulation and real-world experiments, our approach demonstrates superior convergence basin and accuracy compared to SOTA methods, fulfilling the requirements for robotic servo tasks while enabling zero-shot Sim2Real transfer. In addition to the enhancements achieved with our proposed framework, we have also demonstrated the effectiveness of cross-modality feature fusion within the realm of servo tasks.

However, it often faces the issue of over-smoothing as the model depth increases, which causes all node representations to converge to a single value and become indistinguishable. This issue stems from the inherent limitations of GNNs, which struggle to distinguish the importance of information from different neighborhoods. In this paper, we introduce MbaGCN, a novel graph convolutional architecture that draws inspiration from the Mamba paradigm-originally designed for sequence modeling. MbaGCN presents a new backbone for GNNs, consisting of three key components: the Message Aggregation Layer, the Selective State Space Transition Layer, and the Node State Prediction Layer. These components work in tandem to adaptively aggregate neighborhood information, providing greater flexibility and scalability for deep GNN models. While MbaGCN may not consistently outperform all existing methods on each dataset, it provides a foundational framework that demonstrates the effective integration of the Mamba paradigm into graph representation learning. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that MbaGCN paves the way for future advancements in graph neural network research.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

In this work, we introduce the Complex-Valued Stuart-Landau Graph Neural Network (SLGNN), a novel architecture grounded in Stuart-Landau oscillator dynamics. Stuart-Landau oscillators are canonical models of limit-cycle behavior near Hopf bifurcations, which are fundamental to synchronization theory and are widely used in e.g. neuroscience for mesoscopic brain modeling. Unlike harmonic oscillators and phase-only Kuramoto models, Stuart-Landau oscillators retain both amplitude and phase dynamics, enabling rich phenomena such as amplitude regulation and multistable synchronization. The proposed SLGNN generalizes existing phase-centric Kuramoto-based OGNNs by allowing node feature amplitudes to evolve dynamically according to Stuart-Landau dynamics, with explicit tunable hyperparameters (such as the Hopf-parameter and the coupling strength) providing additional control over the interplay between feature amplitudes and network structure. We conduct extensive experiments across node classification, graph classification, and graph regression tasks, demonstrating that SLGNN outperforms existing OGNNs and establishes a novel, expressive, and theoretically grounded framework for deep oscillatory architectures on graphs.</p></details> |  |

Standard GNNs are limited to performing aggregation over immediate neighbourhoods or over global read-outs. To increase their expressivity, recent attempts have been made to incorporate substructural information (e.g. cycle counts and subgraph properties). In this paper, we formalize this architectural trend by introducing Template GNNs (T-GNNs), a generalized framework where node features are updated by aggregating over valid template embeddings from a specified set of graph templates. We propose a corresponding logic, Graded template modal logic (GML(T)), and generalized notions of template-based bisimulation and WL algorithm. We establish an equivalence between the expressive power of T-GNNs and GML(T), and provide a unifying approach for analysing GNN expressivity: we show how standard AC-GNNs and its recent variants can be interpreted as instantiations of T-GNNs.</p></details> |  |

However, current PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the soft constraint on the physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption. We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases to form a fully differentiable knownoperator layer inside the computation graph, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of 4-32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage and 0.08 deg in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5% and 87.1%, respectively.

However, they are often limited by scarce experimental property data and lack thermodynamic consistency. As such, thermodynamics-informed ML, i.e., incorporating thermodynamic relations into the loss function as regularization term for training, has been proposed. We herein transfer the concept of thermodynamics-informed graph neural networks (GNNs) from the Gibbs-Duhem to the Clapeyron equation, predicting several pure component properties in a multi-task manner, namely: vapor pressure, liquid molar volume, vapor molar volume and enthalpy of vaporization. We find improved prediction accuracy of the Clapeyron-GNN compared to the single-task learning setting, and improved approximation of the Clapeyron equation compared to the purely data-driven multi-task learning setting. In fact, we observe the largest improvement in prediction accuracy for the properties with the lowest availability of data, making our model promising for practical application in data scarce scenarios of chemical engineering practice.</p></details> |  |

Non-invasive, in-vivo measurement of these quantities can only be performed using a select number of modalities that are not widely available, such as 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this work, we create a surrogate model for hemodynamic flow field estimation, powered by machine learning. We train graph neural networks that include priors about the underlying symmetries and physics, limiting the amount of data required for training. This allows us to train the model using moderately-sized, in-vivo 4D flow MRI datasets, instead of large in-silico datasets obtained by computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as is the current standard. We create an efficient, equivariant neural network by combining the popular PointNet++ architecture with group-steerable layers. To incorporate the physics-informed priors, we derive an efficient discretisation scheme for the involved differential operators. We perform extensive experiments in carotid arteries and show that our model can accurately estimate low-noise hemodynamic flow fields in the carotid artery. Moreover, we show how the learned relation between geometry and hemodynamic quantities transfers to 3D vascular models obtained using a different imaging modality than the training data. This shows that physics-informed graph neural networks can be trained using 4D flow MRI data to estimate blood flow in unseen carotid artery geometries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in "Medical Image Analysis"</p></details> |

High-fidelity simulations are accurate but computationally costly, and despite recent advances, machine learning methods remain challenged by long-horizon temperature and gradient prediction. We propose a deep learning framework for predicting full temperature histories directly on meshes, conditioned on geometry and process parameters, while maintaining stability over thousands of time steps and generalizing across heterogeneous geometries. The framework adopts a temporal multiscale architecture composed of two coupled models operating at complementary time scales. Both models rely on a latent recurrent graph neural network to capture spatiotemporal dynamics on meshes, while a variational graph autoencoder provides a compact latent representation that reduces memory usage and improves training stability. Experiments on simulated powder bed fusion data demonstrate accurate and temporally stable long-horizon predictions across diverse geometries, outperforming existing baseline. Although evaluated in two dimensions, the framework is general and extensible to physics-driven systems with multiscale dynamics and to three-dimensional geometries.</p></details> |  |

Existing remedies such as graph transformers or rewiring typically incur high computational cost or require altering the graph structure. We introduce a Bakry-Emery graph Laplacian that integrates diffusion and advection through a learnable node-wise potential, inducing task-dependent propagation dynamics without modifying topology. This operator has a well-behaved spectral decomposition and acts as a drop-in replacement for standard Laplacians in spectral GNNs. Building on this insight, we develop mu-ChebNet, a spectral architecture that jointly learns the potential and Chebyshev filters, effectively bridging message-passing adaptivity and spectral efficiency. Our theoretical analysis shows how the potential modulates the spectrum, enabling control of key graph properties. Empirically, mu-ChebNet delivers consistent gains on synthetic long-range reasoning tasks, as well as real-world benchmarks, while offering an interpretable routing field that reveals how information flows through the graph. This establishes the Bakry-Emery Laplacian as a principled and efficient foundation for adaptive spectral graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Understanding and decoding cognitive brain states from fMRI depends on how functional interactions are represented. We propose an ensemble-based graph representation in which each edge weight encodes state evidence as the difference between posterior probabilities of two states, estimated by an ensemble of edge-wise probabilistic classifiers from simple pairwise time-series features. We evaluate the method on seven task-fMRI paradigms from the Human Connectome Project, performing binary classification within each paradigm. Using compact node summaries (mean incident edge weights) and logistic regression, we obtain average accuracies of 97.07-99.74 %. We further compare ensemble graphs with conventional correlation graphs using the same graph neural network classifier; ensemble graphs consistently yield higher accuracy (88.00-99.42 % vs 61.86-97.94 % across tasks). Because edge weights have a probabilistic, state-oriented interpretation, the representation supports connection- and region-level interpretability and can be extended to multiclass decoding, regression, other neuroimaging modalities, and clinical classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Simple Graphs: Neural Multi-Objective Routing on Multigraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22095v5)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. Yet, existing methods are unsuitable for routing on multigraphs, which feature multiple edges with distinct attributes between node pairs, despite their strong relevance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose two graph neural network-based methods to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach operates directly on the multigraph by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. The second model, which is more scalable, first simplifies the multigraph via a learned pruning strategy and then performs autoregressive routing on the resulting simple graph. We evaluate both models empirically, across a wide range of problems and graph distributions, and demonstrate their competitive performance compared to strong heuristics and neural baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026, Final Camera-Ready Version. 34 pages, 6 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Co-Evolution-Based Metal-Binding Residue Prediction with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16189v2)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding protein-metal interactions is central to structural biology, with metal ions being vital for catalysis, stability, and signal transduction. Predicting metal-binding residues and metal types remains challenging due to the structural and evolutionary complexity of proteins. Conventional sequence- and structure-based methods often fail to capture co-evolutionary constraints that reflect how residues evolve together to maintain metal-binding functionality. Recent co-evolution-based methods capture part of this information, but still underutilize the complete co-evolved residue network. To address this limitation, we introduce the Metal-Binding Graph Neural Network (MBGNN), which leverages the complete co-evolved residue network to better capture complex dependencies within protein structures. Experimental results show that MBGNN substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art co-evolution-based method MetalNet2, achieving F1 score improvements of 2.5% for binding residue identification and 3.3% for metal type classification on the MetalNet2 dataset. Its superiority is further demonstrated on both the MetalNet2 and MIonSite datasets, where it outperforms two co-evolution-based and two sequence-based methods, achieving the highest mean F1 scores across both prediction tasks. These findings highlight how integrating co-evolutionary residue networks with graph-based learning advances our ability to decode protein-metal interactions, thereby facilitating functional annotation and rational metalloprotein design. The code and data are released at https://github.com/SRastegari/MBGNN.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

We demonstrate this capability on an instance of the CANOS-PF graph neural network model, as implemented by the PF$Δ$ benchmark library, operating on a 14-bus test grid. Generated adversarial points yield errors as large as 3.4 per-unit in reactive power and 0.08 per-unit in voltage magnitude. When minimizing the perturbation from a training point necessary to satisfy adversarial constraints, we find that the constraints can be met with as little as an 0.04 per-unit perturbation in voltage magnitude on a single bus. This work motivates the development of rigorous verification and robust training methods for neural network surrogate models of AC power flow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Neural Multi-Agent Coordination for Distributed Access-Point Selection in Cell-Free Massive MIMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17954v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell-free massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) systems require scalable and reliable distributed coordination mechanisms to operate under stringent communication and latency constraints. A central challenge is the Access Point Selection (APS) problem, which seeks to determine the subset of serving Access Points (APs) for each User Equipment (UE) that can satisfy UEs' Spectral Efficiency (SE) requirements while minimizing network power consumption. We introduce APS-GNN, a scalable distributed multi-agent learning framework that decomposes APS into agents operating at the granularity of individual AP-UE connections. Agents coordinate via local observation exchange over a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture and share parameters to reuse their knowledge and experience. APS-GNN adopts a constrained reinforcement learning approach to provide agents with explicit observability of APS' conflicting objectives, treating SE satisfaction as a cost and power reduction as a reward. Both signals are defined locally, facilitating effective credit assignment and scalable coordination in large networks. To further improve training stability and exploration efficiency, the policy is initialized via supervised imitation learning from a heuristic APS baseline. We develop a realistic CFmMIMO simulator and demonstrate that APS-GNN delivers the target SE while activating 50-70% fewer APs than heuristic and centralized Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) baselines in different evaluation scenarios. Moreover, APS-GNN achieves one to two orders of magnitude lower inference latency than centralized MARL approaches due to its fully parallel and distributed execution. These results establish APS-GNN as a practical and scalable solution for APS in large-scale CFmMIMO networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission to an IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Graph Causal Classification Models: Estimating Causal Effects and Addressing Confounders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17941v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data is becoming increasingly prevalent due to the growing demand for relational insights in AI across various domains. Organizations regularly use graph data to solve complex problems involving relationships and connections. Causal learning is especially important in this context, since it helps to understand cause-effect relationships rather than mere associations. Since many real-world systems are inherently causal, graphs can efficiently model these systems. However, traditional graph machine learning methods including graph neural networks (GNNs), rely on correlations and are sensitive to spurious patterns and distribution changes. On the other hand, causal models enable robust predictions by isolating true causal factors, thus making them more stable under such shifts. Causal learning also helps in identifying and adjusting for confounders, ensuring that predictions reflect true causal relationships and remain accurate even under interventions. To address these challenges and build models that are robust and causally informed, we propose CCAGNN, a Confounder-Aware causal GNN framework that incorporates causal reasoning into graph learning, supporting counterfactual reasoning and providing reliable predictions in real-world settings. Comprehensive experiments on six publicly available datasets from diverse domains show that CCAGNN consistently outperforms leading state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Neighbourhood Learning for Invariant Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17934v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data often contain noisy and spurious correlations that mask the true causal relationships, which are essential for enabling graph models to make predictions based on the underlying causal structure of the data. Dependence on spurious connections makes it challenging for traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generalize effectively across different graphs. Furthermore, traditional aggregation methods tend to amplify these spurious patterns, limiting model robustness under distribution shifts. To address these issues, we propose Causal Neighbourhood Learning with Graph Neural Networks (CNL-GNN), a novel framework that performs causal interventions on graph structure. CNL-GNN effectively identifies and preserves causally relevant connections and reduces spurious influences through the generation of counterfactual neighbourhoods and adaptive edge perturbation guided by learnable importance masking and an attention-based mechanism. In addition, by combining structural-level interventions with the disentanglement of causal features from confounding factors, the model learns invariant node representations that are robust and generalize well across different graph structures. Our approach improves causal graph learning beyond traditional feature-based methods, resulting in a robust classification model. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets, including multiple domain variants of one dataset, demonstrate that CNL-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViGText: Deepfake Image Detection with Vision-Language Model Explanations and Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18031v2)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes. Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes, helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.</p></details> |  |
| **[COMBA: Cross Batch Aggregation for Learning Large Graphs with Context Gating State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17893v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) have recently emerged for modeling long-range dependency in sequence data, with much simplified computational costs than modern alternatives, such as transformers. Advancing SMMs to graph structured data, especially for large graphs, is a significant challenge because SSMs are sequence models and the shear graph volumes make it very expensive to convert graphs as sequences for effective learning. In this paper, we propose COMBA to tackle large graph learning using state space models, with two key innovations: graph context gating and cross batch aggregation. Graph context refers to different hops of neighborhood for each node, and graph context gating allows COMBA to use such context to learn best control of neighbor aggregation. For each graph context, COMBA samples nodes as batches, and train a graph neural network (GNN), with information being aggregated cross batches, allowing COMBA to scale to large graphs. Our theoretical study asserts that cross-batch aggregation guarantees lower error than training GNN without aggregation. Experiments on benchmark networks demonstrate significant performance gains compared to baseline approaches. Code and benchmark datasets will be released for public access.</p></details> |  |
| **[StableAML: Machine Learning for Behavioral Wallet Detection in Stablecoin Anti-Money Laundering on Ethereum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17842v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global illicit fund flows exceed an estimated $3.1 trillion annually, with stablecoins emerging as a preferred laundering medium due to their liquidity. While decentralized protocols increasingly adopt zero-knowledge proofs to obfuscate transaction graphs, centralized stablecoins remain critical "transparent choke points" for compliance. Leveraging this persistent visibility, this study analyzes an Ethereum dataset and uses behavioral features to develop a robust AML framework. Our findings demonstrate that domain-informed tree ensemble models achieve higher Macro-F1 score, significantly outperforming graph neural networks, which struggle with the increasing fragmentation of transaction networks. The model's interpretability goes beyond binary detection, successfully dissecting distinct typologies: it differentiates the complex, high-velocity dispersion of cybercrime syndicates from the constrained, static footprints left by sanctioned entities. This framework aligns with the industry shift toward deterministic verification, satisfying the auditability and compliance expectations under regulations such as the EU's MiCA and the U.S. GENIUS Act while minimizing unjustified asset freezes. By automating high-precision detection, we propose an approach that effectively raises the economic cost of financial misconduct without stifling innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Graph Neural Model Predictive Control for High-Dimensional Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17601v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The control of high-dimensional systems, such as soft robots, requires models that faithfully capture complex dynamics while remaining computationally tractable. This work presents a framework that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based dynamics models with structure-exploiting Model Predictive Control to enable real-time control of high-dimensional systems. By representing the system as a graph with localized interactions, the GNN preserves sparsity, while a tailored condensing algorithm eliminates state variables from the control problem, ensuring efficient computation. The complexity of our condensing algorithm scales linearly with the number of system nodes, and leverages Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) parallelization to achieve real-time performance. The proposed approach is validated in simulation and experimentally on a physical soft robotic trunk. Results show that our method scales to systems with up to 1,000 nodes at 100 Hz in closed-loop, and demonstrates real-time reference tracking on hardware with sub-centimeter accuracy, outperforming baselines by 63.6%. Finally, we show the capability of our method to achieve effective full-body obstacle avoidance.</p></details> |  |

While GNNs have demonstrated broad applicability, understanding their expressive power remains an important question. In this paper, we propose GNN architectures that correspond precisely to prominent fragments of first-order logic (FO), including various modal logics as well as more expressive two-variable fragments. To establish these results, we apply methods from finite model theory of first-order and modal logics to the domain of graph representation learning. Our results provide a unifying framework for understanding the logical expressiveness of GNNs within FO.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[From Subtle to Significant: Prompt-Driven Self-Improving Optimization in Test-Time Graph OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17342v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify whether a test graph deviates from the distribution of graphs observed during training, which is critical for ensuring the reliability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) when deployed in open-world scenarios. Recent advances in graph OOD detection have focused on test-time training techniques that facilitate OOD detection without accessing potential supervisory information (e.g., training data). However, most of these methods employ a one-pass inference paradigm, which prevents them from progressively correcting erroneous predictions to amplify OOD signals. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{I}mproving \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}ut-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{D}istribution detector (SIGOOD), which is an unsupervised framework that integrates continuous self-learning with test-time training for effective graph OOD detection. Specifically, SIGOOD generates a prompt to construct a prompt-enhanced graph that amplifies potential OOD signals. To optimize prompts, SIGOOD introduces an Energy Preference Optimization (EPO) loss, which leverages energy variations between the original test graph and the prompt-enhanced graph. By iteratively optimizing the prompt by involving it into the detection model in a self-improving loop, the resulting optimal prompt-enhanced graph is ultimately used for OOD detection. Comprehensive evaluations on 21 real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness and outperformance of our SIGOOD method. The code is at https://github.com/Ee1s/SIGOOD.</p></details> | 9pages, 5 figures |

To address this gap, we study an aggregate-and-readout model that encompasses several common message passing architectures: node features are first propagated over the graph then mapped to responses via a nonlinear function. For least-squares estimation over GNNs with linear graph convolutions and a deep ReLU readout, we prove a sharp non-asymptotic risk bound that separates approximation, stochastic, and optimization errors. The bound makes explicit how performance scales with the fraction of labeled nodes and graph-induced dependence. Approximation guarantees are further derived for graph-smoothing followed by smooth nonlinear readouts, yielding convergence rates that recover classical nonparametric behavior under full supervision while characterizing performance when labels are scarce. Numerical experiments validate our theory, providing a systematic framework for understanding GNN performance and limitations.</p></details> | 57 pages, 7 figures |

However, it remains unclear when multi-hop structural reasoning is actually necessary. In this work, we introduce locality radius, a formal measure of the minimum structural neighborhood required to determine a prediction in relational schemas. We hypothesize that model performance depends critically on alignment between task locality radius and architectural aggregation depth. We conduct a controlled empirical study across foreign key prediction, join cost estimation, blast radius regression, cascade impact classification, and additional graph-derived schema tasks. Our evaluation includes multi-seed experiments, capacity-matched comparisons, statistical significance testing, scaling analysis, and synthetic radius-controlled benchmarks. Results reveal a consistent bias-radius alignment effect.</p></details> |  |

To address these systemic vulnerabilities, we present AdvSynGNN, a comprehensive architecture designed for resilient node-level representation learning. The proposed framework orchestrates multi-resolution structural synthesis alongside contrastive objectives to establish geometry-sensitive initializations. We develop a transformer backbone that adaptively accommodates heterophily by modulating attention mechanisms through learned topological signals. Central to our contribution is an integrated adversarial propagation engine, where a generative component identifies potential connectivity alterations while a discriminator enforces global coherence. Furthermore, label refinement is achieved through a residual correction scheme guided by per-node confidence metrics, which facilitates precise control over iterative stability. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this synergistic approach effectively optimizes predictive accuracy across diverse graph distributions while maintaining computational efficiency. The study concludes with practical implementation protocols to ensure the robust deployment of the AdvSynGNN system in large-scale environments.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Predicting The Cop Number Using Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16600v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cops and Robbers is a pursuit evasion game played on a graph, first introduced independently by Quilliot \cite{quilliot1978jeux} and Nowakowski and Winkler \cite{NOWAKOWSKI1983235} over four decades ago. A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible.</p></details> | 8 pages |

We present an FPGA implementation of event-graph neural networks for audio processing. We utilise an artificial cochlea that converts time-series signals into sparse event data, reducing memory and computation costs. Our architecture was implemented on a SoC FPGA and evaluated on two open-source datasets. For classification task, our baseline floating-point model achieves 92.7% accuracy on SHD dataset - only 2.4% below the state of the art - while requiring over 10x and 67x fewer parameters. On SSC, our models achieve 66.9-71.0% accuracy. Compared to FPGA-based spiking neural networks, our quantised model reaches 92.3% accuracy, outperforming them by up to 19.3% while reducing resource usage and latency. For SSC, we report the first hardware-accelerated evaluation. We further demonstrate the first end-to-end FPGA implementation of event-audio keyword spotting, combining graph convolutional layers with recurrent sequence modelling.

This concept is developed within a one-dimensional framework as a foundational step. Traditional numerical methods, while effective, are computationally intensive and less scalable. By utilizing GNNs, the proposed model, termed the Collision-captured Network (CN), integrates data assimilation (DA) techniques to effectively learn and predict sea ice dynamics under various conditions. The approach was validated using synthetic data, both with and without observed data points, and it was found that the model accelerates the simulation of trajectories without compromising accuracy. This advancement offers a more efficient tool for forecasting in marginal ice zones (MIZ) and highlights the potential of combining machine learning with data assimilation for more effective and efficient modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating GNN Convergence on Large Randomly Generated Graphs with Realistic Node Feature Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16145v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are a number of existing studies analysing the convergence behaviour of graph neural networks on large random graphs. Unfortunately, the majority of these studies do not model correlations between node features, which would naturally exist in a variety of real-life networks. Consequently, the derived limitations of GNNs, resulting from such convergence behaviour, is not truly reflective of the expressive power of GNNs when applied to realistic graphs. In this paper, we will introduce a novel method to generate random graphs that have correlated node features. The node features will be sampled in such a manner to ensure correlation between neighbouring nodes. As motivation for our choice of sampling scheme, we will appeal to properties exhibited by real-life graphs, particularly properties that are captured by the Barabási-Albert model. A theoretical analysis will strongly indicate that convergence can be avoided in some cases, which we will empirically validate on large random graphs generated using our novel method. The observed divergent behaviour provides evidence that GNNs may be more expressive than initial studies would suggest, especially on realistic graphs.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |

Existing approaches face fundamental limitations: they cannot effectively share intelligence across borders due to privacy constraints, lack reasoning capabilities to understand complex multi-step attack patterns, and fail to capture intricate graph-structured relationships in financial networks. We introduce FedGraph-AGI, a novel federated learning framework integrating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) reasoning with graph neural networks for privacy-preserving cross-border insider threat detection. Our approach combines: (1) federated graph neural networks preserving data sovereignty; (2) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) aggregation for heterogeneous jurisdictions; and (3) AGI-powered reasoning via Large Action Models (LAM) performing causal inference over graph data. Through experiments on a 50,000-transaction dataset across 10 jurisdictions, FedGraph-AGI achieves 92.3% accuracy, significantly outperforming federated baselines (86.1%) and centralized approaches (84.7%). Our ablation studies reveal AGI reasoning contributes 6.8% improvement, while MoE adds 4.4%. The system maintains epsilon = 1.0 differential privacy while achieving near-optimal performance and scales efficiently to 50+ clients. This represents the first integration of AGI reasoning with federated graph learning for insider threat detection, opening new directions for privacy-preserving cross-border intelligence sharing.</p></details> | 35 Pages, 8 figures |

While generative modeling has revolutionized structure discovery for molecules, inorganic solids, and metal-organic frameworks, extending such approaches to fully periodic molecular crystals is still elusive. Here, we present MolCrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model for molecular crystal structure prediction. The framework disentangles intramolecular complexity from intermolecular packing by embedding molecules as rigid bodies and jointly learning the lattice matrix, molecular orientations, and centroid positions. Centroids and orientations are represented on their native Riemannian manifolds, allowing geodesic flow construction and graph neural network operations that respects geometric symmetries. We benchmark our model against state-of-the-art generative models for large-size periodic crystals and rule-based structure generation methods on two open-source molecular crystal datasets. We demonstrate an integration of MolCrystalFlow model with universal machine learning potential to accelerate molecular crystal structure prediction, paving the way for data-driven generative discovery of molecular crystals.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

In this work, we introduce a fully quantum graph convolutional architecture designed explicitly for unsupervised learning in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) regime. Our approach combines a variational quantum feature extraction layer with an edge-local and qubit-efficient quantum message-passing mechanism inspired by the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) framework. Unlike prior models that rely on global operations or multi-controlled unitaries, our model decomposes message passing into pairwise interactions along graph edges using only hardware-native single- and two-qubit gates. This design reduces the qubit requirement from $O(Nn)$ to $O(n)$ for a graph with $N$ nodes and $n$-qubit feature registers, enabling implementation on current quantum devices regardless of graph size. We train the model using the Deep Graph Infomax objective to perform unsupervised node representation learning. Experiments on the Cora citation network and a large-scale genomic SNP dataset demonstrate that our model remains competitive with prior quantum and hybrid approaches.</p></details> |  |

Traditional bot mitigation techniques, including IP blacklists and CAPTCHA-based challenges, are increasingly ineffective or intrusive, as modern bots leverage proxies, botnets, and AI-assisted evasion strategies. This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs. The proposed framework is deployment-friendly, integrates with existing systems without client-side instrumentation, and supports real-time inference and incremental updates, making it suitable for practical e-commerce security deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenDA: Generative Data Assimilation on Complex Urban Areas via Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11440v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes.

| **[A Code Smell Refactoring Approach using GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12069v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code smell is a great challenge in software refactoring, which indicates latent design or implementation flaws that may degrade the software maintainability and evolution. Over the past decades, a variety of refactoring approaches have been proposed, which can be broadly classified into metrics-based, rule-based, and machine learning-based approaches. Recent years, deep learning-based approaches have also attracted widespread attention. However, existing techniques exhibit various limitations. Metrics- and rule-based approaches rely heavily on manually defined heuristics and thresholds, whereas deep learning-based approaches are often constrained by dataset availability and model design. In this study, we proposed a graph-based deep learning approach for code smell refactoring. Specifically, we designed two types of input graphs (class-level and method-level) and employed both graph classification and node classification tasks to address the refactoring of three representative code smells: long method, large class, and feature envy. In our experiment, we propose a semi-automated dataset generation approach that could generate a large-scale dataset with minimal manual effort. We implemented the proposed approach with three classical GNN (graph neural network) architectures: GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT, and evaluated its performance against both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. The results demonstrate that proposed approach achieves superior refactoring performance.</p></details> |  |

While powerful, deep GNNs suffer from oversmoothing, where node features converge to a homogeneous, non-informative state. We re-frame this problem of representational collapse from a \emph{bifurcation theory} perspective, characterizing oversmoothing as convergence to a stable ``homogeneous fixed point.'' Our central contribution is the theoretical discovery that this undesired stability can be broken by replacing standard monotone activations (e.g., ReLU) with a class of functions. Using Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, we analytically prove that this substitution induces a bifurcation that destabilizes the homogeneous state and creates a new pair of stable, non-homogeneous \emph{patterns} that provably resist oversmoothing. Our theory predicts a precise, nontrivial scaling law for the amplitude of these emergent patterns, which we quantitatively validate in experiments. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our theory by deriving a closed-form, bifurcation-aware initialization and showing its utility in real benchmark experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Geometric Coherence of Global Aggregation in Federated GNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15510v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed training across multiple clients without centralized data sharing, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model relational data through message passing. In federated GNN settings, client graphs often exhibit heterogeneous structural and propagation characteristics. When standard aggregation mechanisms are applied to such heterogeneous updates, the global model may converge numerically while exhibiting degraded relational behavior.Our work identifies a geometric failure mode of global aggregation in Cross- Domain Federated GNNs. Although GNN parameters are numerically represented as vectors, they encode relational transformations that govern the direction, strength, and sensitivity of information flow across graph neighborhoods. Aggregating updates originating from incompatible propagation regimes can therefore introduce destructive interference in this transformation space.This leads to loss of coherence in global message passing. Importantly, this degradation is not necessarily reflected in conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy.To address this issue, we propose GGRS (Global Geometric Reference Structure), a server-side framework that regulates client updates prior to aggregation based on geometric admissibility criteria. GGRS preserves directional consistency of relational transformations as well as maintains diversity of admissible propagation subspaces. It also stabilizes sensitivity to neighborhood interactions, without accessing client data or graph topology. Experiments on heterogeneous GNN-native, Amazon Co-purchase datasets demonstrate that GGRS preserves global message-passing coherence across training rounds by highlighting the necessity of geometry-aware regulation in federated graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a developing preprint of an 18-page journal manuscript (6 figures), currently being prepared for formal peer-review submission</p></details> |
| **[NeuroLifting: Neural Inference on Markov Random Fields at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18954v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference in large-scale Markov Random Fields (MRFs) is a critical yet challenging task, traditionally approached through approximate methods like belief propagation and mean field, or exact methods such as the Toulbar2 solver. These strategies often fail to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and solution quality, particularly as the problem scale increases. This paper introduces NeuroLifting, a novel technique that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to reparameterize decision variables in MRFs, facilitating the use of standard gradient descent optimization. By extending traditional lifting techniques into a non-parametric neural network framework, NeuroLifting benefits from the smooth loss landscape of neural networks, enabling efficient and parallelizable optimization. Empirical results demonstrate that, on moderate scales, NeuroLifting performs very close to the exact solver Toulbar2 in terms of solution quality, significantly surpassing existing approximate methods. Notably, on large-scale MRFs, NeuroLifting delivers superior solution quality against all baselines, as well as exhibiting linear computational complexity growth. This work presents a significant advancement in MRF inference, offering a scalable and effective solution for large-scale problems.</p></details> |  |

A key design choice in GTs is the use of Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based positional encodings to incorporate structural information. In this work, we study GTs through the lens of manifold limit models for graph sequences and establish a theoretical connection between GTs with GNN positional encodings and Manifold Neural Networks (MNNs). Building on transferability results for GNNs under manifold convergence, we show that GTs inherit transferability guarantees from their positional encodings. In particular, GTs trained on small graphs provably generalize to larger graphs under mild assumptions. We complement our theory with extensive experiments on standard graph benchmarks, demonstrating that GTs exhibit scalable behavior on par with GNNs. To further show the efficiency in a real-world scenario, we implement GTs for shortest path distance estimation over terrains to better illustrate the efficiency of the transferable GTs. Our results provide new insights into the understanding of GTs and suggest practical directions for efficient training of GTs in large-scale settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grappa: Gradient-Only Communication for Scalable Graph Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01872v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-partition edges dominate the cost of distributed GNN training: fetching remote features and activations per iteration overwhelms the network as graphs deepen and partition counts grow. Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We present an asymptotically unbiased estimator for gradient correction, which we use to develop a minimum-distance batch-level variant that is compatible with common deep-learning packages. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4x faster on average (up to 13x) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching.</p></details> |  |

Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Wangshuaiia/iQUEST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025), Main Track</p></details> |

The ML-for-combinatorial-optimization community has focused on learning to \emph{replace} solvers, yet recent evidence shows that graph neural networks (GNNs) rarely outperform well-tuned classical methods on standard benchmarks. We pursue a different objective: learning to predict \emph{when} a given instance is hard for greedy allocation, enabling instance-dependent algorithm selection. We design a 20-dimensional structural feature vector and train a lightweight MLP hardness classifier that predicts the greedy optimality gap with mean absolute error 0.033, Pearson correlation 0.937, and binary classification accuracy 94.7\% across three random seeds. For instances identified as hard -- those exhibiting ``whale-fish'' trap structure where greedy provably fails -- we deploy a heterogeneous GNN specialist that achieves ${\approx}0\%$ optimality gap on all six adversarial configurations tested (vs.\ 3.75--59.24\% for greedy). A hybrid allocator combining the hardness classifier with GNN and greedy solvers achieves 0.51\% overall gap on mixed distributions. Our honest evaluation on CATS benchmarks confirms that GNNs do not outperform Gurobi (0.45--0.71 vs.\ 0.20 gap), motivating the algorithm selection framing. Learning \emph{when} to deploy expensive solvers is more tractable than learning to replace them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Cosmic Void Finding with Graph Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14630v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cosmic voids contain higher-order cosmological information and are of interest for astroparticle physics. Finding genuine matter underdensities in sparse galaxy surveys is, however, an underconstrained problem. Traditional void finding algorithms produce deterministic void catalogs, neglecting the probabilistic nature of the problem. We present a method to sample from the stochastic mapping from galaxy catalogs to arbitrary void definitions. Our algorithm uses a deep graph neural network to evolve "test particles" according to a flow-matching objective. We demonstrate the method in a simplified example setting but outline steps to generalize it towards practically usable void finders. Trained on a deterministic teacher, the model performs well but has considerable stochasticity which we interpret as regularization. Cosmological information in the predicted void catalogs outperforms the teacher. On the one hand, our method can cheaply emulate existing void finders with apparently useful regularization. More importantly, it also allows us to find the Bayes-optimal mapping between observed galaxies and any void definition. This includes definitions operating at the level of simulated matter density and velocity fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+3 p...</summary><p>8+3 pages, 9+2 figures.

Distilling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g., common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average 7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction method.

| **[Whom to Query for What: Adaptive Group Elicitation via Multi-Turn LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14279v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Eliciting information to reduce uncertainty about latent group-level properties from surveys and other collective assessments requires allocating limited questioning effort under real costs and missing data. Although large language models enable adaptive, multi-turn interactions in natural language, most existing elicitation methods optimize what to ask with a fixed respondent pool, and do not adapt respondent selection or leverage population structure when responses are partial or incomplete. To address this gap, we study adaptive group elicitation, a multi-round setting where an agent adaptively selects both questions and respondents under explicit query and participation budgets. We propose a theoretically grounded framework that combines (i) an LLM-based expected information gain objective for scoring candidate questions with (ii) heterogeneous graph neural network propagation that aggregates observed responses and participant attributes to impute missing responses and guide per-round respondent selection. This closed-loop procedure queries a small, informative subset of individuals while inferring population-level responses via structured similarity. Across three real-world opinion datasets, our method consistently improves population-level response prediction under constrained budgets, including a >12% relative gain on CES at a 10% respondent budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid TGN-SEAL Model for Dynamic Graph Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14239v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting links in sparse, continuously evolving networks is a central challenge in network science. Conventional heuristic methods and deep learning models, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically designed for static graphs and thus struggle to capture temporal dependencies. Snapshot-based techniques partially address this issue but often encounter data sparsity and class imbalance, particularly in networks with transient interactions such as telecommunication call detail records (CDRs). Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) model dynamic graphs by updating node embeddings over time; however, their predictive accuracy under sparse conditions remains limited. In this study, we improve the TGN framework by extracting enclosing subgraphs around candidate links, enabling the model to jointly learn structural and temporal information. Experiments on a sparse CDR dataset show that our approach increases average precision by 2.6% over standard TGNs, demonstrating the advantages of integrating local topology for robust link prediction in dynamic networks.</p></details> |  |

These graphs provide a hierarchical metric-semantic representation in which such concepts are organized. To further enhance graph-SLAM performance, Factorized 3D Scene Graphs incorporate these concepts as optimization factors that constrain relative geometry and enforce global consistency. However, both stages of this process remain largely manual: concepts are typically derived using hand-crafted, concept-specific heuristics, while factors and their covariances are likewise manually designed. This reliance on manual specification limits generalization across diverse environments and scalability to new concept classes. This paper presents a novel learning-based method that infers spatial concepts online from observed vertical planes and introduces them as optimizable factors within a SLAM backend, eliminating the need to handcraft concept generation, factor design, and covariance specification. We evaluate our approach in simulated environments with complex layouts, improving room detection by 20.7% and trajectory estimation by 19.2%, and further validate it on real construction sites, where room detection improves by 5.3% and map matching accuracy by 3.8%. Results confirm that learned factors can improve their handcrafted counterparts in SLAM systems and serve as a foundation for extending this approach to new spatial concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

Standard Large Language Modles (LLMs) are often unsuitable for this task due to context window limitations that prevent them from processing entire code repositories. As a result, various retrieval methods are commonly used, including keyword matching, text similarity, and simple graph-based heuristics such as Breadth-First Search. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising alternative due to their ability to model complex, repository-wide dependencies; however, their application has been hindered by the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce GREPO, the first GNN benchmark for repository-scale bug localization tasks. GREPO comprises 86 Python repositories and 47294 bug-fixing tasks, providing graph-based data structures ready for direct GNN processing. Our evaluation of various GNN architectures shows outstanding performance compared to established information retrieval baselines.

This approach limits the scalability and generalizability of GNNs, as models must be tailored for each specific graph type. To address these challenges, we introduce GraphFM, a scalable multi-graph pretraining approach designed for learning across diverse graph datasets. GraphFM uses a Perceiver-based encoder with learned latent tokens to compress domain-specific features into a shared latent space, enabling generalization across graph domains. We propose new techniques for scaling up graph training on datasets of different sizes, allowing us to train GraphFM on 152 distinct graph datasets, containing a total of 7.4 million nodes and 189 million edges. This allows us to study the effect of scale on pretraining across domains such as molecules, citation networks, and product graphs, and show that training on diverse datasets improves performance over single-source pretraining. Additionally, pretraining with a mixture of synthetic and real graphs enhances adaptability and stability, leading to competitive performance with state-of-the-art models across various node classification tasks. This approach reduces the burden of dataset-specific training and provides a single generalist model capable of performing across multiple diverse graph structures and tasks.

However, NAS-based methods are identified to be prone to over-smoothing-the loss of node distinguishability with increased iterations-thereby limiting their effectiveness. This paper identifies two characteristics in a network, i.e., the distributions of nodes and node degrees that are critical for expressive representation but have been overlooked in existing methods. We show that these overlooked characteristics contribute significantly to over-smoothing of NAS-methods. To address this, we propose a novel weighted distribution-aware kernel that embeds nodes while taking their distributional characteristics into consideration. Our method has three distinguishing features: (1) it is the first method to explicitly incorporate both distributional characteristics; (2) it requires no optimization; and (3) it effectively mitigates the adverse effects of over-smoothing, allowing WL to preserve node distinguishability and expressiveness even after many iterations of embedding. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior community detection performance via spectral clustering, outperforming existing graph embedding methods, including deep learning methods, on standard benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either focus on pixel-level fusion while overlooking downstream task adaptability or implicitly learn rigid semantics through cascaded detection/segmentation models, unable to interactively address diverse semantic target perception needs. We propose CtrlFuse, a controllable image fusion framework that enables interactive dynamic fusion guided by mask prompts. The model integrates a multi-modal feature extractor, a reference prompt encoder (RPE), and a prompt-semantic fusion module (PSFM). The RPE dynamically encodes task-specific semantic prompts by fine-tuning pre-trained segmentation models with input mask guidance, while the PSFM explicitly injects these semantics into fusion features. Through synergistic optimization of parallel segmentation and fusion branches, our method achieves mutual enhancement between task performance and fusion quality. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in both fusion controllability and segmentation accuracy, with the adapted task branch even outperforming the original segmentation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages,22 figures,published to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

This paper presents MPBS (Mobility-aware Prediction and Behavior-based Scheduling), a scalable task recruitment framework that treats each device as a recruitable "user". MPBS integrates three key modules: a behavior-aware KNN classifier, a time-varying Markov prediction model for forecasting device mobility, and a dynamic priority scheduling mechanism that considers task urgency and base station performance. By combining behavioral classification with spatiotemporal prediction, MPBS adaptively assigns tasks to the most suitable devices in real time. Experimental evaluations on the real-world GeoLife dataset show that MPBS significantly improves task completion efficiency and resource utilization. The proposed framework offers a predictive, behavior-aware solution for intelligent and collaborative scheduling in unmanned systems.</p></details> |  |

However, as the number of agents and task targets increases, existing optimization-based methods often incur prohibitive computational costs, posing significant challenges to large-scale coordination in unmanned systems. To address this issue, this paper proposes a K-means-inspired task allocation framework that reformulates the MTSP as a spatially constrained classification process. By leveraging spatial coherence, the proposed method enables fast estimation of path costs and efficient task grouping, thereby fundamentally reducing overall computational complexity. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the framework can maintain high solution quality even in extremely large-scale scenarios-for instance, in tasks involving 1000 agents and 5000 targets. The findings indicate that this "cluster-then-route" decomposition strategy offers an efficient and reliable solution for large-scale multi-agent task allocation.</p></details> |  |

Existing underwater diver communication methods face hurdles due to inherent disadvantages and complex underwater environments. To address this issue, we propose a scheme that utilizes maritime unmanned systems to assist divers with reliable and high-speed communication. Multiple AUVs are equipped with optical and acoustic multimodal communication devices as relay nodes, providing adaptive communication services based on changes in the diver's activity area. By using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to control the cooperative movement of AUVs, high-speed and reliable data transmission between divers can be achieved. At the same time, utilizing the advantages of on-demand deployment and wide coverage of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) as surface relay nodes to coordinate and forward information from AUVs, and controlling AUVs to adaptively select relay USV nodes for data transmission, high-quality communication between divers and surface platform can be achieved. Through simulation verification, the proposed scheme can effectively achieve reliable and high-speed communication for divers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn to reorganize and extend the current findings in a future version</p></details> |

However, limited communication bandwidth and the need for high-frequency interactions pose severe challenges to semantic information transmission within the swarm. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM-driven UAV swarms for autonomous semantic compression communication, aiming to reduce communication load while preserving critical task semantics. To this end, we construct four types of 2D simulation scenarios with different levels of environmental complexity and design a communication-execution pipeline that integrates system prompts with task instruction prompts. On this basis, we systematically evaluate the semantic compression performance of nine mainstream LLMs in different scenarios and analyze their adaptability and stability through ablation studies on environmental complexity and swarm size. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-based UAV swarms have the potential to achieve efficient collaborative communication under bandwidth-constrained and multi-hop link conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce MorphEUS, a morphable co-axial quadrotor that can control position and orientation independently with high efficiency. It uses a paired servo motor mechanism for each rotor arm, capable of pointing the vectored-thrust in any arbitrary direction. As compared to the \textit{state-of-the-art} OMAVs, we achieve higher and more uniform force/torque reachability with a smaller footprint and minimum thrust cancellations. The overactuated nature of the system also results in resiliency to rotor or servo-motor failures. The capabilities of this quadrotor are particularly well-suited for contact-based infrastructure inspection and close-proximity imaging of complex geometries. In the accompanying control pipeline, we present theoretical results for full controllability, almost-everywhere exponential stability, and thrust-energy optimality. We evaluate our design and controller on high-fidelity simulations showcasing the trajectory-tracking capabilities of the vehicle during various tasks. Supplementary details and experimental videos are available on the project webpage.</p></details> |  |

Today, heterogeneous air-ground collaborative multi-agent framework, which comprise unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), have presented superior flexibility and efficiency compared to traditional homogeneous frameworks in complex sensing tasks. Within this context, task allocation among different agents always play an important role in improving overall MCS quality. In order to better allocate tasks among heterogeneous collaborative agents, in this paper, we investigated two representative complex multi-agent task allocation scenarios with dual optimization objectives: (1) For AG-FAMT (Air-Ground Few Agents More Tasks) scenario, the objectives are to maximize the task completion while minimizing the total travel distance; (2) For AG-MAFT (Air-Ground More Agents Few Tasks) scenario, where the agents are allocated based on their locations, has the optimization objectives of minimizing the total travel distance while reducing travel time cost. To achieve this, we proposed a Multi-Task Minimum Cost Maximum Flow (MT-MCMF) optimization algorithm tailored for AG-FAMT, along with a multi-objective optimization algorithm called W-ILP designed for AG-MAFT, with a particular focus on optimizing the charging path planning of UAVs. Our experiments based on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrated that the proposed two algorithms both outperform baseline approaches under varying experimental settings, including task quantity, task difficulty, and task distribution, providing a novel way to improve the overall quality of mobile crowdsensing tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing unmanned systems often rely on GPS-based navigation, which is prone to inaccuracies in rural areas and limits flight paths to predefined routes, resulting in operational inefficiencies. To address these challenges, this paper presents ForaNav, an insect-inspired navigation strategy for autonomous navigation in plantations. The proposed method employs an enhanced Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG)-based tree detection approach, integrating hue-saturation histograms and global HOG feature variance with hierarchical HOG extraction to distinguish oil palm trees from visually similar objects. Inspired by insect foraging behavior, the MAV dynamically adjusts its path based on detected trees and employs a recovery mechanism to stay on course if a target is temporarily lost. We demonstrate that our detection method generalizes well to different tree types while maintaining lower CPU usage, lower temperature, and higher FPS than lightweight deep learning models, making it well-suited for real-time applications. Flight test results across diverse real-world scenarios show that the MAV successfully detects and approaches all trees without prior tree location, validating its effectiveness for agricultural automation.</p></details> |  |

Recently, infrared sensors have been widely deployed on mobile and stationary platforms for detection and classification of objects from long distances and in wide field of views. Given its success in the vision image analysis domain, deep learning has also been applied for object recognition in infrared images. However, techniques that have proven successful in visible light perception face new challenges in the infrared domain. These challenges include extremely low signal-to-noise ratios in infrared images, very small and blurred objects of interest, and limited availability of labeled/unlabeled training data due to the specialized nature of infrared sensors. Numerous methods have been proposed in the literature for the detection and classification of small objects in infrared images achieving varied levels of success. There is a need for a survey paper that critically analyzes existing techniques in this domain, identifies unsolved challenges and provides future research directions. This paper fills the gap and offers a concise and insightful review of deep learning-based methods. It also identifies the challenges faced by existing infrared object segmentation methods and provides a structured review of existing infrared perception methods from the perspective of these challenges and highlights the motivations behind the various approaches.

Current SLAM systems can achieve centimeter-level accuracy within a short period. However, there are still several challenges when dealing with largescale mapping tasks including significant storage requirements and difficulty of reusing the constructed maps. To address this, we first design an elastic and lightweight map representation called CELLmap, composed of several CELLs, each representing the local map at the corresponding location. Then, we design a general backend including CELL-based bidirectional registration module and loop closure detection module to improve global map consistency. Our experiments have demonstrated that CELLmap can represent the precise geometric structure of large-scale maps of KITTI dataset using only about 60 MB. Additionally, our general backend achieves up to a 26.88% improvement over various LiDAR odometry methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Over the last 55 years, Singapore has become an established purchaser of U.S. defense technology, but the past 20 years have also seen the U.S.-Singapore relationship mature into an increasingly collaborative one, tackling newer fields like cybersecurity and biosecurity. However, current geopolitical tensions present a challenge for Singapore, which strives to retain its strategic autonomy by maintaining positive relations with all parties. Paradoxically, the rise of non-traditional security threats may pave the way for greater bilateral cooperation by allowing Singapore to position itself as a hub for cooperation on regional security issues in Southeast Asia at large. In such spirit, this paper recommends that the United States and Singapore do the following: 1) in defense technology, co-develop niche capabilities in C4ISR and unmanned systems with peacetime applications; 2) in cybersecurity, improve their domestic resilience against sophisticated nation-state actors while also building regional capacity to counter cybercrime in Southeast Asia; and 3) in biosecurity, strengthen regional epidemiological surveillance to brace against possible future pandemics.</p></details> | 11 pages |

On one hand, big robotics companies offer training programs based on the job requirements. However, these training programs may not be as beneficial as general robotics programs offered by universities or community colleges. On the other hand, community colleges and universities face challenges with required resources, especially qualified instructors, to offer students advanced robotics education. Furthermore, the diverse backgrounds of undergraduate students present additional challenges. Some students bring extensive industry experiences, while others are newcomers to the field. To address these challenges, we propose a student-centered personalized learning framework for robotics. This framework allows a general instructor to teach undergraduate-level robotics courses by breaking down course topics into smaller components with well-defined topic dependencies, structured as a graph. This modular approach enables students to choose their learning path, catering to their unique preferences and pace. Moreover, our framework's flexibility allows for easy customization of teaching materials to meet the specific needs of host institutions. In addition to teaching materials, a frequently-asked-questions document would be prepared for a general instructor. If students' robotics questions cannot be answered by the instructor, the answers to these questions may be included in this document. For questions not covered in this document, we can gather and address them through collaboration with the robotics community and course content creators. Our user study results demonstrate the promise of this method in delivering undergraduate-level robotics education tailored to individual learning outcomes and preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, 2024 ASEE Conference</p></details> |

However, implementing CP still faces key challenges due to the characteristics of the CP task and the dynamics of wireless channels. In this article, a task-oriented wireless communication framework is proposed to jointly optimize the communication scheme and the CP procedure. We first propose channel-adaptive compression and robust fusion approaches to extract and exploit the most valuable semantic information under wireless communication constraints. We then propose a task-oriented distributed scheduling algorithm to identify the best collaborators for CP under dynamic environments. The main idea is learning while scheduling, where the collaboration utility is effectively learned with low computation and communication overhead. Case studies are carried out in connected autonomous driving scenarios to verify the proposed framework.

Specifically, we firstly explore the recent technical developments of NS-COM, followed by the discussions about motivations behind integrating NS-COM into SAGSIN. To further demonstrate the necessity of NS-COM, a comparative analysis between the NS-COM network and other counterparts in SAGSIN is conducted, covering aspects of deployment, coverage, channel characteristics and unique problems of NS-COM network. Afterwards, the technical aspects of NS-COM, including channel modeling, random access, channel estimation, array-based beam management and joint network optimization, are examined in detail. Furthermore, we explore the potential applications of NS-COM, such as structural expansion in SAGSIN communication, civil aviation communication, remote and urgent communication, weather monitoring and carbon neutrality. Finally, some promising research avenues are identified, including stratospheric satellite (StratoSat) -to-ground direct links for mobile terminals, reconfigurable multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and holographic MIMO, federated learning in NS-COM networks, maritime communication, electromagnetic spectrum sensing and adversarial game, integrated sensing and communications, StratoSat-based radar detection and imaging, NS-COM assisted enhanced global navigation system, NS-COM assisted intelligent unmanned system and free space optical (FSO) communication.

In particular, the DGVF controller provides a hierarchical architecture of an upper-level heterogeneous guidance velocity controller and a lower-level signal tracking regulator. Therein, the upper-level controller is to govern multiple heterogeneous USVs and UAVs to approach and maneuver along the prescribed paths and coordinate the formation simultaneously, whereas the low-level regulator is to track the corresponding desired guidance signals provided by the upper-level module. Significantly, the heterogeneous coordination among neighboring UAVs and USVs is achieved merely by the lightweight communication of a scalar (i.e., the additional virtual coordinate), which substantially decreases the communication and computational costs. Sufficient conditions assuring asymptotical convergence of the closed-loop system are derived in presence of the exponentially vanishing tracking errors. Finally, real-lake experiments are conducted on a self-established cross-domain heterogeneous platform consisting of three M-100 UAVs, two HUSTER-16 USVs, a HUSTER-12C USV, and a WiFi 5G wireless communication station to verify the effectiveness of the present DGVF controller.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, many existing Simultaneous Localization, Mapping and Moving Object Tracking (SLAMMOT) methods focus solely on estimating specific object poses and lack estimation of object scales and are unable to effectively track unknown objects. In this paper, we propose a novel SLAM backend that unifies ego-motion tracking, rigid object motion tracking, and modeling within a joint optimization framework. In the perception part, we designed a pixel-level asynchronous object tracker (AOT) based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and DeAOT, enabling the tracker to effectively track target unknown objects guided by various predefined tasks and prompts. In the modeling part, we present a novel object-centric quadric parameterization to unify both static and dynamic object initialization and optimization. Subsequently, in the part of object state estimation, we propose a tightly coupled optimization model for object pose and scale estimation, incorporating hybrids constraints into a novel dual sliding window optimization framework for joint estimation. To our knowledge, we are the first to tightly couple object pose tracking with light-weight modeling of dynamic and static objects using quadric. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on simulation datasets and real-world datasets, demonstrating the state-of-the-art robustness and accuracy in motion estimation and modeling. Our system showcases the potential application of object perception in complex dynamic scenes.</p></details> |  |

Unlike general-purpose systems, unmanned systems cannot deploy complete security protection schemes, due to their limitations in size, cost and performance. MCAs in unmanned systems are particularly difficult to defend against. Furthermore, MCAs have diverse and unpredictable attack interfaces in unmanned systems, severely impacting digital and physical sectors. In this paper, we first generalize, model and taxonomize MCAs found in unmanned systems currently, laying the foundation for designing a portable and general defense approach. According to different attack mechanisms, we found that MCAs are mainly categorized into two types--return2libc and return2shellcode. To tackle return2libc attacks, we model the erratic operation of unmanned systems with cycles and then propose a cycle-task-oriented memory protection (CToMP) approach to protect control flows from tampering. To defend against return2shellcode attacks, we introduce a secure process stack with a randomized memory address by leveraging the memory pool to prevent Shellcode from being executed. Moreover, we discuss the mechanism by which CToMP resists the ROP attack, a novel variant of return2libc attacks. Finally, we implement CToMP on CUAV V5+ with Ardupilot and Crazyflie. The evaluation and security analysis results demonstrate that the proposed approach CToMP is resilient to various MCAs in unmanned systems with low footprints and system overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a method that identifies obstacles in terms of ellipsoids to estimate linear and angular obstacle velocities. Our proposed method is based on the idea of any object can be approximately expressed by ellipsoids. To achieve this, we propose a method based on variational Bayesian estimation of Gaussian mixture model, the Kyachiyan algorithm, and a refinement algorithm. Our proposed method does not require knowledge of the number of clusters and can operate in real-time, unlike existing optimization-based methods. In addition, we define an ellipsoid-based feature vector to match obstacles given two timely close point frames. Our method can be applied to any environment with static and dynamic obstacles, including the ones with rotating obstacles.

In modern operational environments, all job plans are affected by emergency events such as equipment failures and resource shortages, making a quick resolution critical. The use of unmanned systems to assist decision-making can improve resolution efficiency, but their decision-making is not interpretable and may make the wrong decisions. Current unmanned systems require human supervision and control. Based on this, we propose a collaborative human--machine method for resolving unplanned events using two phases: task filtering and task scheduling. In the task filtering phase, we propose a human--machine collaborative decision-making algorithm for dynamic tasks. The GACRNN model is used to predict the state of the job nodes, locate the key nodes, and generate a machine-predicted resolution task list. A human decision-maker supervises the list in real time and modifies and confirms the machine-predicted list through the human--machine interface. In the task scheduling phase, we propose a scheduling algorithm that integrates human experience constraints. The steps to resolve an event are inserted into the normal job sequence to schedule the resolution. We propose several human--machine collaboration methods in each phase to generate steps to resolve an unplanned event while minimizing the impact on the original job plan.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |

However, due to the complexity of unmanned warehouse systems and their susceptibility to errors, incidents may occur during their operation, most often in inbound and outbound operations, which can decrease operational efficiency. Hence it is crucial to to improve the response to such incidents. This paper proposes a collaborative optimization algorithm for emergent incident response based on Safe-MADDPG. To meet safety requirements during emergent incident response, we investigated the intrinsic hidden relationships between various factors. By obtaining constraint information of agents during the emergent incident response process and of the dynamic environment of unmanned warehouses on agents, the algorithm reduces safety risks and avoids the occurrence of chain accidents; this enables an unmanned system to complete emergent incident response tasks and achieve its optimization objectives: (1) minimizing the losses caused by emergent incidents; and (2) maximizing the operational efficiency of inbound and outbound operations during the response process. A series of experiments conducted in a simulated unmanned warehouse scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

Through empirical analysis, infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) enables hard-to-find objects apparent, whereas multimodal salient object detection (SOD) accurately delineates the precise spatial location of objects within the picture. Their common characteristic of seeking complementary cues from different source images motivates us to explore the collaborative relationship between Fusion and Salient object detection tasks on infrared and visible images via an Interactively Reinforced multi-task paradigm for the first time, termed IRFS. To the seamless bridge of multimodal image fusion and SOD tasks, we specifically develop a Feature Screening-based Fusion subnetwork (FSFNet) to screen out interfering features from source images, thereby preserving saliency-related features. After generating the fused image through FSFNet, it is then fed into the subsequent Fusion-Guided Cross-Complementary SOD subnetwork (FC$^2$Net) as the third modality to drive the precise prediction of the saliency map by leveraging the complementary information derived from the fused image. In addition, we develop an interactive loop learning strategy to achieve the mutual reinforcement of IVIF and SOD tasks with a shorter training period and fewer network parameters. Comprehensive experiment results demonstrate that the seamless bridge of IVIF and SOD mutually enhances their performance, and highlights their superiority.</p></details> |  |

Current data is fragmented, siloed, and not easily accessible. There is data conflict, misuse, and eroding levels of trust in provenance and accuracy. With increased autonomy in aviation, Artificially Intelligent (AI) enabled unmanned traffic management (UTM) will be more reliant on secure data from diverse stakeholders. There is an urgent need to develop a secure network that has trustworthy data chains and works with the requirements generated by UTM. Here, we review existing research in 3 key interconnected areas: (1) blockchain development for secure data transfer between competing aviation stakeholders, (2) self-learning networking architectures that distribute consensus to achieve secure air traffic control, (3) explainable AI to build trust with human stakeholders and backpropagate requirements for blockchain and network optimisation. When connected together, this new digital ecosystem blueprint is tailored for safety critical UTM sectors. We motivate the readers with a case study, where a federated learning UTM uses real air traffic and weather data is secured and explained to human operators. This emerging area still requires significant research and development by the community to ensure it can enable future autonomous air mobility.</p></details> | under review in IEEE |

As a long-established problem, however, existing subspace methods suffer from either high complexity or low accuracy. In this work, we propose two efficient methods, to accomplish fast subspace computation and accurate angle of arrival (AoA) acquisition. By leveraging randomized low-rank approximation, our fast multiple signal classification (MUSIC) methods, relying on random sampling and projection techniques, substantially accelerate the subspace estimation by orders of magnitude. Moreover, we establish the theoretical bounds of our proposed methods, which ensure the accuracy of the approximated pseudo-spectrum. As demonstrated, the pseudo-spectrum acquired by our fast-MUSIC would be highly precise; and the estimated AoA is almost as accurate as standard MUSIC. In contrast, our new methods are tremendously faster than standard MUSIC. Thus, our fast-MUSIC enables the high-resolution real-time environmental sensing with massive MIMO radars, which has great potential in the emerging unmanned systems.</p></details> |  |

The estimation of signal/noise subspace, as one critical step, is yet computationally complex and presents a particular challenge when developing high-resolution yet low-complexity automotive radars. In this work, we develop a fast randomized-MUSIC (R-MUSIC) algorithm, which exploits the random matrix sketching to estimate the signal subspace via approximated computation. Our new approach substantially reduces the time complexity in acquiring a high-quality signal subspace. Moreover, the accuracy of R-MUSIC suffers no degradation unlike others low-complexity counterparts, i.e. the high-resolution angle of arrival (AoA) estimation is attained. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the performance of our R-MUSIC method. As shown, it resolves the long-standing contradiction in complexity and accuracy of MIMO radar signal processing, which hence have great potentials in real-time super-resolution automotive sensing.</p></details> |  |

Since the predetermined path is typically given by a set of data-points, not only the curvature and derivative of the pre-determined path are absent, but also it requires a large size of on-board memory. In this work, we study a simple path following algorithm called Carrot-chasing algorithm that uses a simple controller in the form of a proportional controller to control the movement of an unmanned system.</p></details> |  |
| **[P3-LOAM: PPP/LiDAR Loosely Coupled SLAM with Accurate Covariance Estimation and Robust RAIM in Urban Canyon Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02399v1)** | 2020-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has drawn increasing interests in autonomous driving. However, LiDAR-SLAM suffers from accumulating errors which can be significantly mitigated by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Precise Point Positioning (PPP), an accurate GNSS operation mode independent of base stations, gains more popularity in unmanned systems. Considering the features of the two technologies, LiDAR-SLAM and PPP, this paper proposes a SLAM system, namely P3-LOAM (PPP based LiDAR Odometry and Mapping) which couples LiDAR-SLAM and PPP. For better integration, we derive LiDAR-SLAM positioning covariance by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Jacobian model, since SVD provides an explicit analytic solution of Iterative Closest Point (ICP), which is a key issue in LiDAR-SLAM. A novel method is then proposed to evaluate the estimated LiDAR-SLAM covariance. In addition, to increase the reliability of GNSS in urban canyon environment, we develop a LiDAR-SLAM assisted GNSS Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) algorithm. Finally, we validate P$^3$-LOAM with UrbanNav, a challenging public dataset in urban canyon environment. Comprehensive test results prove that P3-LOAM outperforms benchmarks such as Single Point Positioning (SPP), PPP, LeGO-LOAM, SPP-LOAM, and loosely coupled navigation system proposed by the publisher of UrbanNav in terms of accuracy and availability.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Requirements to Autonomous Flight: An Overview of the Monitoring ICAROUS Project](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03745v1)** | 2020-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Independent Configurable Architecture for Reliable Operations of Unmanned Systems (ICAROUS) is a software architecture incorporating a set of algorithms to enable autonomous operations of unmanned aircraft applications. This paper provides an overview of Monitoring ICAROUS, a project whose objective is to provide a formal approach to generating runtime monitors for autonomous systems from requirements written in a structured natural language. This approach integrates FRET, a formal requirement elicitation and authoring tool, and Copilot, a runtime verification framework. FRET is used to specify formal requirements in structured natural language. These requirements are translated into temporal logic formulae. Copilot is then used to generate executable runtime monitors from these temporal logic specifications. The generated monitors are directly integrated into ICAROUS to perform runtime verification during flight.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings FMAS 2020, arXiv:2012.01176</p></details> |
| **[Long-distance tiny face detection based on enhanced YOLOv3 for unmanned system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04421v1)** | 2020-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote tiny face detection applied in unmanned system is a challeng-ing work. The detector cannot obtain sufficient context semantic information due to the relatively long distance. The received poor fine-grained features make the face detection less accurate and robust. To solve the problem of long-distance detection of tiny faces, we propose an enhanced network model (YOLOv3-C) based on the YOLOv3 algorithm for unmanned platform. In this model, we bring in multi-scale features from feature pyramid networks and make the features fu-sion to adjust prediction feature map of the output, which improves the sensitivity of the entire algorithm for tiny target faces. The enhanced model improves the accuracy of tiny face detection in the cases of long-distance and high-density crowds. The experimental evaluation results demonstrated the superior perfor-mance of the proposed YOLOv3-C in comparison with other relevant detectors in remote tiny face detection. It is worth mentioning that our proposed method achieves comparable performance with the state of the art YOLOv4[1] in the tiny face detection tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion Planning for Heterogeneous Unmanned Systems under Partial Observation from UAV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09633v2)** | 2020-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For heterogeneous unmanned systems composed of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), using UAVs serve as eyes to assist UGVs in motion planning is a promising research direction due to the UAVs' vast view scope. However, due to UAVs flight altitude limitations, it may be impossible to observe the global map, and motion planning in the local map is a POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) problem. This paper proposes a motion planning algorithm for heterogeneous unmanned system under partial observation from UAV without reconstruction of global maps, which consists of two parts designed for perception and decision-making, respectively. For the perception part, we propose the Grid Map Generation Network (GMGN), which is used to perceive scenes from UAV's perspective and classify the pathways and obstacles. For the decision-making part, we propose the Motion Command Generation Network (MCGN). Due to the addition of memory mechanism, MCGN has planning and reasoning abilities under partial observation from UAVs. We evaluate our proposed algorithm by comparing with baseline algorithms. The results show that our method effectively plans the motion of heterogeneous unmanned systems and achieves a relatively high success rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Cooperative Robotics and Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12230v1)** | 2020-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intersection of Quantum Technologies and Robotics Autonomy is explored in the present paper. The two areas are brought together in establishing an interdisciplinary interface that contributes to advancing the field of system autonomy, and pushes the engineering boundaries beyond the existing techniques. The present research adopts the experimental aspects of quantum entanglement and quantum cryptography, and integrates these established quantum capabilities into distributed robotic platforms, to explore the possibility of achieving increased autonomy for the control of multi-agent robotic systems engaged in cooperative tasks. Experimental quantum capabilities are realized by producing single photons (using spontaneous parametric down-conversion process), polarization of photons, detecting vertical and horizontal polarizations, and single photon detecting/counting. Specifically, such quantum aspects are implemented on network of classical agents, i.e., classical aerial and ground robots/unmanned systems. With respect to classical systems for robotic applications, leveraging quantum technology is expected to lead to guaranteed security, very fast control and communication, and unparalleled quantum capabilities such as entanglement and quantum superposition that will enable novel applications.</p></details> | 18 pages, 21 figures |

There has been tremendous growth in different applications of UAVs such as lifesaving and rescue missions, commercial use, recreations, etc. Unlike the traditional wireless communications, the data links for these systems do not have any general standardized framework yet to ensure safe co-existence of UAVs with other flying vehicles. This motivated us to provide a comprehensive survey of potential data link technologies available for UAVs. Our goal is to study the current trends and available candidates and carry out a comprehensive comparison among them. The contribution of this survey is to highlight the strength and weakness of the current data link options and their suitability to satisfy the UAVs communication requirements. Satellite links, cellular technologies, Wi-Fi and several similar wireless technologies are studied thoroughly in this paper. We also focus on several available promising standards that can be modified for these data links. Then, we discuss standard-related organizations that are working actively in the area of civilian unmanned systems. Finally, we bring up some future challenges in this area with several potential solutions to motivate further research work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Collision Probability Estimation Based on Finite-Dimensional Monte Carlo Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03973v1)** | 2020-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety concern for unmanned systems, namely the concern for the potential casualty caused by system abnormalities, has been a bottleneck for their development, especially in populated areas. Evidently, the collision between the unmanned system and the obstacles, including both moving and static objects, accounts for a great proportion of the system abnormalities. The route planning and corresponding controller are established in order to avoid the collision, whereas, in the presence of uncertainties, it is possible that the unmanned system would deviate from the predetermined route and collide with the obstacles. Therefore, for the safety of unmanned systems, collision probability estimation and further safety decision are very important. To estimate the collision probability, the Monte Carlo method could be applied, however, it is generally rather slow. This paper introduces a fast collision probability estimation method based on finite-dimensional distribution, whose main idea is to filter out the sampling points needed and generate the states directly by samples of finite-dimensional distribution, reducing the estimation time significantly. Besides, further techniques including the probabilistic equidistance sampling and dimension reduction, also serve to reduce the estimation time. The simulation shows that the proposed method reduces over 99% of the estimation time.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink) in a Nutshell: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10641v1)** | 2019-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink in short) is a communication protocol for unmanned systems (e.g., drones, robots). It specifies a comprehensive set of messages exchanged between unmanned systems and ground stations. This protocol is used in major autopilot systems, mainly ArduPilot and PX4, and provides powerful features not only for monitoring and controlling unmanned systems missions but also for their integration into the Internet. However, there is no technical survey and/or tutorial in the literature that presents these features or explains how to make use of them. Most of the references are online tutorials and basic technical reports, and none of them presents comprehensive and systematic coverage of the protocol. In this paper, we address this gap, and we propose an overview of the MAVLink protocol, the difference between its versions, and its potential in enabling Internet connectivity to unmanned systems. We also discuss the security aspects of MAVLink. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first technical survey and tutorial on the MAVLink protocol, which represents an important reference for unmanned systems users and developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Access, June 2019</p></details> |
| **[Fast Online Exact Solutions for Deterministic MDPs with Sparse Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02785v3)** | 2018-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are a mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision making under uncertainty. The classical approaches for solving MDPs are well known and have been widely studied, some of which rely on approximation techniques to solve MDPs with large state space and/or action space. However, most of these classical solution approaches and their approximation techniques still take much computation time to converge and usually must be re-computed if the reward function is changed. This paper introduces a novel alternative approach for exactly and efficiently solving deterministic, continuous MDPs with sparse reward sources. When the environment is such that the "distance" between states can be determined in constant time, e.g. grid world, our algorithm offers $O( |R|^2 \times |A|^2 \times |S|)$, where $|R|$ is the number of reward sources, $|A|$ is the number of actions, and $|S|$ is the number of states. Memory complexity for the algorithm is $O( |S| + |R| \times |A|)$. This new approach opens new avenues for boosting computational performance for certain classes of MDPs and is of tremendous value for MDP applications such as robotics and unmanned systems. This paper describes the algorithm and presents numerical experiment results to demonstrate its powerful computational performance. We also provide rigorous mathematical description of the approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NIPS 2018; preprint version posted here. 8 pages content, appendices include pseudocode and proof for algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Objective Cooperative Search of Spatially Diverse Routes in Uncertain Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04881v1)** | 2017-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on developing new navigation and reconnaissance capabilities for cooperative unmanned systems in uncertain environments. The goal is to design a cooperative multi-vehicle system that can survey an unknown environment and find the most valuable route for personnel to travel. To accomplish the goal, the multi-vehicle system first explores spatially diverse routes and then selects the safest route. In particular, the proposed cooperative path planner sequentially generates a set of spatially diverse routes according to a number of factors, including travel distance, ease of travel, and uncertainty associated with the ease of travel. The planner's dependence on each of these factors is altered by a weighted score, doing so changes the criteria for determining an optimum route. To penalize the selection of same paths by different vehicles, a control gain is used to increase the cost of paths that lie near the route(s) assigned to other vehicles. By varying the control gain, the spatial diversity among routes can be accomplished. By repeatedly searching for different paths cooperatively, an optimal path can be selected that yields the most valuable route.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to a conference</p></details> |

Target localization plays a crucial role in numerous applications, such as search, and rescue missions, traffic management and surveillance. The objective of this paper is to present an innovative target location learning approach, where numerous machine learning approaches, including K-means clustering and supported vector machines (SVM), are used to learn the data pattern across a list of spatially distributed sensors. To enable the accurate data association from different sensors for accurate target localization, appropriate data pre-processing is essential, which is then followed by the application of different machine learning algorithms to appropriately group data from different sensors for the accurate localization of multiple targets. Through simulation examples, the performance of these machine learning algorithms is quantified and compared.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted for conference publication</p></details> |
