| **[Unsupervised Meta-Learning for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04640v3)** | 2020-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta-learning algorithms use past experience to learn to quickly solve new tasks. In the context of reinforcement learning, meta-learning algorithms acquire reinforcement learning procedures to solve new problems more efficiently by utilizing experience from prior tasks. The performance of meta-learning algorithms depends on the tasks available for meta-training: in the same way that supervised learning generalizes best to test points drawn from the same distribution as the training points, meta-learning methods generalize best to tasks from the same distribution as the meta-training tasks. In effect, meta-reinforcement learning offloads the design burden from algorithm design to task design. If we can automate the process of task design as well, we can devise a meta-learning algorithm that is truly automated. In this work, we take a step in this direction, proposing a family of unsupervised meta-learning algorithms for reinforcement learning. We motivate and describe a general recipe for unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning, and present an instantiation of this approach. Our conceptual and theoretical contributions consist of formulating the unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning problem and describing how task proposals based on mutual information can be used to train optimal meta-learners. Our experimental results indicate that unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning effectively acquires accelerated reinforcement learning procedures without the need for manual task design and these procedures exceed the performance of learning from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Lineage Evolution Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14616v1)** | 2020-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a general agent population learning system, and on this basis, we propose lineage evolution reinforcement learning algorithm. Lineage evolution reinforcement learning is a kind of derivative algorithm which accords with the general agent population learning system. We take the agents in DQN and its related variants as the basic agents in the population, and add the selection, mutation and crossover modules in the genetic algorithm to the reinforcement learning algorithm. In the process of agent evolution, we refer to the characteristics of natural genetic behavior, add lineage factor to ensure the retention of potential performance of agent, and comprehensively consider the current performance and lineage value when evaluating the performance of agent. Without changing the parameters of the original reinforcement learning algorithm, lineage evolution reinforcement learning can optimize different reinforcement learning algorithms. Our experiments show that the idea of evolution with lineage improves the performance of original reinforcement learning algorithm in some games in Atari 2600.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9605103v1)** | 2014-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper surveys the field of reinforcement learning from a computer-science perspective. It is written to be accessible to researchers familiar with machine learning. Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word ``reinforcement.'' The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>See h...</summary><p>See http://www.jair.org/ for any accompanying files</p></details> |
| **[Transfer Learning in Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07888v7)** | 2023-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm for solving sequential decision-making problems. Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in reinforcement learning upon the fast development of deep neural networks. Along with the promising prospects of reinforcement learning in numerous domains such as robotics and game-playing, transfer learning has arisen to tackle various challenges faced by reinforcement learning, by transferring knowledge from external expertise to facilitate the efficiency and effectiveness of the learning process. In this survey, we systematically investigate the recent progress of transfer learning approaches in the context of deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, we provide a framework for categorizing the state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches, under which we analyze their goals, methodologies, compatible reinforcement learning backbones, and practical applications. We also draw connections between transfer learning and other relevant topics from the reinforcement learning perspective and explore their potential challenges that await future research progress.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Reinforcement Learning: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01452v2)** | 2023-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning is an essential paradigm for solving sequential decision problems under uncertainty. Despite many remarkable achievements in recent decades, applying reinforcement learning methods in the real world remains challenging. One of the main obstacles is that reinforcement learning agents lack a fundamental understanding of the world and must therefore learn from scratch through numerous trial-and-error interactions. They may also face challenges in providing explanations for their decisions and generalizing the acquired knowledge. Causality, however, offers a notable advantage as it can formalize knowledge in a systematic manner and leverage invariance for effective knowledge transfer. This has led to the emergence of causal reinforcement learning, a subfield of reinforcement learning that seeks to enhance existing algorithms by incorporating causal relationships into the learning process. In this survey, we comprehensively review the literature on causal reinforcement learning. We first introduce the basic concepts of causality and reinforcement learning, and then explain how causality can address core challenges in non-causal reinforcement learning. We categorize and systematically review existing causal reinforcement learning approaches based on their target problems and methodologies. Finally, we outline open issues and future directions in this emerging field.</p></details> | 52 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Two-Memory Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.10098v2)** | 2023-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep reinforcement learning has shown important empirical success, it tends to learn relatively slow due to slow propagation of rewards information and slow update of parametric neural networks. Non-parametric episodic memory, on the other hand, provides a faster learning alternative that does not require representation learning and uses maximum episodic return as state-action values for action selection. Episodic memory and reinforcement learning both have their own strengths and weaknesses. Notably, humans can leverage multiple memory systems concurrently during learning and benefit from all of them. In this work, we propose a method called Two-Memory reinforcement learning agent (2M) that combines episodic memory and reinforcement learning to distill both of their strengths. The 2M agent exploits the speed of the episodic memory part and the optimality and the generalization capacity of the reinforcement learning part to complement each other. Our experiments demonstrate that the 2M agent is more data efficient and outperforms both pure episodic memory and pure reinforcement learning, as well as a state-of-the-art memory-augmented RL agent. Moreover, the proposed approach provides a general framework that can be used to combine any episodic memory agent with other off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rating-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16348v2)** | 2024-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a novel rating-based reinforcement learning approach that uses human ratings to obtain human guidance in reinforcement learning. Different from the existing preference-based and ranking-based reinforcement learning paradigms, based on human relative preferences over sample pairs, the proposed rating-based reinforcement learning approach is based on human evaluation of individual trajectories without relative comparisons between sample pairs. The rating-based reinforcement learning approach builds on a new prediction model for human ratings and a novel multi-class loss function. We conduct several experimental studies based on synthetic ratings and real human ratings to evaluate the effectiveness and benefits of the new rating-based reinforcement learning approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of the paper "Rating-based Reinforcement Learning" accepted to the 38th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Learning in R](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.00240v1)** | 2018-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning refers to a group of methods from artificial intelligence where an agent performs learning through trial and error. It differs from supervised learning, since reinforcement learning requires no explicit labels; instead, the agent interacts continuously with its environment. That is, the agent starts in a specific state and then performs an action, based on which it transitions to a new state and, depending on the outcome, receives a reward. Different strategies (e.g. Q-learning) have been proposed to maximize the overall reward, resulting in a so-called policy, which defines the best possible action in each state. Mathematically, this process can be formalized by a Markov decision process and it has been implemented by packages in R; however, there is currently no package available for reinforcement learning. As a remedy, this paper demonstrates how to perform reinforcement learning in R and, for this purpose, introduces the ReinforcementLearning package. The package provides a remarkably flexible framework and is easily applied to a wide range of different problems. We demonstrate its use by drawing upon common examples from the literature (e.g. finding optimal game strategies).</p></details> |  |

Many of these operational aspects of astronomy are guided and executed by expert astronomers. Reinforcement learning is a mechanism where we (as humans and astronomers) can teach agents of artificial intelligence to perform some of these tedious tasks. In this paper, we will present a state of the art overview of reinforcement learning and how it can benefit astronomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear, Astronomy & Computing</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Evolutionary Learning Method for self-learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03198v1)** | 2018-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In statistical modelling the biggest threat is concept drift which makes the model gradually showing deteriorating performance over time. There are state of the art methodologies to detect the impact of concept drift, however general strategy considered to overcome the issue in performance is to rebuild or re-calibrate the model periodically as the variable patterns for the model changes significantly due to market change or consumer behavior change etc. Quantitative research is the most widely spread application of data science in Marketing or financial domain where applicability of state of the art reinforcement learning for auto-learning is less explored paradigm. Reinforcement learning is heavily dependent on having a simulated environment which is majorly available for gaming or online systems, to learn from the live feedback. However, there are some research happened on the area of online advertisement, pricing etc where due to the nature of the online learning environment scope of reinforcement learning is explored. Our proposed solution is a reinforcement learning based, true self-learning algorithm which can adapt to the data change or concept drift and auto learn and self-calibrate for the new patterns of the data solving the problem of concept drift.

| **[Interpretable Reinforcement Learning with Ensemble Methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06995v1)** | 2018-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose to use boosted regression trees as a way to compute human-interpretable solutions to reinforcement learning problems. Boosting combines several regression trees to improve their accuracy without significantly reducing their inherent interpretability. Prior work has focused independently on reinforcement learning and on interpretable machine learning, but there has been little progress in interpretable reinforcement learning. Our experimental results show that boosted regression trees compute solutions that are both interpretable and match the quality of leading reinforcement learning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximating Shapley Explanations in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06094v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable success in complex decision-making environments, yet its lack of transparency limits its deployment in practice, especially in safety-critical settings. Shapley values from cooperative game theory provide a principled framework for explaining reinforcement learning; however, the computational cost of Shapley explanations is an obstacle to their use. We introduce FastSVERL, a scalable method for explaining reinforcement learning by approximating Shapley values. FastSVERL is designed to handle the unique challenges of reinforcement learning, including temporal dependencies across multi-step trajectories, learning from off-policy data, and adapting to evolving agent behaviours in real time. FastSVERL introduces a practical, scalable approach for principled and rigorous interpretability in reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version.

| **[Rethinking the Foundations for Continual Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08161v3)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the traditional view of reinforcement learning, the agent's goal is to find an optimal policy that maximizes its expected sum of rewards. Once the agent finds this policy, the learning ends. This view contrasts with \emph{continual reinforcement learning}, where learning does not end, and agents are expected to continually learn and adapt indefinitely. Despite the clear distinction between these two paradigms of learning, much of the progress in continual reinforcement learning has been shaped by foundations rooted in the traditional view of reinforcement learning. In this paper, we first examine whether the foundations of traditional reinforcement learning are suitable for the continual reinforcement learning paradigm. We identify four key pillars of the traditional reinforcement learning foundations that are antithetical to the goals of continual learning: the Markov decision process formalism, the focus on atemporal artifacts, the expected sum of rewards as an evaluation metric, and episodic benchmark environments that embrace the other three foundations. We then propose a new formalism that sheds the first and the third foundations and replaces them with the history process as a mathematical formalism and a new definition of deviation regret, adapted for continual learning, as an evaluation metric. Finally, we discuss possible approaches to shed the other two foundations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Definition of Continual Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11046v2)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a standard view of the reinforcement learning problem, an agent's goal is to efficiently identify a policy that maximizes long-term reward. However, this perspective is based on a restricted view of learning as finding a solution, rather than treating learning as endless adaptation. In contrast, continual reinforcement learning refers to the setting in which the best agents never stop learning. Despite the importance of continual reinforcement learning, the community lacks a simple definition of the problem that highlights its commitments and makes its primary concepts precise and clear. To this end, this paper is dedicated to carefully defining the continual reinforcement learning problem. We formalize the notion of agents that "never stop learning" through a new mathematical language for analyzing and cataloging agents. Using this new language, we define a continual learning agent as one that can be understood as carrying out an implicit search process indefinitely, and continual reinforcement learning as the setting in which the best agents are all continual learning agents. We provide two motivating examples, illustrating that traditional views of multi-task reinforcement learning and continual supervised learning are special cases of our definition. Collectively, these definitions and perspectives formalize many intuitive concepts at the heart of learning, and open new research pathways surrounding continual learning agents.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2023 |
| **[Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.08277v3)** | 2020-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In deep reinforcement learning, building policies of high-quality is challenging when the feature space of states is small and the training data is limited. Despite the success of previous transfer learning approaches in deep reinforcement learning, directly transferring data or models from an agent to another agent is often not allowed due to the privacy of data and/or models in many privacy-aware applications. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning framework to federatively build models of high-quality for agents with consideration of their privacies, namely Federated deep Reinforcement Learning (FedRL). To protect the privacy of data and models, we exploit Gausian differentials on the information shared with each other when updating their local models. In the experiment, we evaluate our FedRL framework in two diverse domains, Grid-world and Text2Action domains, by comparing to various baselines.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Object-sensitive Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06064v1)** | 2018-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning has become popular over recent years, showing superiority on different visual-input tasks such as playing Atari games and robot navigation. Although objects are important image elements, few work considers enhancing deep reinforcement learning with object characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can incorporate object recognition processing to deep reinforcement learning models. This approach can be adapted to any existing deep reinforcement learning frameworks. State-of-the-art results are shown in experiments on Atari games. We also propose a new approach called "object saliency maps" to visually explain the actions made by deep reinforcement learning agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, Accepted at 3rd Global Conference on Artificial Intelligence (GCAI-17), Miami, 2017</p></details> |
| **[Learning Robust Rewards with Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.11248v2)** | 2018-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning provides a powerful and general framework for decision making and control, but its application in practice is often hindered by the need for extensive feature and reward engineering. Deep reinforcement learning methods can remove the need for explicit engineering of policy or value features, but still require a manually specified reward function. Inverse reinforcement learning holds the promise of automatic reward acquisition, but has proven exceptionally difficult to apply to large, high-dimensional problems with unknown dynamics. In this work, we propose adverserial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL), a practical and scalable inverse reinforcement learning algorithm based on an adversarial reward learning formulation. We demonstrate that AIRL is able to recover reward functions that are robust to changes in dynamics, enabling us to learn policies even under significant variation in the environment seen during training. Our experiments show that AIRL greatly outperforms prior methods in these transfer settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Malthusian Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07019v2)** | 2019-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Here we explore a new algorithmic framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning, called Malthusian reinforcement learning, which extends self-play to include fitness-linked population size dynamics that drive ongoing innovation. In Malthusian RL, increases in a subpopulation's average return drive subsequent increases in its size, just as Thomas Malthus argued in 1798 was the relationship between preindustrial income levels and population growth. Malthusian reinforcement learning harnesses the competitive pressures arising from growing and shrinking population size to drive agents to explore regions of state and policy spaces that they could not otherwise reach. Furthermore, in environments where there are potential gains from specialization and division of labor, we show that Malthusian reinforcement learning is better positioned to take advantage of such synergies than algorithms based on self-play.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Deep Ordinal Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02005v2)** | 2020-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning usually makes use of numerical rewards, which have nice properties but also come with drawbacks and difficulties. Using rewards on an ordinal scale (ordinal rewards) is an alternative to numerical rewards that has received more attention in recent years. In this paper, a general approach to adapting reinforcement learning problems to the use of ordinal rewards is presented and motivated. We show how to convert common reinforcement learning algorithms to an ordinal variation by the example of Q-learning and introduce Ordinal Deep Q-Networks, which adapt deep reinforcement learning to ordinal rewards. Additionally, we run evaluations on problems provided by the OpenAI Gym framework, showing that our ordinal variants exhibit a performance that is comparable to the numerical variations for a number of problems. We also give first evidence that our ordinal variant is able to produce better results for problems with less engineered and simpler-to-design reward signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>repla...</summary><p>replaced figures for better visibility, added github repository, more details about source of experimental results, updated target value calculation for standard and ordinal Deep Q-Network</p></details> |

The learning can be viewed as browsing a set of policies while evaluating them by trial through interaction with the environment. We present an application of gradient ascent algorithm for reinforcement learning to a complex domain of packet routing in network communication and compare the performance of this algorithm to other routing methods on a benchmark problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Brief Survey of Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05866v2)** | 2017-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning is poised to revolutionise the field of AI and represents a step towards building autonomous systems with a higher level understanding of the visual world. Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning to scale to problems that were previously intractable, such as learning to play video games directly from pixels. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms are also applied to robotics, allowing control policies for robots to be learned directly from camera inputs in the real world. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the general field of reinforcement learning, then progress to the main streams of value-based and policy-based methods. Our survey will cover central algorithms in deep reinforcement learning, including the deep $Q$-network, trust region policy optimisation, and asynchronous advantage actor-critic. In parallel, we highlight the unique advantages of deep neural networks, focusing on visual understanding via reinforcement learning. To conclude, we describe several current areas of research within the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, Special Issue on Deep Learning for Image Understanding (arXiv extended version)</p></details> |
| **[A Review of Uncertainty for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.09052v1)** | 2022-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty is ubiquitous in games, both in the agents playing games and often in the games themselves. Working with uncertainty is therefore an important component of successful deep reinforcement learning agents. While there has been substantial effort and progress in understanding and working with uncertainty for supervised learning, the body of literature for uncertainty aware deep reinforcement learning is less developed. While many of the same problems regarding uncertainty in neural networks for supervised learning remain for reinforcement learning, there are additional sources of uncertainty due to the nature of an interactable environment. In this work, we provide an overview motivating and presenting existing techniques in uncertainty aware deep reinforcement learning. These works show empirical benefits on a variety of reinforcement learning tasks. This work serves to help to centralize the disparate results and promote future research in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AIIDE 2022</p></details> |
| **[A View on Deep Reinforcement Learning in System Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01275v3)** | 2019-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world systems problems require reasoning about the long term consequences of actions taken to configure and manage the system. These problems with delayed and often sequentially aggregated reward, are often inherently reinforcement learning problems and present the opportunity to leverage the recent substantial advances in deep reinforcement learning. However, in some cases, it is not clear why deep reinforcement learning is a good fit for the problem. Sometimes, it does not perform better than the state-of-the-art solutions. And in other cases, random search or greedy algorithms could outperform deep reinforcement learning. In this paper, we review, discuss, and evaluate the recent trends of using deep reinforcement learning in system optimization. We propose a set of essential metrics to guide future works in evaluating the efficacy of using deep reinforcement learning in system optimization. Our evaluation includes challenges, the types of problems, their formulation in the deep reinforcement learning setting, embedding, the model used, efficiency, and robustness. We conclude with a discussion on open challenges and potential directions for pushing further the integration of reinforcement learning in system optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning in Economics and Finance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10014v1)** | 2020-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning algorithms describe how an agent can learn an optimal action policy in a sequential decision process, through repeated experience. In a given environment, the agent policy provides him some running and terminal rewards. As in online learning, the agent learns sequentially. As in multi-armed bandit problems, when an agent picks an action, he can not infer ex-post the rewards induced by other action choices. In reinforcement learning, his actions have consequences: they influence not only rewards, but also future states of the world. The goal of reinforcement learning is to find an optimal policy -- a mapping from the states of the world to the set of actions, in order to maximize cumulative reward, which is a long term strategy. Exploring might be sub-optimal on a short-term horizon but could lead to optimal long-term ones. Many problems of optimal control, popular in economics for more than forty years, can be expressed in the reinforcement learning framework, and recent advances in computational science, provided in particular by deep learning algorithms, can be used by economists in order to solve complex behavioral problems. In this article, we propose a state-of-the-art of reinforcement learning techniques, and present applications in economics, game theory, operation research and finance.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Difficulty of Passive Learning in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14020v1)** | 2021-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to act from observational data without active environmental interaction is a well-known challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Recent approaches involve constraints on the learned policy or conservative updates, preventing strong deviations from the state-action distribution of the dataset. Although these methods are evaluated using non-linear function approximation, theoretical justifications are mostly limited to the tabular or linear cases. Given the impressive results of deep reinforcement learning, we argue for a need to more clearly understand the challenges in this setting. In the vein of Held & Hein's classic 1963 experiment, we propose the "tandem learning" experimental paradigm which facilitates our empirical analysis of the difficulties in offline reinforcement learning. We identify function approximation in conjunction with fixed data distributions as the strongest factors, thereby extending but also challenging hypotheses stated in past work. Our results provide relevant insights for offline deep reinforcement learning, while also shedding new light on phenomena observed in the online case of learning control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at NeurIPS 2021</p></details> |

| **[A survey of benchmarking frameworks for reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13577v1)** | 2020-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has recently experienced increased prominence in the machine learning community. There are many approaches to solving reinforcement learning problems with new techniques developed constantly. When solving problems using reinforcement learning, there are various difficult challenges to overcome. To ensure progress in the field, benchmarks are important for testing new algorithms and comparing with other approaches. The reproducibility of results for fair comparison is therefore vital in ensuring that improvements are accurately judged. This paper provides an overview of different contributions to reinforcement learning benchmarking and discusses how they can assist researchers to address the challenges facing reinforcement learning. The contributions discussed are the most used and recent in the literature. The paper discusses the contributions in terms of implementation, tasks and provided algorithm implementations with benchmarks. The survey aims to bring attention to the wide range of reinforcement learning benchmarking tasks available and to encourage research to take place in a standardised manner. Additionally, this survey acts as an overview for researchers not familiar with the different tasks that can be used to develop and test new reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning and Machine ethics:a systematic review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02425v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine ethics is the field that studies how ethical behaviour can be accomplished by autonomous systems. While there exist some systematic reviews aiming to consolidate the state of the art in machine ethics prior to 2020, these tend to not include work that uses reinforcement learning agents as entities whose ethical behaviour is to be achieved. The reason for this is that only in the last years we have witnessed an increase in machine ethics studies within reinforcement learning. We present here a systematic review of reinforcement learning for machine ethics and machine ethics within reinforcement learning. Additionally, we highlight trends in terms of ethics specifications, components and frameworks of reinforcement learning, and environments used to result in ethical behaviour. Our systematic review aims to consolidate the work in machine ethics and reinforcement learning thus completing the gap in the state of the art machine ethics landscape</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a literature review of recent work in offline model-based reinforcement learning, a field that utilizes model-based approaches in offline reinforcement learning. The survey provides a brief overview of the concepts and recent developments in both offline reinforcement learning and model-based reinforcement learning, and discuss the intersection of the two fields. We then presents key relevant papers in the field of offline model-based reinforcement learning and discuss their methods, particularly their approaches in solving the issue of distributional shift, the main problem faced by all current offline model-based reinforcement learning methods.

The past decade's advances in rl have led to breakthroughs in many challenging domains such as video games, board games, robotics, and chip design. The sample inefficiency of deep reinforcement learning methods is a significant obstacle when applying rl to real-world problems. Transfer learning has been applied to reinforcement learning such that the knowledge gained in one task can be applied when training in a new task. Curriculum learning is concerned with sequencing tasks or data samples such that knowledge can be transferred between those tasks to learn a target task that would otherwise be too difficult to solve. Designing a curriculum that improves sample efficiency is a complex problem. In this thesis, we propose a teacher-student curriculum learning setting where we simultaneously train a teacher that selects tasks for the student while the student learns how to solve the selected task. Our method is independent of human domain knowledge and manual curriculum design. We evaluated our methods on two reinforcement learning benchmarks: grid world and the challenging Google Football environment. With our method, we can improve the sample efficiency and generality of the student compared to tabula-rasa reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Noise tolerance via reinforcement: Learning a reinforced quantum dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12418v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of quantum simulations heavily depends on the efficiency of noise mitigation techniques and error correction algorithms. Reinforcement has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the efficiency of learning and optimization algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that a reinforced quantum dynamics can exhibit significant robustness against interactions with a noisy environment. We study a quantum annealing process where, through reinforcement, the system is encouraged to maintain its current state or follow a noise-free evolution. A learning algorithm is employed to derive a concise approximation of this reinforced dynamics, reducing the total evolution time and, consequently, the system's exposure to noisy interactions. This also avoids the complexities associated with implementing quantum feedback in such reinforcement algorithms. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations of reinforced quantum annealing with one- and two-qubit systems under Pauli noise.</p></details> | 25 pages, 12 figures |

| **[Derivative-Free Reinforcement Learning: A Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05710v1)** | 2021-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning is about learning agent models that make the best sequential decisions in unknown environments. In an unknown environment, the agent needs to explore the environment while exploiting the collected information, which usually forms a sophisticated problem to solve. Derivative-free optimization, meanwhile, is capable of solving sophisticated problems. It commonly uses a sampling-and-updating framework to iteratively improve the solution, where exploration and exploitation are also needed to be well balanced. Therefore, derivative-free optimization deals with a similar core issue as reinforcement learning, and has been introduced in reinforcement learning approaches, under the names of learning classifier systems and neuroevolution/evolutionary reinforcement learning. Although such methods have been developed for decades, recently, derivative-free reinforcement learning exhibits attracting increasing attention. However, recent survey on this topic is still lacking. In this article, we summarize methods of derivative-free reinforcement learning to date, and organize the methods in aspects including parameter updating, model selection, exploration, and parallel/distributed methods. Moreover, we discuss some current limitations and possible future directions, hoping that this article could bring more attentions to this topic and serve as a catalyst for developing novel and efficient approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science in 2020</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Sustainable Energy: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18597v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transition to sustainable energy is a key challenge of our time, requiring modifications in the entire pipeline of energy production, storage, transmission, and consumption. At every stage, new sequential decision-making challenges emerge, ranging from the operation of wind farms to the management of electrical grids or the scheduling of electric vehicle charging stations. All such problems are well suited for reinforcement learning, the branch of machine learning that learns behavior from data. Therefore, numerous studies have explored the use of reinforcement learning for sustainable energy. This paper surveys this literature with the intention of bridging both the underlying research communities: energy and machine learning. After a brief introduction of both fields, we systematically list relevant sustainability challenges, how they can be modeled as a reinforcement learning problem, and what solution approaches currently exist in the literature. Afterwards, we zoom out and identify overarching reinforcement learning themes that appear throughout sustainability, such as multi-agent, offline, and safe reinforcement learning. Lastly, we also cover standardization of environments, which will be crucial for connecting both research fields, and highlight potential directions for future work. In summary, this survey provides an extensive overview of reinforcement learning methods for sustainable energy, which may play a vital role in the energy transition.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages excluding references, 40 pages including references, 7 images</p></details> |

| **[A Survey Analyzing Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02349v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning research obtained significant success and attention with the utilization of deep neural networks to solve problems in high dimensional state or action spaces. While deep reinforcement learning policies are currently being deployed in many different fields from medical applications to large language models, there are still ongoing questions the field is trying to answer on the generalization capabilities of deep reinforcement learning policies. In this paper, we will formalize and analyze generalization in deep reinforcement learning. We will explain the fundamental reasons why deep reinforcement learning policies encounter overfitting problems that limit their generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we will categorize and explain the manifold solution approaches to increase generalization, and overcome overfitting in deep reinforcement learning policies. From exploration to adversarial analysis and from regularization to robustness our paper provides an analysis on a wide range of subfields within deep reinforcement learning with a broad scope and in-depth view. We believe our study can provide a compact guideline for the current advancements in deep reinforcement learning, and help to construct robust deep neural policies with higher generalization skills.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performative Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00046v2)** | 2023-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the framework of performative reinforcement learning where the policy chosen by the learner affects the underlying reward and transition dynamics of the environment. Following the recent literature on performative prediction~\cite{Perdomo et. al., 2020}, we introduce the concept of performatively stable policy. We then consider a regularized version of the reinforcement learning problem and show that repeatedly optimizing this objective converges to a performatively stable policy under reasonable assumptions on the transition dynamics. Our proof utilizes the dual perspective of the reinforcement learning problem and may be of independent interest in analyzing the convergence of other algorithms with decision-dependent environments. We then extend our results for the setting where the learner just performs gradient ascent steps instead of fully optimizing the objective, and for the setting where the learner has access to a finite number of trajectories from the changed environment. For both settings, we leverage the dual formulation of performative reinforcement learning and establish convergence to a stable solution. Finally, through extensive experiments on a grid-world environment, we demonstrate the dependence of convergence on various parameters e.g. regularization, smoothness, and the number of samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive MCMC](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13574v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An informal observation, made by several authors, is that the adaptive design of a Markov transition kernel has the flavour of a reinforcement learning task. Yet, to-date it has remained unclear how to actually exploit modern reinforcement learning technologies for adaptive MCMC. The aim of this paper is to set out a general framework, called Reinforcement Learning Metropolis--Hastings, that is theoretically supported and empirically validated. Our principal focus is on learning fast-mixing Metropolis--Hastings transition kernels, which we cast as deterministic policies and optimise via a policy gradient. Control of the learning rate provably ensures conditions for ergodicity are satisfied. The methodology is used to construct a gradient-free sampler that out-performs a popular gradient-free adaptive Metropolis--Hastings algorithm on $\approx 90 \%$ of tasks in the PosteriorDB benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Such optimization problems may be amenable to reinforcement learning.

There has been a close link between theoretical advances in reinforcement learning and neuroscience experiments throughout this literature, and the theories describing the experimental data have therefore become increasingly complex.

However, a significant drawback persists: its poor data efficiency, stemming from its interactive nature. The training of reinforcement learning-based recommender systems demands expensive online interactions to amass adequate trajectories, essential for agents to learn user preferences. This inefficiency renders reinforcement learning-based recommender systems a formidable undertaking, necessitating the exploration of potential solutions. Recent strides in offline reinforcement learning present a new perspective. Offline reinforcement learning empowers agents to glean insights from offline datasets and deploy learned policies in online settings. Given that recommender systems possess extensive offline datasets, the framework of offline reinforcement learning aligns seamlessly. Despite being a burgeoning field, works centered on recommender systems utilizing offline reinforcement learning remain limited. This survey aims to introduce and delve into offline reinforcement learning within recommender systems, offering an inclusive review of existing literature in this domain. Furthermore, we strive to underscore prevalent challenges, opportunities, and future pathways, poised to propel research in this evolving field.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Contrastive Abstraction for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00704v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning agents with reinforcement learning is difficult when dealing with long trajectories that involve a large number of states. To address these learning problems effectively, the number of states can be reduced by abstract representations that cluster states. In principle, deep reinforcement learning can find abstract states, but end-to-end learning is unstable. We propose contrastive abstraction learning to find abstract states, where we assume that successive states in a trajectory belong to the same abstract state. Such abstract states may be basic locations, achieved subgoals, inventory, or health conditions. Contrastive abstraction learning first constructs clusters of state representations by contrastive learning and then applies modern Hopfield networks to determine the abstract states. The first phase of contrastive abstraction learning is self-supervised learning, where contrastive learning forces states with sequential proximity to have similar representations. The second phase uses modern Hopfield networks to map similar state representations to the same fixed point, i.e.\ to an abstract state. The level of abstraction can be adjusted by determining the number of fixed points of the modern Hopfield network. Furthermore, \textit{contrastive abstraction learning} does not require rewards and facilitates efficient reinforcement learning for a wide range of downstream tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of contrastive abstraction learning for reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Optimize for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01470v3)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, by leveraging more data, computation, and diverse tasks, learned optimizers have achieved remarkable success in supervised learning, outperforming classical hand-designed optimizers. Reinforcement learning (RL) is essentially different from supervised learning, and in practice, these learned optimizers do not work well even in simple RL tasks. We investigate this phenomenon and identify two issues. First, the agent-gradient distribution is non-independent and identically distributed, leading to inefficient meta-training. Moreover, due to highly stochastic agent-environment interactions, the agent-gradients have high bias and variance, which increases the difficulty of learning an optimizer for RL. We propose pipeline training and a novel optimizer structure with a good inductive bias to address these issues, making it possible to learn an optimizer for reinforcement learning from scratch. We show that, although only trained in toy tasks, our learned optimizer can generalize to unseen complex tasks in Brax.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at RLC 2024.

| **[Stochastic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04178v1)** | 2019-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reinforcement learning episodes, the rewards and punishments are often non-deterministic, and there are invariably stochastic elements governing the underlying situation. Such stochastic elements are often numerous and cannot be known in advance, and they have a tendency to obscure the underlying rewards and punishments patterns. Indeed, if stochastic elements were absent, the same outcome would occur every time and the learning problems involved could be greatly simplified. In addition, in most practical situations, the cost of an observation to receive either a reward or punishment can be significant, and one would wish to arrive at the correct learning conclusion by incurring minimum cost. In this paper, we present a stochastic approach to reinforcement learning which explicitly models the variability present in the learning environment and the cost of observation. Criteria and rules for learning success are quantitatively analyzed, and probabilities of exceeding the observation cost bounds are also obtained.</p></details> | AIKE 2018 |
| **[Why Online Reinforcement Learning is Causal](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04221v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) and causal modelling naturally complement each other. The goal of causal modelling is to predict the effects of interventions in an environment, while the goal of reinforcement learning is to select interventions that maximize the rewards the agent receives from the environment. Reinforcement learning includes the two most powerful sources of information for estimating causal relationships: temporal ordering and the ability to act on an environment. This paper examines which reinforcement learning settings we can expect to benefit from causal modelling, and how. In online learning, the agent has the ability to interact directly with their environment, and learn from exploring it. Our main argument is that in online learning, conditional probabilities are causal, and therefore offline RL is the setting where causal learning has the most potential to make a difference. Essentially, the reason is that when an agent learns from their {\em own} experience, there are no unobserved confounders that influence both the agent's own exploratory actions and the rewards they receive. Our paper formalizes this argument. For offline RL, where an agent may and typically does learn from the experience of {\em others}, we describe previous and new methods for leveraging a causal model, including support for counterfactual queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages.

| **[Maximum diffusion reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15293v5)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots and animals both experience the world through their bodies and senses. Their embodiment constrains their experiences, ensuring they unfold continuously in space and time. As a result, the experiences of embodied agents are intrinsically correlated. Correlations create fundamental challenges for machine learning, as most techniques rely on the assumption that data are independent and identically distributed. In reinforcement learning, where data are directly collected from an agent's sequential experiences, violations of this assumption are often unavoidable. Here, we derive a method that overcomes this issue by exploiting the statistical mechanics of ergodic processes, which we term maximum diffusion reinforcement learning. By decorrelating agent experiences, our approach provably enables single-shot learning in continuous deployments over the course of individual task attempts. Moreover, we prove our approach generalizes well-known maximum entropy techniques, and robustly exceeds state-of-the-art performance across popular benchmarks. Our results at the nexus of physics, learning, and control form a foundation for transparent and reliable decision-making in embodied reinforcement learning agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>The P...</summary><p>The PDF file contains the collated main text and supplementary information.

However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm, based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A shorter version of this paper appeared in the Proceedings of the Thirty-Sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-22).

Model-based algorithms promise sample efficiency by building an environment model that can be used for planning. Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning is such a model-based algorithm that has attracted significant interest due to its performance in the tabular setting. This paper introduces Posterior Sampling for Deep Reinforcement Learning (PSDRL), the first truly scalable approximation of Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning that retains its model-based essence. PSDRL combines efficient uncertainty quantification over latent state space models with a specially tailored continual planning algorithm based on value-function approximation. Extensive experiments on the Atari benchmark show that PSDRL significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art attempts at scaling up posterior sampling while being competitive with a state-of-the-art (model-based) reinforcement learning method, both in sample efficiency and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Teach Reinforcement Learning Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.09079v1)** | 2017-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article we study the transfer learning model of action advice under a budget. We focus on reinforcement learning teachers providing action advice to heterogeneous students playing the game of Pac-Man under a limited advice budget. First, we examine several critical factors affecting advice quality in this setting, such as the average performance of the teacher, its variance and the importance of reward discounting in advising. The experiments show the non-trivial importance of the coefficient of variation (CV) as a statistic for choosing policies that generate advice. The CV statistic relates variance to the corresponding mean. Second, the article studies policy learning for distributing advice under a budget. Whereas most methods in the relevant literature rely on heuristics for advice distribution we formulate the problem as a learning one and propose a novel RL algorithm capable of learning when to advise, adapting to the student and the task at hand. Furthermore, we argue that learning to advise under a budget is an instance of a more generic learning problem: Constrained Exploitation Reinforcement Learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement learning with world model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.11494v4)** | 2020-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have achieved remarkable performance on many decision making and control tasks, but high sample complexity and low sample efficiency still hinder the wide use of model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. In this paper, we argue that if we intend to design an intelligent agent that learns fast and transfers well, the agent must be able to reflect key elements of intelligence, like intuition, Memory, PredictionandCuriosity. We propose an agent framework that integrates off-policy reinforcement learning with world model learning, so as to embody the important features of intelligence in our algorithm design. We adopt the state-of-art model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, Soft Actor-Critic, as the agent intuition, and world model learning through RNN to endow the agent with memory, curiosity, and the ability to predict. We show that these ideas can work collaboratively with each other and our agent (RMC) can give new state-of-art results while maintaining sample efficiency and training stability. Moreover, our agent framework can be easily extended from MDP to POMDP problems without performance loss.</p></details> |  |

However, the computational cost of reinforcement learning with deep neural networks is extremely high and reducing the learning cost is a challenging issue. We propose a photonic on-line implementation of reinforcement learning using optoelectronic delay-based reservoir computing, both experimentally and numerically. In the proposed scheme, we accelerate reinforcement learning at a rate of several megahertz because there is no required learning process for the internal connection weights in reservoir computing. We perform two benchmark tasks, CartPole-v0 and MountanCar-v0 tasks, to evaluate the proposed scheme. Our results represent the first hardware implementation of reinforcement learning based on photonic reservoir computing and pave the way for fast and efficient reinforcement learning as a novel photonic accelerator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformer Based Reinforcement Learning For Games](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.03918v1)** | 2019-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent times have witnessed sharp improvements in reinforcement learning tasks using deep reinforcement learning techniques like Deep Q Networks, Policy Gradients, Actor Critic methods which are based on deep learning based models and back-propagation of gradients to train such models. An active area of research in reinforcement learning is about training agents to play complex video games, which so far has been something accomplished only by human intelligence. Some state of the art performances in video game playing using deep reinforcement learning are obtained by processing the sequence of frames from video games, passing them through a convolutional network to obtain features and then using recurrent neural networks to figure out the action leading to optimal rewards. The recurrent neural network will learn to extract the meaningful signal out of the sequence of such features. In this work, we propose a method utilizing a transformer network which have recently replaced RNNs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and perform experiments to compare with existing methods.</p></details> | 4 pages |
| **[Active Hierarchical Imitation and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07330v1)** | 2020-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can leverage hierarchical structures to split a task into sub-tasks and solve problems efficiently. Both imitation and reinforcement learning or a combination of them with hierarchical structures have been proven to be an efficient way for robots to learn complex tasks with sparse rewards. However, in the previous work of hierarchical imitation and reinforcement learning, the tested environments are in relatively simple 2D games, and the action spaces are discrete. Furthermore, many imitation learning works focusing on improving the policies learned from the expert polices that are hard-coded or trained by reinforcement learning algorithms, rather than human experts. In the scenarios of human-robot interaction, humans can be required to provide demonstrations to teach the robot, so it is crucial to improve the learning efficiency to reduce expert efforts, and know human's perception about the learning/training process. In this project, we explored different imitation learning algorithms and designed active learning algorithms upon the hierarchical imitation and reinforcement learning framework we have developed. We performed an experiment where five participants were asked to guide a randomly initialized agent to a random goal in a maze. Our experimental results showed that using DAgger and reward-based active learning method can achieve better performance while saving more human efforts physically and mentally during the training process.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

Consequently, in this study, we identify three main environment types and classify reinforcement learning algorithms according to those environment types. Moreover, within each category, we identify relationships between algorithms. The overview of each algorithm provides insight into the algorithms' foundations and reviews similarities and differences among algorithms. This study provides a perspective on the field and helps practitioners and researchers to select the appropriate algorithm for their use case.</p></details> |  |

Neural networks are used to learn from a demonstrated expert policy and are evolved to generate a policy similar to the demonstration. The algorithm is discussed and evaluated against competitive feature-based Inverse Reinforcement Learning approaches. At the cost of execution time, neural networks allow for non-linear combinations of features in state evaluations. These valuations may correspond to state value or state reward. This results in better correspondence to observed examples as opposed to using linear combinations. This work also extends existing work on Bayesian Non-Parametric Feature Construction for Inverse Reinforcement Learning by using non-linear combinations of intermediate data to improve performance. The algorithm is observed to be specifically suitable for a linearly solvable non-deterministic Markov Decision Processes in which multiple rewards are sparsely scattered in state space. A conclusive performance hierarchy between evaluated algorithms is presented.</p></details> | 12 pages, 15 figures |

We combine symbolic methods with machine learning, in what is referred to as a neuro-symbolic system. The agents are not restricted to only use initial primitives: reinforcement learning is interleaved with steps to extend the current language with novel higher-level concepts, allowing generalisation and more informative communication via shorter messages. We demonstrate that this approach allow agents to converge more quickly on a small collaborative construction task.</p></details> | <details><summary>AIC 2...</summary><p>AIC 2022, 8th International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Cognition</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06869v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in sequential decision-making tasks across diverse domains, yet its reliance on black-box neural architectures hinders interpretability, trust, and deployment in high-stakes applications. Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL) addresses these challenges by enhancing transparency through feature-level, state-level, dataset-level, and model-level explanation techniques. This survey provides a comprehensive review of XRL methods, evaluates their qualitative and quantitative assessment frameworks, and explores their role in policy refinement, adversarial robustness, and security. Additionally, we examine the integration of reinforcement learning with Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which optimizes AI alignment with human preferences. We conclude by highlighting open research challenges and future directions to advance the development of interpretable, reliable, and accountable DRL systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Distributional Perspective on Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06887v1)** | 2017-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we argue for the fundamental importance of the value distribution: the distribution of the random return received by a reinforcement learning agent. This is in contrast to the common approach to reinforcement learning which models the expectation of this return, or value. Although there is an established body of literature studying the value distribution, thus far it has always been used for a specific purpose such as implementing risk-aware behaviour. We begin with theoretical results in both the policy evaluation and control settings, exposing a significant distributional instability in the latter. We then use the distributional perspective to design a new algorithm which applies Bellman's equation to the learning of approximate value distributions. We evaluate our algorithm using the suite of games from the Arcade Learning Environment. We obtain both state-of-the-art results and anecdotal evidence demonstrating the importance of the value distribution in approximate reinforcement learning. Finally, we combine theoretical and empirical evidence to highlight the ways in which the value distribution impacts learning in the approximate setting.</p></details> | ICML 2017 |
| **[Three Dogmas of Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10583v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern reinforcement learning has been conditioned by at least three dogmas. The first is the environment spotlight, which refers to our tendency to focus on modeling environments rather than agents. The second is our treatment of learning as finding the solution to a task, rather than adaptation. The third is the reward hypothesis, which states that all goals and purposes can be well thought of as maximization of a reward signal. These three dogmas shape much of what we think of as the science of reinforcement learning. While each of the dogmas have played an important role in developing the field, it is time we bring them to the surface and reflect on whether they belong as basic ingredients of our scientific paradigm. In order to realize the potential of reinforcement learning as a canonical frame for researching intelligent agents, we suggest that it is time we shed dogmas one and two entirely, and embrace a nuanced approach to the third.</p></details> | RLC 2024 |

This paper presents RAMP, a Reinforcement learning Agent using Model Parameters that utilizes the idea that a neural network trained to predict environment dynamics encapsulates the environment information. RAMP is constructed in two phases: in the first phase, a multi-environment parameterized dynamic model is learned. In the second phase, the model parameters of the dynamic model are used as context for the multi-environment policy of the model-free reinforcement learning agent.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Impressive results were achieved in activities as diverse as autonomous driving, game playing, molecular recombination, and robotics. In all these fields, computer programs have taught themselves to solve difficult problems. They have learned to fly model helicopters and perform aerobatic manoeuvers such as loops and rolls. In some applications they have even become better than the best humans, such as in Atari, Go, poker and StarCraft. The way in which deep reinforcement learning explores complex environments reminds us of how children learn, by playfully trying out things, getting feedback, and trying again. The computer seems to truly possess aspects of human learning; this goes to the heart of the dream of artificial intelligence. The successes in research have not gone unnoticed by educators, and universities have started to offer courses on the subject. The aim of this book is to provide a comprehensive overview of the field of deep reinforcement learning. The book is written for graduate students of artificial intelligence, and for researchers and practitioners who wish to better understand deep reinforcement learning methods and their challenges. We assume an undergraduate-level of understanding of computer science and artificial intelligence; the programming language of this book is Python. We describe the foundations, the algorithms and the applications of deep reinforcement learning. We cover the established model-free and model-based methods that form the basis of the field. Developments go quickly, and we also cover advanced topics: deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, deep hierarchical reinforcement learning, and deep meta learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version 2023, added description of Monte Carlo sampling and N-step algorithm, improved explanation of on-policy and off-policy learning.

The reliance on absolute or deterministic reward as a metric for optimization process renders reinforcement learning highly susceptible to changes in problem dynamics. We introduce a novel framework that effectively quantizes the uncertainty of the design space and induces robustness in controllers by switching to a reliability-based optimization routine. The data efficiency of the method is maintained to match reward based optimization methods by employing a model-based approach. We prove the stability of learned neuro-controllers in both static and dynamic environments on classical reinforcement learning tasks such as Cart Pole balancing and Inverted Pendulum.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

This work explores the potential for quantum computing to facilitate reinforcement learning problems. Quantum computing approaches offer important potential improvements in time and space complexity over traditional algorithms because of its ability to exploit the quantum phenomena of superposition and entanglement. Specifically, we investigate the use of quantum variational circuits, a form of quantum machine learning. We present our techniques for encoding classical data for a quantum variational circuit, we further explore pure and hybrid quantum algorithms for DQN and Double DQN. Our results indicate both hybrid and pure quantum variational circuit have the ability to solve reinforcement learning tasks with a smaller parameter space. These comparison are conducted with two OpenAI Gym environments: CartPole and Blackjack, The success of this work is indicative of a strong future relationship between quantum machine learning and deep reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AIIDE 2020 Updated to better reflect AAAI formatting</p></details> |

| **[EVO-RL: Evolutionary-Driven Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04725v2)** | 2020-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a novel approach for reinforcement learning driven by evolutionary computation. Our algorithm, dubbed as Evolutionary-Driven Reinforcement Learning (evo-RL), embeds the reinforcement learning algorithm in an evolutionary cycle, where we distinctly differentiate between purely evolvable (instinctive) behaviour versus purely learnable behaviour. Furthermore, we propose that this distinction is decided by the evolutionary process, thus allowing evo-RL to be adaptive to different environments. In addition, evo-RL facilitates learning on environments with rewardless states, which makes it more suited for real-world problems with incomplete information. To show that evo-RL leads to state-of-the-art performance, we present the performance of different state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms when operating within evo-RL and compare it with the case when these same algorithms are executed independently. Results show that reinforcement learning algorithms embedded within our evo-RL approach significantly outperform the stand-alone versions of the same RL algorithms on OpenAI Gym control problems with rewardless states constrained by the same computational budget.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Inverse Reinforcement Learning without Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.14623v4)** | 2024-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is a powerful set of techniques for imitation learning that aims to learn a reward function that rationalizes expert demonstrations. Unfortunately, traditional IRL methods suffer from a computational weakness: they require repeatedly solving a hard reinforcement learning (RL) problem as a subroutine. This is counter-intuitive from the viewpoint of reductions: we have reduced the easier problem of imitation learning to repeatedly solving the harder problem of RL. Another thread of work has proved that access to the side-information of the distribution of states where a strong policy spends time can dramatically reduce the sample and computational complexities of solving an RL problem. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a more informed imitation learning reduction where we utilize the state distribution of the expert to alleviate the global exploration component of the RL subroutine, providing an exponential speedup in theory. In practice, we find that we are able to significantly speed up the prior art on continuous control tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, some agents can solve new tasks without updating any parameters by simply conditioning on additional context such as their action-observation histories. This paper surveys work on such behavior, known as in-context reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore this concept further by using group-aided training within the distributional reinforcement learning paradigm. Specifically, we propose an extension to categorical reinforcement learning, where distributional learning targets are implicitly based on the total information gathered by an ensemble. We empirically show that this may lead to much more robust initial learning, a stronger individual performance level, and good efficiency on a per-sample basis.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Topological Foundations of Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03706v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of this work is to serve as a foundation for deep studies of the topology of state, action, and policy spaces in reinforcement learning. By studying these spaces from a mathematical perspective, we expect to gain more insight into how to build better algorithms to solve decision problems. Therefore, we focus on presenting the connection between the Banach fixed point theorem and the convergence of reinforcement learning algorithms, and we illustrate how the insights gained from this can practically help in designing more efficient algorithms. Before doing so, however, we first introduce relevant concepts such as metric spaces, normed spaces and Banach spaces for better understanding, before expressing the entire reinforcement learning problem in terms of Markov decision processes. This allows us to properly introduce the Banach contraction principle in a language suitable for reinforcement learning, and to write the Bellman equations in terms of operators on Banach spaces to show why reinforcement learning algorithms converge. Finally, we show how the insights gained from the mathematical study of convergence are helpful in reasoning about the best ways to make reinforcement learning algorithms more efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Super...</summary><p>Supervisor : Yae Ulrich Gaba , Mentor : Domini Jocema Leko</p></details> |
| **[An Analysis of Categorical Distributional Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08163v1)** | 2018-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributional approaches to value-based reinforcement learning model the entire distribution of returns, rather than just their expected values, and have recently been shown to yield state-of-the-art empirical performance. This was demonstrated by the recently proposed C51 algorithm, based on categorical distributional reinforcement learning (CDRL) [Bellemare et al., 2017]. However, the theoretical properties of CDRL algorithms are not yet well understood. In this paper, we introduce a framework to analyse CDRL algorithms, establish the importance of the projected distributional Bellman operator in distributional RL, draw fundamental connections between CDRL and the Cramér distance, and give a proof of convergence for sample-based categorical distributional reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |

| **[Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Abductive Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10792v1)** | 2018-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key challenges in applying reinforcement learning to real-life problems is that the amount of train-and-error required to learn a good policy increases drastically as the task becomes complex. One potential solution to this problem is to combine reinforcement learning with automated symbol planning and utilize prior knowledge on the domain. However, existing methods have limitations in their applicability and expressiveness. In this paper we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning method based on abductive symbolic planning. The planner can deal with user-defined evaluation functions and is not based on the Herbrand theorem. Therefore it can utilize prior knowledge of the rewards and can work in a domain where the state space is unknown. We demonstrate empirically that our architecture significantly improves learning efficiency with respect to the amount of training examples on the evaluation domain, in which the state space is unknown and there exist multiple goals.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, ICML/IJCAI/AAMAS 2018 Workshop on Planning and Learning (PAL-18)</p></details> |
| **[Data Valuation for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09550v1)** | 2022-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) hinges on the availability of training data, which is typically obtained via a large number of environment interactions. In many real-world scenarios, costs and risks are associated with gathering these data. The field of offline reinforcement learning addresses these issues through outsourcing the collection of data to a domain expert or a carefully monitored program and subsequently searching for a batch-constrained optimal policy. With the emergence of data markets, an alternative to constructing a dataset in-house is to purchase external data. However, while state-of-the-art offline reinforcement learning approaches have shown a lot of promise, they currently rely on carefully constructed datasets that are well aligned with the intended target domains. This raises questions regarding the transferability and robustness of an offline reinforcement learning agent trained on externally acquired data. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the ability of the current state-of-the-art offline reinforcement learning approaches to coping with the source-target domain mismatch within two MuJoCo environments, finding that current state-of-the-art offline reinforcement learning algorithms underperform in the target domain. To address this, we propose data valuation for offline reinforcement learning (DVORL), which allows us to identify relevant and high-quality transitions, improving the performance and transferability of policies learned by offline reinforcement learning algorithms. The results show that our method outperforms offline reinforcement learning baselines on two MuJoCo environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Particularly, it is a recurring theme in Reinforcement Learning research, where forward models approximate the state transition function of a Markov Decision Process by learning a mapping function from current state and action to the next state. This problem is commonly defined as a Supervised Learning problem in a direct way. This common approach faces several difficulties due to the inherent complexities of the dynamics to learn, for example, delayed effects, high non-linearity, non-stationarity, partial observability and, more important, error accumulation when using bootstrapped predictions (predictions based on past predictions), over large time horizons. Here we explore the use of Reinforcement Learning in this problem. We elaborate on why and how this problem fits naturally and sound as a Reinforcement Learning problem, and present some experimental results that demonstrate RL is a promising technique to solve these kind of problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Neurips Deep Reinforcement Learning Workshop 2022: https://openreview.net/forum?id=fGcbpWQIJZV</p></details> |
| **[A Unifying Framework for Reinforcement Learning and Planning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15009v4)** | 2022-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential decision making, commonly formalized as optimization of a Markov Decision Process, is a key challenge in artificial intelligence. Two successful approaches to MDP optimization are reinforcement learning and planning, which both largely have their own research communities. However, if both research fields solve the same problem, then we might be able to disentangle the common factors in their solution approaches. Therefore, this paper presents a unifying algorithmic framework for reinforcement learning and planning (FRAP), which identifies underlying dimensions on which MDP planning and learning algorithms have to decide. At the end of the paper, we compare a variety of well-known planning, model-free and model-based RL algorithms along these dimensions. Altogether, the framework may help provide deeper insight in the algorithmic design space of planning and reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLIF: Interactive Imitation Learning as Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.12996v2)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although reinforcement learning methods offer a powerful framework for automatic skill acquisition, for practical learning-based control problems in domains such as robotics, imitation learning often provides a more convenient and accessible alternative. In particular, an interactive imitation learning method such as DAgger, which queries a near-optimal expert to intervene online to collect correction data for addressing the distributional shift challenges that afflict naïve behavioral cloning, can enjoy good performance both in theory and practice without requiring manually specified reward functions and other components of full reinforcement learning methods. In this paper, we explore how off-policy reinforcement learning can enable improved performance under assumptions that are similar but potentially even more practical than those of interactive imitation learning. Our proposed method uses reinforcement learning with user intervention signals themselves as rewards. This relaxes the assumption that intervening experts in interactive imitation learning should be near-optimal and enables the algorithm to learn behaviors that improve over the potential suboptimal human expert. We also provide a unified framework to analyze our RL method and DAgger; for which we present the asymptotic analysis of the suboptimal gap for both methods as well as the non-asymptotic sample complexity bound of our method. We then evaluate our method on challenging high-dimensional continuous control simulation benchmarks as well as real-world robotic vision-based manipulation tasks. The results show that it strongly outperforms DAgger-like approaches across the different tasks, especially when the intervening experts are suboptimal.

| **[Curriculum Learning for Reinforcement Learning Domains: A Framework and Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04960v2)** | 2020-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular paradigm for addressing sequential decision tasks in which the agent has only limited environmental feedback. Despite many advances over the past three decades, learning in many domains still requires a large amount of interaction with the environment, which can be prohibitively expensive in realistic scenarios. To address this problem, transfer learning has been applied to reinforcement learning such that experience gained in one task can be leveraged when starting to learn the next, harder task. More recently, several lines of research have explored how tasks, or data samples themselves, can be sequenced into a curriculum for the purpose of learning a problem that may otherwise be too difficult to learn from scratch. In this article, we present a framework for curriculum learning (CL) in reinforcement learning, and use it to survey and classify existing CL methods in terms of their assumptions, capabilities, and goals. Finally, we use our framework to find open problems and suggest directions for future RL curriculum learning research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to drive via Apprenticeship Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.03864v1)** | 2020-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the implementation of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, current state-of-art autonomous vehicle technology have the potential to get closer to full automation. However, most of the applications have been limited to game domains or discrete action space which are far from the real world driving. Moreover, it is very tough to tune the parameters of reward mechanism since the driving styles vary a lot among the different users. For instance, an aggressive driver may prefer driving with high acceleration whereas some conservative drivers prefer a safer driving style. Therefore, we propose an apprenticeship learning in combination with deep reinforcement learning approach that allows the agent to learn the driving and stopping behaviors with continuous actions. We use gradient inverse reinforcement learning (GIRL) algorithm to recover the unknown reward function and employ REINFORCE as well as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG) to learn the optimal policy. The performance of our method is evaluated in simulation-based scenario and the results demonstrate that the agent performs human like driving and even better in some aspects after training.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 11 figures, conference</p></details> |

| **[Dealing with Sparse Rewards in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.09281v2)** | 2019-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Successfully navigating a complex environment to obtain a desired outcome is a difficult task, that up to recently was believed to be capable only by humans. This perception has been broken down over time, especially with the introduction of deep reinforcement learning, which has greatly increased the difficulty of tasks that can be automated. However, for traditional reinforcement learning agents this requires an environment to be able to provide frequent extrinsic rewards, which are not known or accessible for many real-world environments. This project aims to explore and contrast existing reinforcement learning solutions that circumnavigate the difficulties of an environment that provide sparse rewards. Different reinforcement solutions will be implemented over a several video game environments with varying difficulty and varying frequency of rewards, as to properly investigate the applicability of these solutions. This project introduces a novel reinforcement learning solution by combining aspects of two existing state of the art sparse reward solutions, curiosity driven exploration and unsupervised auxiliary tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Robotic Model of Hippocampal Reverse Replay for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11914v1)** | 2021-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hippocampal reverse replay is thought to contribute to learning, and particularly reinforcement learning, in animals. We present a computational model of learning in the hippocampus that builds on a previous model of the hippocampal-striatal network viewed as implementing a three-factor reinforcement learning rule. To augment this model with hippocampal reverse replay, a novel policy gradient learning rule is derived that associates place cell activity with responses in cells representing actions. This new model is evaluated using a simulated robot spatial navigation task inspired by the Morris water maze. Results show that reverse replay can accelerate learning from reinforcement, whilst improving stability and robustness over multiple trials. As implied by the neurobiological data, our study implies that reverse replay can make a significant positive contribution to reinforcement learning, although learning that is less efficient and less stable is possible in its absence. We conclude that reverse replay may enhance reinforcement learning in the mammalian hippocampal-striatal system rather than provide its core mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, journal, submitted to Bioinspiration and Biomimetics</p></details> |

Despite its reputation, data inefficiency caused by its trial and error learning mechanism makes deep reinforcement learning hard to be practical in a wide range of areas. Plenty of methods have been developed for sample efficient deep reinforcement learning, such as environment modeling, experience transfer, and distributed modifications, amongst which, distributed deep reinforcement learning has shown its potential in various applications, such as human-computer gaming, and intelligent transportation. In this paper, we conclude the state of this exciting field, by comparing the classical distributed deep reinforcement learning methods, and studying important components to achieve efficient distributed learning, covering single player single agent distributed deep reinforcement learning to the most complex multiple players multiple agents distributed deep reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we review recently released toolboxes that help to realize distributed deep reinforcement learning without many modifications of their non-distributed versions. By analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, a multi-player multi-agent distributed deep reinforcement learning toolbox is developed and released, which is further validated on Wargame, a complex environment, showing usability of the proposed toolbox for multiple players and multiple agents distributed deep reinforcement learning under complex games. Finally, we try to point out challenges and future trends, hoping this brief review can provide a guide or a spark for researchers who are interested in distributed deep reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 14 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Pearl: Parallel Evolutionary and Reinforcement Learning Library](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.09568v1)** | 2022-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning is increasingly finding success across domains where the problem can be represented as a Markov decision process. Evolutionary computation algorithms have also proven successful in this domain, exhibiting similar performance to the generally more complex reinforcement learning. Whilst there exist many open-source reinforcement learning and evolutionary computation libraries, no publicly available library combines the two approaches for enhanced comparison, cooperation, or visualization. To this end, we have created Pearl (https://github.com/LondonNode/Pearl), an open source Python library designed to allow researchers to rapidly and conveniently perform optimized reinforcement learning, evolutionary computation and combinations of the two. The key features within Pearl include: modular and expandable components, opinionated module settings, Tensorboard integration, custom callbacks and comprehensive visualizations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A framework for online, stabilizing reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08730v9)** | 2022-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online reinforcement learning is concerned with training an agent on-the-fly via dynamic interaction with the environment. Here, due to the specifics of the application, it is not generally possible to perform long pre-training, as it is commonly done in off-line, model-free approaches, which are akin to dynamic programming. Such applications may be found more frequently in industry, rather than in pure digital fields, such as cloud services, video games, database management, etc., where reinforcement learning has been demonstrating success. Online reinforcement learning, in contrast, is more akin to classical control, which utilizes some model knowledge about the environment. Stability of the closed-loop (agent plus the environment) is a major challenge for such online approaches. In this paper, we tackle this problem by a special fusion of online reinforcement learning with elements of classical control, namely, based on the Lyapunov theory of stability. The idea is to start the agent at once, without pre-training, and learn approximately optimal policy under specially designed constraints, which guarantee stability. The resulting approach was tested in an extensive experimental study with a mobile robot. A nominal parking controller was used as a baseline. It was observed that the suggested agent could always successfully park the robot, while significantly improving the cost. While many approaches may be exploited for mobile robot control, we suggest that the experiments showed the promising potential of online reinforcement learning agents based on Lyapunov-like constraints. The presented methodology may be utilized in safety-critical, industrial applications where stability is necessary.</p></details> |  |

An alternative way of training an artificial neural network is through treating each unit in the network as a reinforcement learning agent, and thus the network is considered as a team of agents. As such, all units can be trained by REINFORCE, a local learning rule modulated by a global signal that is more consistent with biologically observed forms of synaptic plasticity. Although this learning rule follows the gradient of return in expectation, it suffers from high variance and thus the low speed of learning, rendering it impractical to train deep networks. We therefore propose a novel algorithm called MAP propagation to reduce this variance significantly while retaining the local property of the learning rule. Experiments demonstrated that MAP propagation could solve common reinforcement learning tasks at a similar speed to backpropagation when applied to an actor-critic network. Our work thus allows for the broader application of the teams of agents in deep reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

These successes have been facilitated by advances in algorithms (e.g., deep Q-learning, deep deterministic policy gradients, proximal policy optimisation, trust region policy optimisation, and soft actor-critic) and specialised computational resources such as GPUs and TPUs. One promising research direction involves introducing goals to allow multimodal policies, commonly through hierarchical or curriculum reinforcement learning. These methods systematically decompose complex behaviours into simpler sub-tasks, analogous to how humans progressively learn skills (e.g. we learn to run before we walk, or we learn arithmetic before calculus). However, fully automating goal creation remains an open challenge. We present a novel probabilistic curriculum learning algorithm to suggest goals for reinforcement learning agents in continuous control and navigation tasks.</p></details> |  |

The resulting agents perform differently and their characteristics depend on those of the underlying learning approach. Here, we consider a benchmark planning problem from the reinforcement learning domain, the Racetrack, to investigate the properties of agents derived from different deep (reinforcement) learning approaches. We compare the performance of deep supervised learning, in particular imitation learning, to reinforcement learning for the Racetrack model. We find that imitation learning yields agents that follow more risky paths. In contrast, the decisions of deep reinforcement learning are more foresighted, i.e., avoid states in which fatal decisions are more likely. Our evaluations show that for this sequential decision making problem, deep reinforcement learning performs best in many aspects even though for imitation learning optimal decisions are considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended Version of the Conference Paper published in the Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Quantitative Evaluation of SysTems (QEST)</p></details> |

| **[Reinforcement Learning for Control of Valves](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14668v2)** | 2021-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is a study of reinforcement learning (RL) as an optimal-control strategy for control of nonlinear valves. It is evaluated against the PID (proportional-integral-derivative) strategy, using a unified framework. RL is an autonomous learning mechanism that learns by interacting with its environment. It is gaining increasing attention in the world of control systems as a means of building optimal-controllers for challenging dynamic and nonlinear processes. Published RL research often uses open-source tools (Python and OpenAI Gym environments). We use MATLAB's recently launched (R2019a) Reinforcement Learning Toolbox to develop the valve controller; trained using the DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy-Gradient) algorithm and Simulink to simulate the nonlinear valve and create the experimental test-bench for evaluation. Simulink allows industrial engineers to quickly adapt and experiment with other systems of their choice. Results indicate that the RL controller is extremely good at tracking the signal with speed and produces a lower error with respect to the reference signal. The PID, however, is better at disturbance rejection and hence provides a longer life for the valves. Successful machine learning involves tuning many hyperparameters requiring significant investment of time and efforts. We introduce "Graded Learning" as a simplified, application oriented adaptation of the more formal and algorithmic "Curriculum for Reinforcement Learning". It is shown via experiments that it helps converge the learning task of complex non-linear real world systems. Finally, experiential learnings gained from this research are corroborated against published research.</p></details> | 20 pages, 75 figures |

While numerous studies have addressed the issue of intelligent traffic systems in the context of various disturbances, traffic signal malfunction, a common real-world occurrence with significant repercussions, has received comparatively limited attention. The primary objective of this research is to mitigate the adverse effects of traffic signal malfunction, such as traffic congestion and collision, by optimizing the control of neighboring functioning signals. To achieve this goal, this paper presents a novel traffic signal control framework (MalLight), which leverages an Influence-aware State Aggregation Module (ISAM) and an Influence-aware Reward Aggregation Module (IRAM) to achieve coordinated control of surrounding traffic signals. To the best of our knowledge, this study pioneers the application of a Reinforcement Learning(RL)-based approach to address the challenges posed by traffic signal malfunction. Empirical investigations conducted on real-world datasets substantiate the superior performance of our proposed methodology over conventional and deep learning-based alternatives in the presence of signal malfunction, with reduction of throughput alleviated by as much as 48.6$\%$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to CIKM24 Full Research track</p></details> |
| **[Economic-Driven Adaptive Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.00645v1)** | 2022-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emerging connected-vehicle technologies and smart roads, the need for intelligent adaptive traffic signal controls is more than ever before. This paper proposes a novel Economic-driven Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (eATSC) model with a hyper control variable - interest rate defined in economics for traffic signal control at signalized intersections. The eATSC uses a continuous compounding function that captures both the total number of vehicles and the accumulated waiting time of each vehicle to compute penalties for different directions. The computed penalties grow with waiting time and is used for signal control decisions. Each intersection is assigned two intelligent agents adjusting interest rate and signal length for different directions according to the traffic patterns, respectively. The problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem to reduce congestions, and a two-agent Double Dueling Deep Q Network (DDDQN) is utilized to solve the problem. Under the optimal policy, the agents can select the optimal interest rates and signal time to minimize the likelihood of traffic congestion. To evaluate the superiority of our method, a VISSIM simulation model with classic four-leg signalized intersections is developed. The results indicate that the proposed model is adequately able to maintain healthy traffic flow at the intersection.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures, presented at the Transportation Research Board (TRB) 100th Annual Meeting, 2021</p></details> |
| **[Diagnosing Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04716v1)** | 2019-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of traffic data and advance of deep reinforcement learning techniques, there is an emerging trend of employing reinforcement learning (RL) for traffic signal control. A key question for applying RL to traffic signal control is how to define the reward and state. The ultimate objective in traffic signal control is to minimize the travel time, which is difficult to reach directly. Hence, existing studies often define reward as an ad-hoc weighted linear combination of several traffic measures. However, there is no guarantee that the travel time will be optimized with the reward. In addition, recent RL approaches use more complicated state (e.g., image) in order to describe the full traffic situation. However, none of the existing studies has discussed whether such a complex state representation is necessary. This extra complexity may lead to significantly slower learning process but may not necessarily bring significant performance gain. In this paper, we propose to re-examine the RL approaches through the lens of classic transportation theory. We ask the following questions: (1) How should we design the reward so that one can guarantee to minimize the travel time? (2) How to design a state representation which is concise yet sufficient to obtain the optimal solution? Our proposed method LIT is theoretically supported by the classic traffic signal control methods in transportation field. LIT has a very simple state and reward design, thus can serve as a building block for future RL approaches to traffic signal control. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art traffic signal control methods.</p></details> |  |

| **[Random Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05961v1)** | 2022-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control is a significant part of the construction of intelligent transportation. An efficient traffic signal control strategy can reduce traffic congestion, improve urban road traffic efficiency and facilitate people's lives. Existing reinforcement learning approaches for traffic signal control mainly focus on learning through a separate neural network. Such an independent neural network may fall into the local optimum of the training results. Worse more, the collected data can only be sampled once, so the data utilization rate is low. Therefore, we propose the Random Ensemble Double DQN Light (RELight) model. It can dynamically learn traffic signal control strategies through reinforcement learning and combine random ensemble learning to avoid falling into the local optimum to reach the optimal strategy. Moreover, we introduce the Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio to control the number of data reuses to improve the problem of low data utilization. In addition, we have conducted sufficient experiments on synthetic data and real-world data to prove that our proposed method can achieve better traffic signal control effects than the existing optimal methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.06294v1)** | 2019-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many existing traffic signal controllers are either simple adaptive controllers based on sensors placed around traffic intersections, or optimized by traffic engineers on a fixed schedule. Optimizing traffic controllers is time consuming and usually require experienced traffic engineers. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in this context. However, most of the studies do not consider realistic settings that could seamlessly transition into deployment. In this paper, we propose a DRL-based adaptive traffic signal control framework that explicitly considers realistic traffic scenarios, sensors, and physical constraints. In this framework, we also propose a novel reward function that shows significantly improved traffic performance compared to the typical baseline pre-timed and fully-actuated traffic signals controllers. The framework is implemented and validated on a simulation platform emulating real-life traffic scenarios and sensor data streams.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASME ...</summary><p>ASME 2019 Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC), October 9-11, Park City, Utah, USA</p></details> |
| **[An Open-Source Framework for Adaptive Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00395v1)** | 2019-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sub-optimal control policies in transportation systems negatively impact mobility, the environment and human health. Developing optimal transportation control systems at the appropriate scale can be difficult as cities' transportation systems can be large, complex and stochastic. Intersection traffic signal controllers are an important element of modern transportation infrastructure where sub-optimal control policies can incur high costs to many users. Many adaptive traffic signal controllers have been proposed by the community but research is lacking regarding their relative performance difference - which adaptive traffic signal controller is best remains an open question. This research contributes a framework for developing and evaluating different adaptive traffic signal controller models in simulation - both learning and non-learning - and demonstrates its capabilities. The framework is used to first, investigate the performance variance of the modelled adaptive traffic signal controllers with respect to their hyperparameters and second, analyze the performance differences between controllers with optimal hyperparameters. The proposed framework contains implementations of some of the most popular adaptive traffic signal controllers from the literature; Webster's, Max-pressure and Self-Organizing Traffic Lights, along with deep Q-network and deep deterministic policy gradient reinforcement learning controllers. This framework will aid researchers by accelerating their work from a common starting point, allowing them to generate results faster with less effort.

| **[A Genetic Programming System with an Epigenetic Mechanism for Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03854v1)** | 2019-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion is an increasing problem in most cities around the world. It impacts businesses as well as commuters, small cities and large ones in developing as well as developed economies. One approach to decrease urban traffic congestion is to optimize the traffic signal behaviour in order to be adaptive to changes in the traffic conditions. From the perspective of intelligent transportation systems, this optimization problem is called the traffic signal control problem and is considered a large combinatorial problem with high complexity and uncertainty. A novel approach to the traffic signal control problem is proposed in this thesis. The approach includes a new mechanism for Genetic Programming inspired by Epigenetics. Epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in biological processes such as phenotype differentiation, memory consolidation within generations and environmentally induced epigenetic modification of behaviour. These properties lead us to consider the implementation of epigenetic mechanisms as a way to improve the performance of Evolutionary Algorithms in solution to real-world problems with dynamic environmental changes, such as the traffic control signal problem. The epigenetic mechanism proposed was evaluated in four traffic scenarios with different properties and traffic conditions using two microscopic simulators. The results of these experiments indicate that Genetic Programming was able to generate competitive actuated traffic signal controllers for all the scenarios tested. Furthermore, the use of the epigenetic mechanism improved the performance of Genetic Programming in all the scenarios. The evolved controllers adapt to modifications in the traffic density and require less monitoring and less human interaction than other solutions because they dynamically adjust the signal behaviour depending on the local traffic conditions at each intersection.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis, Computer Science Department, Memorial University of Newfoundland.

The rapid increase of vehicle traffic and changes in traffic patterns make traffic signal control more and more challenging. Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based algorithms have demonstrated their potential in dealing with traffic signal control. However, most existing solutions require a large amount of training data, which is unacceptable for many real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel model-based meta-reinforcement learning framework (ModelLight) for traffic signal control. Within ModelLight, an ensemble of models for road intersections and the optimization-based meta-learning method are used to improve the data efficiency of an RL-based traffic light control method. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ModelLight can outperform state-of-the-art traffic light control algorithms while substantially reducing the number of required interactions with the real-world environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Phase Competition for Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04722v1)** | 2019-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasingly available city data and advanced learning techniques have empowered people to improve the efficiency of our city functions. Among them, improving the urban transportation efficiency is one of the most prominent topics. Recent studies have proposed to use reinforcement learning (RL) for traffic signal control. Different from traditional transportation approaches which rely heavily on prior knowledge, RL can learn directly from the feedback. On the other side, without a careful model design, existing RL methods typically take a long time to converge and the learned models may not be able to adapt to new scenarios. For example, a model that is trained well for morning traffic may not work for the afternoon traffic because the traffic flow could be reversed, resulting in a very different state representation. In this paper, we propose a novel design called FRAP, which is based on the intuitive principle of phase competition in traffic signal control: when two traffic signals conflict, priority should be given to one with larger traffic movement (i.e., higher demand). Through the phase competition modeling, our model achieves invariance to symmetrical cases such as flipping and rotation in traffic flow. By conducting comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our model finds better solutions than existing RL methods in the complicated all-phase selection problem, converges much faster during training, and achieves superior generalizability for different road structures and traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Traffic Signal Control via Genetic Programming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17328v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The control of traffic signals is crucial for improving transportation efficiency. Recently, learning-based methods, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), garnered substantial success in the quest for more efficient traffic signal control strategies. However, the design of rewards in DRL highly demands domain knowledge to converge to an effective policy, and the final policy also presents difficulties in terms of explainability. In this work, a new learning-based method for signal control in complex intersections is proposed. In our approach, we design a concept of phase urgency for each signal phase. During signal transitions, the traffic light control strategy selects the next phase to be activated based on the phase urgency. We then proposed to represent the urgency function as an explainable tree structure. The urgency function can calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. Genetic programming is adopted to perform gradient-free optimization of the urgency function. We test our algorithm on multiple public traffic signal control datasets. The experimental results indicate that the tree-shaped urgency function evolved by genetic programming outperforms the baselines, including a state-of-the-art method in the transportation field and a well-known DRL-based method. Our code is available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cooperative Reinforcement Learning on Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11291v2)** | 2022-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control is a challenging real-world problem aiming to minimize overall travel time by coordinating vehicle movements at road intersections. Existing traffic signal control systems in use still rely heavily on oversimplified information and rule-based methods. Specifically, the periodicity of green/red light alternations can be considered as a prior for better planning of each agent in policy optimization. To better learn such adaptive and predictive priors, traditional RL-based methods can only return a fixed length from predefined action pool with only local agents. If there is no cooperation between these agents, some agents often make conflicts to other agents and thus decrease the whole throughput. This paper proposes a cooperative, multi-objective architecture with age-decaying weights to better estimate multiple reward terms for traffic signal control optimization, which termed COoperative Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (COMMA-DDPG). Two types of agents running to maximize rewards of different goals - one for local traffic optimization at each intersection and the other for global traffic waiting time optimization. The global agent is used to guide the local agents as a means for aiding faster learning but not used in the inference phase. We also provide an analysis of solution existence together with convergence proof for the proposed RL optimization. Evaluation is performed using real-world traffic data collected using traffic cameras from an Asian country. Our method can effectively reduce the total delayed time by 60\%. Results demonstrate its superiority when compared to SoTA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Fair Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.10146v1)** | 2021-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control is one of the most effective methods of traffic management in urban areas. In recent years, traffic control methods based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have gained attention due to their ability to exploit real-time traffic data, which is often poorly used by the traditional hand-crafted methods. While most recent DRL-based methods have focused on maximizing the throughput or minimizing the average travel time of the vehicles, the fairness of the traffic signal controllers has often been neglected. This is particularly important as neglecting fairness can lead to situations where some vehicles experience extreme waiting times, or where the throughput of a particular traffic flow is highly impacted by the fluctuations of another conflicting flow at the intersection. In order to address these issues, we introduce two notions of fairness: delay-based and throughput-based fairness, which correspond to the two issues mentioned above. Furthermore, we propose two DRL-based traffic signal control methods for implementing these fairness notions, that can achieve a high throughput as well. We evaluate the performance of our proposed methods using three traffic arrival distributions, and find that our methods outperform the baselines in the tested scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, Accepted at ITSC 2021 (International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems)</p></details> |

Technological advances have made it possible for transportation systems to collect large volumes of varied data on an unprecedented scale. We propose a traffic signal control system which takes advantage of this new, high quality data, with minimal abstraction compared to other proposed systems. We apply modern deep reinforcement learning methods to build a truly adaptive traffic signal control agent in the traffic microsimulator SUMO. We propose a new state space, the discrete traffic state encoding, which is information dense. The discrete traffic state encoding is used as input to a deep convolutional neural network, trained using Q-learning with experience replay. Our agent was compared against a one hidden layer neural network traffic signal control agent and reduces average cumulative delay by 82%, average queue length by 66% and average travel time by 20%.</p></details> |  |

| **[TuSeRACT: Turn-Sample-Based Real-Time Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05591v4)** | 2019-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time traffic signal control is a challenging problem owing to constantly changing traffic demand patterns, limited planning time and various sources of uncertainty (e.g., turn movements, vehicle detection) in the real world. SURTRAC (Scalable URban TRAffic Control) is a recently developed traffic signal control approach which computes delay-minimizing and coordinated (across neighbouring traffic lights) schedules of oncoming vehicle clusters in real time. To ensure real-time responsiveness in the presence of turn-induced uncertainty, SURTRAC computes schedules which minimize the delay for the expected turn movements as opposed to minimizing the expected delay under turn-induced uncertainty. This approximation ensures real-time tractability, but degrades solution quality in the presence of turn-induced uncertainty. To address this limitation, we introduce TuSeRACT (Turn Sample based Real-time trAffic signal ConTrol), a distributed sample-based scheduling approach to traffic signal control. Unlike SURTRAC, TuSeRACT computes schedules that minimize expected delay over sampled turn movements of observed traffic, and communicates samples of traffic outflows to neighbouring intersections. We formulate this sample-based scheduling problem as a constraint program and empirically evaluate our approach on synthetic traffic networks. Our approach provides substantially lower mean vehicular waiting times relative to SURTRAC.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Multi-Agent Deep RL Approach for Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02684v1)** | 2023-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As travel demand increases and urban traffic condition becomes more complicated, applying multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) to traffic signal control becomes one of the hot topics. The rise of Reinforcement Learning (RL) has opened up opportunities for solving Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) in complex urban traffic networks, and deep neural networks have further enhanced their ability to handle complex data. Traditional research in traffic signal control is based on the centralized Reinforcement Learning technique. However, in a large-scale road network, centralized RL is infeasible because of an exponential growth of joint state-action space. In this paper, we propose a Friend-Deep Q-network (Friend-DQN) approach for multiple traffic signal control in urban networks, which is based on an agent-cooperation scheme. In particular, the cooperation between multiple agents can reduce the state-action space and thus speed up the convergence. We use SUMO (Simulation of Urban Transport) platform to evaluate the performance of Friend-DQN model, and show its feasibility and superiority over other existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by PerCOM2023 Workshops</p></details> |

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) systems, allowing controllers to learn optimal policies through interaction with the environment. However, challenges arise due to partial observability (PO) in traffic networks, where agents have limited visibility, hindering effectiveness. This paper presents the integration of Transformer-based controllers into ATSC systems to address PO effectively. We propose strategies to enhance training efficiency and effectiveness, demonstrating improved coordination capabilities in real-world scenarios. The results showcase the Transformer-based model's ability to capture significant information from historical observations, leading to better control policies and improved traffic flow.

| **[A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Traffic Signal Control Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06115v1)** | 2021-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inefficient traffic signal control methods may cause numerous problems, such as traffic congestion and waste of energy. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a trending data-driven approach for adaptive traffic signal control in complex urban traffic networks. Although the development of deep neural networks (DNN) further enhances its learning capability, there are still some challenges in applying deep RLs to transportation networks with multiple signalized intersections, including non-stationarity environment, exploration-exploitation dilemma, multi-agent training schemes, continuous action spaces, etc. In order to address these issues, this paper first proposes a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) method by extending the actor-critic policy gradient algorithms. MADDPG has a centralized learning and decentralized execution paradigm in which critics use additional information to streamline the training process, while actors act on their own local observations. The model is evaluated via simulation on the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) platform. Model comparison results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in controlling traffic lights.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Traffic Signal Control: Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm with Experience Replay and Target Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02755v1)** | 2017-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive traffic signal control, which adjusts traffic signal timing according to real-time traffic, has been shown to be an effective method to reduce traffic congestion. Available works on adaptive traffic signal control make responsive traffic signal control decisions based on human-crafted features (e.g. vehicle queue length). However, human-crafted features are abstractions of raw traffic data (e.g., position and speed of vehicles), which ignore some useful traffic information and lead to suboptimal traffic signal controls. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that automatically extracts all useful features (machine-crafted features) from raw real-time traffic data and learns the optimal policy for adaptive traffic signal control. To improve algorithm stability, we adopt experience replay and target network mechanisms. Simulation results show that our algorithm reduces vehicle delay by up to 47% and 86% when compared to another two popular traffic signal control algorithms, longest queue first algorithm and fixed time control algorithm, respectively.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Real-Time Traffic Signal Control for Modern Roundabouts by Using Particle Swarm Optimization-Based Fuzzy Controller](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.0689v2)** | 2014-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to that the existing traffic facilities can hardly be extended, developing traffic signal control methods is the most important way to improve the traffic efficiency of modern roundabouts. This paper proposes a novel traffic signal controller with two fuzzy layers for signalizing the roundabout. The outer layer of the controller computes urgency degrees of all the phase subsets and then activates the most urgent subset. This mechanism helps to instantly respond to the current traffic condition of the roundabout so as to improve real-timeness. The inner layer of the controller computes extension time of the current phase. If the extension value is larger than a threshold value, the current phase is maintained; otherwise the next phase in the running phase subset (selected by the outer layer) is activated. The inner layer adopts well-designed phase sequences, which helps to smooth the traffic flows and to avoid traffic jam. In general, the proposed traffic signal controller is capable of improving real-timeness as well as reducing traffic congestion. Moreover, an offline particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed to optimize the membership functions adopted in the proposed controller. By using optimal membership functions, the performance of the controller can be further improved. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller outperforms previous traffic signal controllers in terms of improving the traffic efficiency of modern roundabouts.</p></details> |  |

Compared with traditional reinforcement learning and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three main advantages: zero-shot generalization, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by leveraging internal traffic-control policies and reasoning; a compact 3B-parameter design that supports real-time inference on mobile-class chips for edge deployment; and an explainable TSC process that enables multi-intersection coordination through communication and an asynchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks show Traffic-R1 outperforms strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In production, the model now manages signals affecting over 55,000 drivers daily, reduces average queue lengths by more than 5%, and halves operator workload.

| **[Bayesian Meta-reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00163v2)** | 2021-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been increasing amount of interest around meta reinforcement learning methods for traffic signal control, which have achieved better performance compared with traditional control methods. However, previous methods lack robustness in adaptation and stability in training process in complex situations, which largely limits its application in real-world traffic signal control. In this paper, we propose a novel value-based Bayesian meta-reinforcement learning framework BM-DQN to robustly speed up the learning process in new scenarios by utilizing well-trained prior knowledge learned from existing scenarios. This framework is based on our proposed fast-adaptation variation to Gradient-EM Bayesian Meta-learning and the fast-update advantage of DQN, which allows for fast adaptation to new scenarios with continual learning ability and robustness to uncertainty. The experiments on restricted 2D navigation and traffic signal control show that our proposed framework adapts more quickly and robustly in new scenarios than previous methods, and specifically, much better continual learning ability in heterogeneous scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Approaches for Traffic Signal Control under Missing Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.10722v2)** | 2023-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of reinforcement learning (RL) methods in traffic signal control tasks has achieved better performance than conventional rule-based approaches. Most RL approaches require the observation of the environment for the agent to decide which action is optimal for a long-term reward. However, in real-world urban scenarios, missing observation of traffic states may frequently occur due to the lack of sensors, which makes existing RL methods inapplicable on road networks with missing observation. In this work, we aim to control the traffic signals in a real-world setting, where some of the intersections in the road network are not installed with sensors and thus with no direct observations around them. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use RL methods to tackle the traffic signal control problem in this real-world setting. Specifically, we propose two solutions: the first one imputes the traffic states to enable adaptive control, and the second one imputes both states and rewards to enable adaptive control and the training of RL agents. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world road network traffic, we reveal that our method outperforms conventional approaches and performs consistently with different missing rates. We also provide further investigations on how missing data influences the performance of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>With ...</summary><p>With appendix, Published as a conference paper at IJCAI2023</p></details> |

However, most of the current traffic state representations are heuristically designed, with insufficient theoretical support. In this paper, we (1) develop a flexible, efficient, and theoretically grounded method, namely generalized phase pressure (G2P) control, which takes only simple lane features into consideration to decide which phase to be actuated; 2) extend the pressure control theory to a general form for multi-homogeneous-lane road networks based on queueing theory; (3) design a new traffic state representation based on the generalized phase state features from G2P control; and 4) develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm template named G2P-XLight, and two RL algorithms, G2P-MPLight and G2P-CoLight, by combining the generalized phase state representation with MPLight and CoLight, two well-performed RL methods for learning traffic signal control policies. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that G2P control outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) heuristic method in the transportation field and other recent human-designed heuristic methods; and that the newly proposed G2P-XLight significantly outperforms SOTA learning-based approaches.

Conventional transportation approaches implement cooperation by pre-calculating the offsets between two intersections. Such pre-calculated offsets are not suitable for dynamic traffic environments. To enable cooperation of traffic signals, in this paper, we propose a model, CoLight, which uses graph attentional networks to facilitate communication. Specifically, for a target intersection in a network, CoLight can not only incorporate the temporal and spatial influences of neighboring intersections to the target intersection, but also build up index-free modeling of neighboring intersections. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use graph attentional networks in the setting of reinforcement learning for traffic signal control and to conduct experiments on the large-scale road network with hundreds of traffic signals. In experiments, we demonstrate that by learning the communication, the proposed model can achieve superior performance against the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

| **[Quantifying the Impact of Non-Stationarity in Reinforcement Learning-Based Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04778v1)** | 2021-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reinforcement learning (RL), dealing with non-stationarity is a challenging issue. However, some domains such as traffic optimization are inherently non-stationary. Causes for and effects of this are manifold. In particular, when dealing with traffic signal controls, addressing non-stationarity is key since traffic conditions change over time and as a function of traffic control decisions taken in other parts of a network. In this paper we analyze the effects that different sources of non-stationarity have in a network of traffic signals, in which each signal is modeled as a learning agent. More precisely, we study both the effects of changing the \textit{context} in which an agent learns (e.g., a change in flow rates experienced by it), as well as the effects of reducing agent observability of the true environment state. Partial observability may cause distinct states (in which distinct actions are optimal) to be seen as the same by the traffic signal agents. This, in turn, may lead to sub-optimal performance. We show that the lack of suitable sensors to provide a representative observation of the real state seems to affect the performance more drastically than the changes to the underlying traffic patterns.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Q-Learning for Intelligent Traffic Signal Control with Partial Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14337v1)** | 2021-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent traffic signal controllers, applying DQN algorithms to traffic light policy optimization, efficiently reduce traffic congestion by adjusting traffic signals to real-time traffic. Most propositions in the literature however consider that all vehicles at the intersection are detected, an unrealistic scenario. Recently, new wireless communication technologies have enabled cost-efficient detection of connected vehicles by infrastructures. With only a small fraction of the total fleet currently equipped, methods able to perform under low detection rates are desirable. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement Q-learning model to optimize traffic signal control at an isolated intersection, in a partially observable environment with connected vehicles. First, we present the novel DQN model within the RL framework. We introduce a new state representation for partially observable environments and a new reward function for traffic signal control, and provide a network architecture and tuned hyper-parameters. Second, we evaluate the performances of the model in numerical simulations on multiple scenarios, in two steps. At first in full detection against existing actuated controllers, then in partial detection with loss estimates for proportions of connected vehicles. Finally, from the obtained results, we define thresholds for detection rates with acceptable and optimal performance levels.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Multi-hop Upstream Anticipatory Traffic Signal Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07271v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordination in traffic signal control is crucial for managing congestion in urban networks. Existing pressure-based control methods focus only on immediate upstream links, leading to suboptimal green time allocation and increased network delays. However, effective signal control inherently requires coordination across a broader spatial scope, as the effect of upstream traffic should influence signal control decisions at downstream intersections, impacting a large area in the traffic network. Although agent communication using neural network-based feature extraction can implicitly enhance spatial awareness, it significantly increases the learning complexity, adding an additional layer of difficulty to the challenging task of control in deep reinforcement learning. To address the issue of learning complexity and myopic traffic pressure definition, our work introduces a novel concept based on Markov chain theory, namely \textit{multi-hop upstream pressure}, which generalizes the conventional pressure to account for traffic conditions beyond the immediate upstream links. This farsighted and compact metric informs the deep reinforcement learning agent to preemptively clear the multi-hop upstream queues, guiding the agent to optimize signal timings with a broader spatial awareness. Simulations on synthetic and realistic (Toronto) scenarios demonstrate controllers utilizing multi-hop upstream pressure significantly reduce overall network delay by prioritizing traffic movements based on a broader understanding of upstream congestion.</p></details> | 5 tables, 11 figures |

In this study, we explore the computer vision approach for TSC that modulates on-road traffic flows through visual observation. Unlike traditional feature-based approaches, vision-based methods depend much less on heuristics and predefined features, bringing promising potentials for end-to-end learning and optimization of traffic signals. Thus, we introduce a holistic traffic simulation framework called TrafficDojo towards vision-based TSC and its benchmarking by integrating the microscopic traffic flow provided in SUMO into the driving simulator MetaDrive. This proposed framework offers a versatile traffic environment for in-depth analysis and comprehensive evaluation of traffic signal controllers across diverse traffic conditions and scenarios. We establish and compare baseline algorithms including both traditional and Reinforecment Learning (RL) approaches. This work sheds insights into the design and development of vision-based TSC approaches and open up new research opportunities.

| **[Coping with Large Traffic Volumes in Schedule-Driven Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04278v1)** | 2019-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in decentralized, schedule-driven traffic control has demonstrated the ability to significantly improve traffic flow efficiency in complex urban road networks. However, in situations where vehicle volumes increase to the point that the physical capacity of a road network reaches or exceeds saturation, it has been observed that the effectiveness of a schedule-driven approach begins to degrade, leading to progressively higher network congestion. In essence, the traffic control problem becomes less of a scheduling problem and more of a queue management problem in this circumstance. In this paper we propose a composite approach to real-time traffic control that uses sensed information on queue lengths to influence scheduling decisions and gracefully shift the signal control strategy to queue management in high volume/high congestion settings. Specifically, queue-length information is used to establish weights for the sensed vehicle clusters that must be scheduled through a given intersection at any point, and hence bias the wait time minimization calculation. To compute these weights, we develop a model in which successive movement phases are viewed as different states of an Ising model, and parameters quantify strength of interactions. To ensure scalability, queue information is only exchanged between direct neighbors and the asynchronous nature of local intersection scheduling is preserved. We demonstrate the potential of the approach through microscopic traffic simulation of a real-world road network, showing a 60% reduction in average wait times over the baseline schedule-driven approach in heavy traffic scenarios. We also report initial field test results, which show the ability to reduce queues during heavy traffic periods.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICAPS...</summary><p>ICAPS 2017.

Reinforcement learning (RL) for traffic signal control is a promising approach to design better control policies and has attracted considerable research interest in recent years. However, most work done in this area used simplified simulation environments of traffic scenarios to train RL-based TSC. To deploy RL in real-world traffic systems, the gap between simplified simulation environments and real-world applications has to be closed. Therefore, we propose LemgoRL, a benchmark tool to train RL agents as TSC in a realistic simulation environment of Lemgo, a medium-sized town in Germany. In addition to the realistic simulation model, LemgoRL encompasses a traffic signal logic unit that ensures compliance with all regulatory and safety requirements. LemgoRL offers the same interface as the wellknown OpenAI gym toolkit to enable easy deployment in existing research work. To demonstrate the functionality and applicability of LemgoRL, we train a state-of-the-art Deep RL algorithm on a CPU cluster utilizing a framework for distributed and parallel RL and compare its performance with other methods. Our benchmark tool drives the development of RL algorithms towards real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper was accepted by ICMLA 2021 (20th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications).

| **[Improving the generalizability and robustness of large-scale traffic signal control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01925v2)** | 2023-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A number of deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approaches propose to control traffic signals. In this work, we study the robustness of such methods along two axes. First, sensor failures and GPS occlusions create missing-data challenges and we show that recent methods remain brittle in the face of these missing data. Second, we provide a more systematic study of the generalization ability of RL methods to new networks with different traffic regimes. Again, we identify the limitations of recent approaches. We then propose using a combination of distributional and vanilla reinforcement learning through a policy ensemble. Building upon the state-of-the-art previous model which uses a decentralized approach for large-scale traffic signal control with graph convolutional networks (GCNs), we first learn models using a distributional reinforcement learning (DisRL) approach. In particular, we use implicit quantile networks (IQN) to model the state-action return distribution with quantile regression. For traffic signal control problems, an ensemble of standard RL and DisRL yields superior performance across different scenarios, including different levels of missing sensor data and traffic flow patterns. Furthermore, the learning scheme of the resulting model can improve zero-shot transferability to different road network structures, including both synthetic networks and real-world networks (e.g., Luxembourg, Manhattan). We conduct extensive experiments to compare our approach to multi-agent reinforcement learning and traditional transportation approaches. Results show that the proposed method improves robustness and generalizability in the face of missing data, varying road networks, and traffic flows.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, several approaches based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) have been studied experimentally. These approaches propose distributed techniques in which each signalized intersection is seen as an agent in a stochastic game whose purpose is to optimize the flow of vehicles in its vicinity. In this setting, the systems evolves towards an equilibrium among the agents that shows beneficial for the whole traffic network. A recently developed multi-agent variant of the well-established advantage actor-critic (A2C) algorithm, called MA2C (multi-agent A2C) exploits the promising idea of some communication among the agents. In this view,the agents share their strategies with other neighbor agents, thereby stabilizing the learning process even when the agents grow in number and variety. We experimented MA2C in two traffic networks located in Bologna (Italy) and found that its action translates into a significant decrease of the amount of pollutants released into the environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 21 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2107.01347</p></details> |
| **[Joint Optimization of Traffic Signal Control and Vehicle Routing in Signalized Road Networks using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10856v1)** | 2023-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban traffic congestion is a critical predicament that plagues modern road networks. To alleviate this issue and enhance traffic efficiency, traffic signal control and vehicle routing have proven to be effective measures. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization approach for traffic signal control and vehicle routing in signalized road networks. The objective is to enhance network performance by simultaneously controlling signal timings and route choices using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Signal control agents (SAs) are employed to establish signal timings at intersections, whereas vehicle routing agents (RAs) are responsible for selecting vehicle routes. By establishing relevance between agents and enabling them to share observations and rewards, interaction and cooperation among agents are fostered, which enhances individual training. The Multi-Agent Advantage Actor-Critic algorithm is used to handle multi-agent environments, and Deep Neural Network (DNN) structures are designed to facilitate the algorithm's convergence. Notably, our work is the first to utilize MADRL in determining the optimal joint policy for signal control and vehicle routing. Numerical experiments conducted on the modified Sioux network demonstrate that our integration of signal control and vehicle routing outperforms controlling signal timings or vehicles' routes alone in enhancing traffic efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chat2SPaT: A Large Language Model Based Tool for Automating Traffic Signal Control Plan Management](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05283v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT) results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS) software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan. Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300 plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers, serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/yuewangits/Chat2SPaT.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Constrained Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach to Autonomous Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23626v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion in modern cities is exacerbated by the limitations of traditional fixed-time traffic signal systems, which fail to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns. Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) algorithms have emerged as a solution by dynamically adjusting signal timing based on real-time traffic conditions. However, the main limitation of such methods is that they are not transferable to environments under real-world constraints, such as balancing efficiency, minimizing collisions, and ensuring fairness across intersections. In this paper, we view the ATSC problem as a constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose a novel algorithm named Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with Lagrange Cost Estimator (MAPPO-LCE) to produce effective traffic signal control policies. Our approach integrates the Lagrange multipliers method to balance rewards and constraints, with a cost estimator for stable adjustment. We also introduce three constraints on the traffic network: GreenTime, GreenSkip, and PhaseSkip, which penalize traffic policies that do not conform to real-world scenarios. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MAPPO-LCE outperforms three baseline MARL algorithms by across all environments and traffic constraints (improving on MAPPO by 12.60%, IPPO by 10.29%, and QTRAN by 13.10%). Our results show that constrained MARL is a valuable tool for traffic planners to deploy scalable and efficient ATSC methods in real-world traffic networks.

In particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency function representation can significantly improve the performance of the learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal control policies.</p></details> |  |

Roughly one-quarter of road accidents in the U.S. happen at intersections due to problematic signal timing, urging the development of safety-oriented intersection control. However, existing studies on adaptive traffic signal control using reinforcement learning technologies have focused mainly on minimizing traffic delay but neglecting the potential exposure to unsafe conditions. We, for the first time, incorporate road safety standards as enforcement to ensure the safety of existing reinforcement learning methods, aiming toward operating intersections with zero collisions. We have proposed a safety-enhanced residual reinforcement learning method (SafeLight) and employed multiple optimization techniques, such as multi-objective loss function and reward shaping for better knowledge integration. Extensive experiments are conducted using both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. Results show that our method can significantly reduce collisions while increasing traffic mobility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2023, appendix included. 9 pages + 5 pages appendix, 12 figures, in Proceedings of the Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI'23), Feb 2023</p></details> |

Considering 1) the massive amount of experience required to train such methods, and 2) that experience must be gathered by interacting in an exploratory fashion with real road-network-users, such a lack of transferability limits experimentation and applicability. Recent approaches enable learning policies that generalize for unseen road-network topologies and traffic distributions, partially tackling this challenge. However, the literature remains divided between the learning of cyclic (the evolution of connectivity at an intersection must respect a cycle) and acyclic (less constrained) policies, and these transferable methods 1) are only compatible with cyclic constraints and 2) do not enable coordination. We introduce a new model-based method, MuJAM, which, on top of enabling explicit coordination at scale for the first time, pushes generalization further by allowing a generalization to the controllers' constraints. In a zero-shot transfer setting involving both road networks and traffic settings never experienced during training, and in a larger transfer experiment involving the control of 3,971 traffic signal controllers in Manhattan, we show that MuJAM, using both cyclic and acyclic constraints, outperforms domain-specific baselines as well as another transferable approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |

However, achieving effective and scalable cooperation among junctions (agents) remains an open challenge, as existing methods often rely on extensive, non-generalizable reward shaping or on non-scalable centralized learning. To address these problems, we propose a new MARL method for traffic signal control, SocialLight, which learns cooperative traffic control policies by distributedly estimating the individual marginal contribution of agents on their local neighborhood. SocialLight relies on the Asynchronous Actor Critic (A3C) framework, and makes learning scalable by learning a locally-centralized critic conditioned over the states and actions of neighboring agents, used by agents to estimate individual contributions by counterfactual reasoning. We further introduce important modifications to the advantage calculation that help stabilize policy updates. These modifications decouple the impact of the neighbors' actions on the computed advantages, thereby reducing the variance in the gradient updates. We benchmark our trained network against state-of-the-art traffic signal control methods on standard benchmarks in two traffic simulators, SUMO and CityFlow. Our results show that SocialLight exhibits improved scalability to larger road networks and better performance across usual traffic metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2023)</p></details> |

Traditional TSC methods, primarily based on transportation engineering and reinforcement learning (RL), often struggle with generalization abilities across varied traffic scenarios and lack interpretability. This paper presents LLMLight, a novel framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) as decision-making agents for TSC. Specifically, the framework begins by instructing the LLM with a knowledgeable prompt detailing real-time traffic conditions. Leveraging the advanced generalization capabilities of LLMs, LLMLight engages a reasoning and decision-making process akin to human intuition for effective traffic control. Moreover, we build LightGPT, a specialized backbone LLM tailored for TSC tasks. By learning nuanced traffic patterns and control strategies, LightGPT enhances the LLMLight framework cost-effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-world and synthetic datasets, along with evaluations by fifteen human experts, demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness, generalization ability, and interpretability of LLMLight with LightGPT, outperforming nine baseline methods and ten advanced LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Multi-agent reinforcement learning attempts to address this challenge by distributing control to specialized agents. However, specialization hinders generalization and transferability, and the computational graphs underlying neural-networks architectures -- dominating in the multi-agent setting -- do not offer the flexibility to handle an arbitrary number of entities which changes both between road networks, and over time as vehicles traverse the network. We introduce Inductive Graph Reinforcement Learning (IG-RL) based on graph-convolutional networks which adapts to the structure of any road network, to learn detailed representations of traffic-controllers and their surroundings. Our decentralized approach enables learning of a transferable-adaptive-traffic-signal-control policy. After being trained on an arbitrary set of road networks, our model can generalize to new road networks, traffic distributions, and traffic regimes, with no additional training and a constant number of parameters, enabling greater scalability compared to prior methods. Furthermore, our approach can exploit the granularity of available data by capturing the (dynamic) demand at both the lane and the vehicle levels. The proposed method is tested on both road networks and traffic settings never experienced during training. We compare IG-RL to multi-agent reinforcement learning and domain-specific baselines. In both synthetic road networks and in a larger experiment involving the control of the 3,971 traffic signals of Manhattan, we show that different instantiations of IG-RL outperform baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, 1 table.

| **[Privacy-Preserving Adaptive Traffic Signal Control in a Connected Vehicle Environment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07212v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Connected Vehicles (CVs) have demonstrated tremendous potential to enhance traffic operations, they can impose privacy risks on individual travelers, e.g., leaking sensitive information about their frequently visited places, routing behavior, etc. Despite the large body of literature that devises various algorithms to exploit CV information, research on privacy-preserving traffic control is still in its infancy. In this paper, we aim to fill this research gap and propose a privacy-preserving adaptive traffic signal control method using CV data. Specifically, we leverage secure Multi-Party Computation and differential privacy to devise a privacy-preserving CV data aggregation mechanism, which can calculate key traffic quantities without any CVs having to reveal their private data. We further develop a linear optimization model for adaptive signal control based on the traffic variables obtained via the data aggregation mechanism. The proposed linear programming problem is further extended to a stochastic programming problem to explicitly handle the noises added by the differentially private mechanism. Evaluation results show that the linear optimization model preserves privacy with a marginal impact on control performance, and the stochastic programming model can significantly reduce residual queues compared to the linear programming model, with almost no increase in vehicle delay. Overall, our methods demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating privacy-preserving mechanisms in CV-based traffic modeling and control, which guarantees both utility and privacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaVIM: Meta Variationally Intrinsic Motivated Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00746v5)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control aims to coordinate traffic signals across intersections to improve the traffic efficiency of a district or a city. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to traffic signal control recently and demonstrated promising performance where each traffic signal is regarded as an agent. However, there are still several challenges that may limit its large-scale application in the real world. To make the policy learned from a training scenario generalizable to new unseen scenarios, a novel Meta Variationally Intrinsic Motivated (MetaVIM) RL method is proposed to learn the decentralized policy for each intersection that considers neighbor information in a latent way. Specifically, we formulate the policy learning as a meta-learning problem over a set of related tasks, where each task corresponds to traffic signal control at an intersection whose neighbors are regarded as the unobserved part of the state. Then, a learned latent variable is introduced to represent the task's specific information and is further brought into the policy for learning. In addition, to make the policy learning stable, a novel intrinsic reward is designed to encourage each agent's received rewards and observation transition to be predictable only conditioned on its own history. Extensive experiments conducted on CityFlow demonstrate that the proposed method substantially outperforms existing approaches and shows superior generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-scale Regional Traffic Signal Control Based on Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09252v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of global urbanization and motorization, traffic congestion has become a significant issue, severely affecting the quality of life, environment, and economy. This paper puts forward a single-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based regional traffic signal control (TSC) model. Different from multi - agent systems, this model can coordinate traffic signals across a large area, with the goals of alleviating regional traffic congestion and minimizing the total travel time. The TSC environment is precisely defined through specific state space, action space, and reward functions. The state space consists of the current congestion state, which is represented by the queue lengths of each link, and the current signal phase scheme of intersections. The action space is designed to select an intersection first and then adjust its phase split. Two reward functions are meticulously crafted. One focuses on alleviating congestion and the other aims to minimize the total travel time while considering the congestion level. The experiments are carried out with the SUMO traffic simulation software. The performance of the TSC model is evaluated by comparing it with a base case where no signal-timing adjustments are made. The results show that the model can effectively control congestion. For example, the queuing length is significantly reduced in the scenarios tested. Moreover, when the reward is set to both alleviate congestion and minimize the total travel time, the average travel time is remarkably decreased, which indicates that the model can effectively improve traffic conditions. This research provides a new approach for large-scale regional traffic signal control and offers valuable insights for future urban traffic management.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2503.02279</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a cooperative multi-objective architecture called Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MOMA-DDPG), which estimates multiple reward terms for traffic signal control optimization using age-decaying weights. Our approach involves two types of agents: one focuses on optimizing local traffic at each intersection, while the other aims to optimize global traffic throughput. We evaluate our method using real-world traffic data collected from an Asian country's traffic cameras. Despite the inclusion of a global agent, our solution remains decentralized as this agent is no longer necessary during the inference stage. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of MOMA-DDPG, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across all performance metrics. Additionally, our proposed system minimizes both waiting time and carbon emissions. Notably, this paper is the first to link carbon emissions and global agents in traffic signal control.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2205.11291</p></details> |

To address this issue, various tools can exert influence on traffic safety both directly and indirectly. This study focuses on investigating the impact of adaptive signal control and connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) on intersection safety using a deep reinforcement learning approach. The objective is to assess the individual and combined effects of CAVs and adaptive traffic signal control on traffic safety, considering rear-end and crossing conflicts. The study employs a Deep Q Network (DQN) to regulate traffic signals and driving behaviors of both CAVs and Human Drive Vehicles (HDVs), and uses Time To Collision (TTC) metric to evaluate safety. The findings demonstrate a significant reduction in rear-end and crossing conflicts through the combined implementation of CAVs and DQNs-based traffic signal control. Additionally, the long-term positive effects of CAVs on safety are similar to the short-term effects of combined CAVs and DQNs-based traffic signal control. Overall, the study emphasizes the potential benefits of integrating CAVs and adaptive traffic signal control approaches in order to enhance traffic safety. The findings of this study could provide valuable insights for city officials and transportation authorities in developing effective strategies to improve safety at signalized intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>TRB 1...</summary><p>TRB 103nd Annual Meeting</p></details> |

However, in current decades, it continues to pose significant challenges in managing large-scale traffic networks, coordinating intersections, and ensuring robustness under uncertain traffic conditions. This paper presents a scalable multi-objective optimization approach for robust traffic signal control in dynamic and uncertain urban environments. A multi-objective optimization model is proposed in this paper, which incorporates stochastic variables and probabilistic traffic patterns to capture traffic flow dynamics and uncertainty. We propose an algorithm named Adaptive Hybrid Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithm (AHMOA), which addresses the uncertainties of city traffic, including network-wide signal coordination, fluctuating patterns, and environmental impacts. AHMOA simultaneously optimizes multiple objectives, such as average delay, network stability, and system robustness, while adapting to unpredictable changes in traffic. The algorithm combines evolutionary strategies with an adaptive mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation, and incorporates a memory-based evaluation mechanism to leverage historical traffic data. Simulations are conducted in different cities including Manhattan, Paris, Sao Paulo, and Istanbul. The experimental results demonstrate that AHMOA consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms and the algorithm is competent to provide scalable, robust Pareto optimal solutions for managing complex traffic systems under uncertain environments.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Injection of malicious data can result in significantly decreased performance of such applications, increased vehicle delays, fuel consumption, congestion, or even safety threats. This paper introduces a method, which combines a model of expected driver behaviour with position verification in order to detect the malicious data injected by vehicle nodes that perform Sybil attacks. Effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated in simulation experiments for a decentralized self-organizing system that controls the traffic signals at multiple intersections in an urban road network. Experimental results show that the proposed method is useful for mitigating the negative impact of malicious data on the performance of traffic signal control.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Learning an Interpretable Traffic Signal Control Policy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.11023v2)** | 2020-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signalized intersections are managed by controllers that assign right of way (green, yellow, and red lights) to non-conflicting directions. Optimizing the actuation policy of such controllers is expected to alleviate traffic congestion and its adverse impact. Given such a safety-critical domain, the affiliated actuation policy is required to be interpretable in a way that can be understood and regulated by a human. This paper presents and analyzes several on-line optimization techniques for tuning interpretable control functions. Although these techniques are defined in a general way, this paper assumes a specific class of interpretable control functions (polynomial functions) for analysis purposes. We show that such an interpretable policy function can be as effective as a deep neural network for approximating an optimized signal actuation policy. We present empirical evidence that supports the use of value-based reinforcement learning for on-line training of the control function. Specifically, we present and study three variants of the Deep Q-learning algorithm that allow the training of an interpretable policy function. Our Deep Regulatable Hardmax Q-learning variant is shown to be particularly effective in optimizing our interpretable actuation policy, resulting in up to 19.4% reduced vehicles delay compared to commonly deployed actuated signal controllers.</p></details> |  |

However, its design depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator) and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers. This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation engineering.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, the availability of vehicle-to-anything communication allows for the transmission of detailed vehicle states to the infrastructure that can be used for intelligent traffic light control. The other way around, the infrastructure can provide vehicles with advice on driving behavior, such as appropriate velocities, which can improve the efficacy of the traffic system. Several research works applied deep reinforcement learning to either traffic light control or vehicle speed advice. In this work, we propose a first attempt to jointly learn the control of both. We show this to improve the efficacy of traffic systems. In our experiments, the joint control approach reduces average vehicle trip delays, w.r.t. controlling only traffic lights, in eight out of eleven benchmark scenarios. Analyzing the qualitative behavior of the vehicle speed advice policy, we observe that this is achieved by smoothing out the velocity profile of vehicles nearby a traffic light. Learning joint control of traffic signaling and speed advice in the real world could help to reduce congestion and mitigate the economical and environmental repercussions of today's traffic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication at IEEE ICMLA 2023</p></details> |

Specifically, real-time vehicle trajectory data, future traffic demand prediction and parallel simulation strategy are considered to develop two DT-based ATSC algorithms, namely DT1 (Digital Twin 1) and DT2 (Digital Twin 2). DT1 uses the delay experienced by each vehicle from all approaches connected to the subject intersection, while DT2 uses the delay of each vehicle that occurred in all the approaches connected to the subject intersection as well as immediate adjacent intersection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms, the DT-based ATSC algorithms are evaluated with varying traffic demands at intersection, and individual user level. Evaluation results show that both DT1 and DT2 performs significantly better compared to the density-based baseline algorithm in terms of control delay reductions ranging from 1% to 52% for low traffic demands. DT1 outperforms baseline algorithm for moderate traffic demands, achieving reduction in control delay ranging from 3% to 19%, while the performance of DT2 declines with increasing demand. For high traffic demands, DT1 achieved control delay reduction ranging from 1% to 45% and DT2 achieved 8% to 36% compared to the baseline algorithm. Moreover, DT1 and DT2 effectively distribute the delay per vehicle among all the vehicles, which approach towards intersection, compared to the baseline ATSC algorithm. This helps to improve user satisfaction by reducing prolonged delays at a traffic signal, specifically, for moderate and high traffic demands.</p></details> |  |

But optimizing the control plans when severe incidents occur still remains a hard topic to address, especially if a high number of lanes or entire intersections are affected. This paper aims at tackling this problem and presents a novel methodology for optimizing the traffic signal timings in signalized urban intersections, under non-recurrent traffic incidents. The approach relies on deploying genetic algorithms (GA) by considering the phase durations as decision variables and the objective function to minimize as the total travel time in the network. Firstly, we develop the GA algorithm on a signalized testbed network under recurrent traffic conditions, with the purpose of fine-tuning the algorithm for crossover, mutation, fitness calculation, and obtain the optimal phase durations. Secondly, we apply the optimal signal timings previously found under severe incidents affecting the traffic flow in the network but without any further optimization. Lastly, we further apply the GA optimization under incident conditions and show that our approach improved the total travel time by almost 40.76%.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 15 figures, preprint for the 26th ITS World Congress 21-25 Oct 2019, Singapore</p></details> |

In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have emerged as a popular approach for TSC and show promising results for highly adaptive control. However, existing RL-based methods suffer from notably poor real-world applicability and hardly have any successful deployments. The reasons for such failures are mostly due to the reliance on over-idealized traffic simulators for policy optimization, as well as using unrealistic fine-grained state observations and reward signals that are not directly obtainable from real-world sensors. In this paper, we propose a fully Data-Driven and simulator-free framework for realistic Traffic Signal Control (D2TSC). Specifically, we combine well-established traffic flow theory with machine learning to construct a reward inference model to infer the reward signals from coarse-grained traffic data. With the inferred rewards, we further propose a sample-efficient offline RL method to enable direct signal control policy learning from historical offline datasets of real-world intersections. To evaluate our approach, we collect historical traffic data from a real-world intersection, and develop a highly customized simulation environment that strictly follows real data characteristics. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our approach achieves superior performance over conventional and offline RL baselines, and also enjoys much better real-world applicability.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

As an alternative, optimizing existing traffic management systems, particularly through adaptive traffic signal control, offers a promising solution. This paper explores the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance traffic signal operations at intersections, aiming to reduce congestion without extensive sensor networks. We introduce two RL-based algorithms: a turn-based agent, which dynamically prioritizes traffic signals based on real-time queue lengths, and a time-based agent, which adjusts signal phase durations according to traffic conditions while following a fixed phase cycle. By representing the state as a scalar queue length, our approach simplifies the learning process and lowers deployment costs. The algorithms were tested in four distinct traffic scenarios using seven evaluation metrics to comprehensively assess performance. Simulation results demonstrate that both RL algorithms significantly outperform conventional traffic signal control systems, highlighting their potential to improve urban traffic flow efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The dynamic nature of traffic flow has prompted researchers to explore Reinforcement Learning (RL) for traffic signal control (TSC). Compared with traditional methods, RL-based solutions have shown preferable performance. However, the application of RL-based traffic signal controllers in the real world is limited by the low sample efficiency and high computational requirements of these solutions. In this work, we propose DTLight, a simple yet powerful lightweight Decision Transformer-based TSC method that can learn policy from easily accessible offline datasets. DTLight novelly leverages knowledge distillation to learn a lightweight controller from a well-trained larger teacher model to reduce implementation computation. Additionally, it integrates adapter modules to mitigate the expenses associated with fine-tuning, which makes DTLight practical for online adaptation with minimal computation and only a few fine-tuning steps during real deployment. Moreover, DTLight is further enhanced to be more applicable to real-world TSC problems. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world scenarios show that DTLight pre-trained purely on offline datasets can outperform state-of-the-art online RL-based methods in most scenarios. Experiment results also show that online fine-tuning further improves the performance of DTLight by up to 42.6% over the best online RL baseline methods.

Due to the complexity of long-horizon control and coordination, most prior TSC methods leverage deep reinforcement learning (RL) to search for a control policy and have witnessed great success. However, TSC still faces two significant challenges. 1) The travel time of a vehicle is delayed feedback on the effectiveness of TSC policy at each traffic intersection since it is obtained after the vehicle has left the road network. Although several heuristic reward functions have been proposed as substitutes for travel time, they are usually biased and not leading the policy to improve in the correct direction. 2) The traffic condition of each intersection is influenced by the non-local intersections since vehicles traverse multiple intersections over time. Therefore, the TSC agent is required to leverage both the local observation and the non-local traffic conditions to predict the long-horizontal traffic conditions of each intersection comprehensively. To address these challenges, we propose DenseLight, a novel RL-based TSC method that employs an unbiased reward function to provide dense feedback on policy effectiveness and a non-local enhanced TSC agent to better predict future traffic conditions for more precise traffic control. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that DenseLight can consistently outperform advanced baselines on various road networks with diverse traffic flows.

| **[Federated Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05553v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC), enabling multiple intersections to coordinate signal timings in real time. However, in large-scale settings, MARL faces constraints due to extensive data sharing and communication requirements. Federated learning (FL) mitigates these challenges by training shared models without directly exchanging raw data, yet traditional FL methods such as FedAvg struggle with highly heterogeneous intersections. Different intersections exhibit varying traffic patterns, demands, and road structures, so performing FedAvg across all agents is inefficient. To address this gap, we propose Hierarchical Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL) for ATSC. HFRL employs clustering-based or optimization-based techniques to dynamically group intersections and perform FedAvg independently within groups of intersections with similar characteristics, enabling more effective coordination and scalability than standard FedAvg. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world traffic networks demonstrate that HFRL not only outperforms both decentralized and standard federated RL approaches but also identifies suitable grouping patterns based on network structure or traffic demand, resulting in a more robust framework for distributed, heterogeneous systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Intelligent Traffic Signal Controls with Optimized CO2 emissions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13129v2)** | 2023-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, transportation networks face the challenge of sub-optimal control policies that can have adverse effects on human health, the environment, and contribute to traffic congestion. Increased levels of air pollution and extended commute times caused by traffic bottlenecks make intersection traffic signal controllers a crucial component of modern transportation infrastructure. Despite several adaptive traffic signal controllers in literature, limited research has been conducted on their comparative performance. Furthermore, despite carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions' significance as a global issue, the literature has paid limited attention to this area. In this report, we propose EcoLight, a reward shaping scheme for reinforcement learning algorithms that not only reduces CO2 emissions but also achieves competitive results in metrics such as travel time. We compare the performance of tabular Q-Learning, DQN, SARSA, and A2C algorithms using metrics such as travel time, CO2 emissions, waiting time, and stopped time. Our evaluation considers multiple scenarios that encompass a range of road users (trucks, buses, cars) with varying pollution levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 1 table.

Current SOTA methods model road networks as topological graph structures, incorporate graph attention into deep Q-learning, and merge local and global embeddings to improve policy. However, graph-based methods are difficult to parallelize, resulting in huge time overhead. Moreover, none of the current peer studies have deployed dynamic traffic systems for experiments, which is far from the actual situation. In this context, we propose Multi-Scene Aggregation Convolutional Learning for traffic signal control (MacLight), which offers faster training speeds and more stable performance. Our approach consists of two main components. The first is the global representation, where we utilize variational autoencoders to compactly compress and extract the global representation. The second component employs the proximal policy optimization algorithm as the backbone, allowing value evaluation to consider both local features and global embedding representations. This backbone model significantly reduces time overhead and ensures stability in policy updates. We validated our method across multiple traffic scenarios under both static and dynamic traffic systems. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to general and domian SOTA methods, our approach achieves superior stability, optimized convergence levels and the highest time efficiency.

| **[Multi-agent Reinforcement Traffic Signal Control based on Interpretable Influence Mechanism and Biased ReLU Approximation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13639v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control is important in intelligent transportation system, of which cooperative control is difficult to realize but yet vital. Many methods model multi-intersection traffic networks as grids and address the problem using multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL). Despite these existing studies, there is an opportunity to further enhance our understanding of the connectivity and globality of the traffic networks by capturing the spatiotemporal traffic information with efficient neural networks in deep RL. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent actor-critic framework based on an interpretable influence mechanism with a centralized learning and decentralized execution method. Specifically, we first construct an actor-critic framework, for which the piecewise linear neural network (PWLNN), named biased ReLU (BReLU), is used as the function approximator to obtain a more accurate and theoretically grounded approximation. Finally, our proposed framework is validated on two synthetic traffic networks to coordinate signal control between intersections, achieving lower traffic delays across the entire traffic network compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoTV: Cooperative Control for Traffic Light Signals and Connected Autonomous Vehicles using Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13143v2)** | 2023-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The target of reducing travel time only is insufficient to support the development of future smart transportation systems. To align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDG), a further reduction of fuel and emissions, improvements of traffic safety, and the ease of infrastructure deployment and maintenance should also be considered. Different from existing work focusing on the optimization of the control in either traffic light signal (to improve the intersection throughput), or vehicle speed (to stabilize the traffic), this paper presents a multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) system called CoTV, which Cooperatively controls both Traffic light signals and Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV). Therefore, our CoTV can well balance the achievement of the reduction of travel time, fuel, and emissions. In the meantime, CoTV can also be easy to deploy by cooperating with only one CAV that is the nearest to the traffic light controller on each incoming road. This enables more efficient coordination between traffic light controllers and CAV, thus leading to the convergence of training CoTV under the large-scale multi-agent scenario that is traditionally difficult to converge. We give the detailed system design of CoTV and demonstrate its effectiveness in a simulation study using SUMO under various grid maps and realistic urban scenarios with mixed-autonomy traffic.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often struggle to generalize beyond their training environments to unseen scenarios with varying traffic dynamics. We present TransferLight, a novel framework designed for robust generalization across road-networks, diverse traffic conditions and intersection geometries. At its core, we propose a log-distance reward function, offering spatially-aware signal prioritization while remaining adaptable to varied lane configurations - overcoming the limitations of traditional pressure-based rewards. Our hierarchical, heterogeneous, and directed graph neural network architecture effectively captures granular traffic dynamics, enabling transferability to arbitrary intersection layouts. Using a decentralized multi-agent approach, global rewards, and novel state transition priors, we develop a single, weight-tied policy that scales zero-shot to any road network without re-training. Through domain randomization during training, we additionally enhance generalization capabilities. Experimental results validate TransferLight's superior performance in unseen scenarios, advancing practical, generalizable intelligent transportation systems to meet evolving urban traffic demands.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI Workshop Paper (MALTA)</p></details> |

Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely used for this task in recent years, demonstrating promising performance but also facing many challenges such as limited performances and sample inefficiency. To handle these challenges, MTLight is proposed to enhance the agent observation with a latent state, which is learned from numerous traffic indicators. Meanwhile, multiple auxiliary and supervisory tasks are constructed to learn the latent state, and two types of embedding latent features, the task-specific feature and task-shared feature, are used to make the latent state more abundant. Extensive experiments conducted on CityFlow demonstrate that MTLight has leading convergence speed and asymptotic performance. We further simulate under peak-hour pattern in all scenarios with increasing control difficulty and the results indicate that MTLight is highly adaptable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feudal Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Network Partition for Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13836v1)** | 2022-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been applied and shown great potential in multi-intersections traffic signal control, where multiple agents, one for each intersection, must cooperate together to optimize traffic flow. To encourage global cooperation, previous work partitions the traffic network into several regions and learns policies for agents in a feudal structure. However, static network partition fails to adapt to dynamic traffic flow, which will changes frequently over time. To address this, we propose a novel feudal MARL approach with adaptive network partition. Specifically, we first partition the network into several regions according to the traffic flow. To do this, we propose two approaches: one is directly to use graph neural network (GNN) to generate the network partition, and the other is to use Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) to find the best partition with criteria computed by GNN. Then, we design a variant of Qmix using GNN to handle various dimensions of input, given by the dynamic network partition. Finally, we use a feudal hierarchy to manage agents in each partition and promote global cooperation. By doing so, agents are able to adapt to the traffic flow as required in practice. We empirically evaluate our method both in a synthetic traffic grid and real-world traffic networks of three cities, widely used in the literature. Our experimental results confirm that our method can achieve better performance, in terms of average travel time and queue length, than several leading methods for traffic signal control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communication Strategy on Macro-and-Micro Traffic State in Cooperative Deep Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13248v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) has become a popular research topic in intelligent transportation systems. Regional Traffic Signal Control (RTSC) using the Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) technique has become a promising approach for ATSC due to its ability to achieve the optimum trade-off between scalability and optimality. Most existing RTSC approaches partition a traffic network into several disjoint regions, followed by applying centralized reinforcement learning techniques to each region. However, the pursuit of cooperation among RTSC agents still remains an open issue and no communication strategy for RTSC agents has been investigated. In this paper, we propose communication strategies to capture the correlation of micro-traffic states among lanes and the correlation of macro-traffic states among intersections. We first justify the evolution equation of the RTSC process is Markovian via a system of store-and-forward queues. Next, based on the evolution equation, we propose two GAT-Aggregated (GA2) communication modules--GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug to extract both intra-region and inter-region correlations between macro and micro traffic states. While GA2-Naive only considers the movements at each intersection, GA2-Aug also considers the lane-changing behavior of vehicles. Two proposed communication modules are then aggregated into two existing novel RTSC frameworks--RegionLight and Regional-DRL. Experimental results demonstrate that both GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug effectively improve the performance of existing RTSC frameworks under both real and synthetic scenarios. Hyperparameter testing also reveals the robustness and potential of our communication modules in large-scale traffic networks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Factor Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00554v1)** | 2019-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of the successful deep neural network architectures are structured, often consisting of elements like convolutional neural networks and gated recurrent neural networks. Recently, graph neural networks have been successfully applied to graph structured data such as point cloud and molecular data. These networks often only consider pairwise dependencies, as they operate on a graph structure. We generalize the graph neural network into a factor graph neural network (FGNN) in order to capture higher order dependencies. We show that FGNN is able to represent Max-Product Belief Propagation, an approximate inference algorithm on probabilistic graphical models; hence it is able to do well when Max-Product does well. Promising results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Graph Machines: Learning Neural Networks Using Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04818v1)** | 2017-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Label propagation is a powerful and flexible semi-supervised learning technique on graphs. Neural networks, on the other hand, have proven track records in many supervised learning tasks. In this work, we propose a training framework with a graph-regularised objective, namely "Neural Graph Machines", that can combine the power of neural networks and label propagation. This work generalises previous literature on graph-augmented training of neural networks, enabling it to be applied to multiple neural architectures (Feed-forward NNs, CNNs and LSTM RNNs) and a wide range of graphs. The new objective allows the neural networks to harness both labeled and unlabeled data by: (a) allowing the network to train using labeled data as in the supervised setting, (b) biasing the network to learn similar hidden representations for neighboring nodes on a graph, in the same vein as label propagation. Such architectures with the proposed objective can be trained efficiently using stochastic gradient descent and scaled to large graphs, with a runtime that is linear in the number of edges. The proposed joint training approach convincingly outperforms many existing methods on a wide range of tasks (multi-label classification on social graphs, news categorization, document classification and semantic intent classification), with multiple forms of graph inputs (including graphs with and without node-level features) and using different types of neural networks.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Learning Equivariant Representations of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12143v3)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks that process the parameters of other neural networks find applications in domains as diverse as classifying implicit neural representations, generating neural network weights, and predicting generalization errors. However, existing approaches either overlook the inherent permutation symmetry in the neural network or rely on intricate weight-sharing patterns to achieve equivariance, while ignoring the impact of the network architecture itself. In this work, we propose to represent neural networks as computational graphs of parameters, which allows us to harness powerful graph neural networks and transformers that preserve permutation symmetry. Consequently, our approach enables a single model to encode neural computational graphs with diverse architectures. We showcase the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of tasks, including classification and editing of implicit neural representations, predicting generalization performance, and learning to optimize, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Neural networks, inspired by biological systems, are widely used for tasks such as pattern recognition, data classification, and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a well-established framework, have recently been extended to Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs), with their properties and applications being actively studied. The Plithogenic Graph framework enhances graph representations by integrating multi-valued attributes, as well as membership and contradiction functions, enabling the detailed modeling of complex relationships. In the context of handling uncertainty, concepts such as Fuzzy Graphs and Neutrosophic Graphs have gained prominence. It is well established that Plithogenic Graphs serve as a generalization of both Fuzzy Graphs and Neutrosophic Graphs. Furthermore, the Fuzzy Graph Neural Network has been proposed and is an active area of research. This paper establishes the theoretical foundation for the development of SuperHyperGraph Neural Networks (SHGNNs) and Plithogenic Graph Neural Networks, expanding the applicability of neural networks to these advanced graph structures. While mathematical generalizations and proofs are presented, future computational experiments are anticipated.</p></details> | 77 pages; 3 figures |

However, despite their wide use, there is currently little understanding of the relationship between the graph structure of the neural network and its predictive performance. Here we systematically investigate how does the graph structure of neural networks affect their predictive performance. To this end, we develop a novel graph-based representation of neural networks called relational graph, where layers of neural network computation correspond to rounds of message exchange along the graph structure. Using this representation we show that: (1) a "sweet spot" of relational graphs leads to neural networks with significantly improved predictive performance; (2) neural network's performance is approximately a smooth function of the clustering coefficient and average path length of its relational graph; (3) our findings are consistent across many different tasks and datasets; (4) the sweet spot can be identified efficiently; (5) top-performing neural networks have graph structure surprisingly similar to those of real biological neural networks. Our work opens new directions for the design of neural architectures and the understanding on neural networks in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2020, with open-source code</p></details> |

Typically, we first build a unified GNN model with graphs in a given training set and then use this unified model to predict labels of all the unseen graphs in the test set. However, graphs in the same dataset often have dramatically distinct structures, which indicates that a unified model may be sub-optimal given an individual graph. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to develop customized graph neural networks for graph classification. Specifically, we propose a novel customized graph neural network framework, i.e., Customized-GNN. Given a graph sample, Customized-GNN can generate a sample-specific model for this graph based on its structure. Meanwhile, the proposed framework is very general that can be applied to numerous existing graph neural network models. Comprehensive experiments on various graph classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Graph neural networks have been demonstrated to be effective for capturing network structure information, and the learned representations can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on node and graph classification tasks. Besides the different application scenarios, the architectures of graph neural network models also depend on the studied graph types a lot. Graph data studied in research can be generally categorized into two main types, i.e., small graphs vs. giant networks, which differ from each other a lot in the size, instance number and label annotation. Several different types of graph neural network models have been introduced for learning the representations from such different types of graphs already. In this paper, for these two different types of graph data, we will introduce the graph neural networks introduced in recent years. To be more specific, the graph neural networks introduced in this paper include IsoNN, SDBN, LF&ER, GCN, GAT, DifNN, GNL, GraphSage and seGEN. Among these graph neural network models, IsoNN, SDBN and LF&ER are initially proposed for small graphs and the remaining ones are initially proposed for giant networks instead.

One advantage of graph neural network is its ability to incorporate node features into the learning process. However, this prevents graph neural network from being applied into featureless graphs. In this paper, we first analyze the effects of node features on the performance of graph neural network. We show that GNNs work well if there is a strong correlation between node features and node labels. Based on these results, we propose new feature initialization methods that allows to apply graph neural network to non-attributed graphs. Our experimental results show that the artificial features are highly competitive with real features.</p></details> |  |

A Graph Neural Process is defined as a Conditional Neural Process that operates on arbitrary graph data. It takes features of sparsely observed context points as input, and outputs a distribution over target points. We demonstrate graph neural processes in edge imputation and discuss benefits and drawbacks of the method for other application areas. One major benefit of GNPs is the ability to quantify uncertainty in deep learning on graph structures. An additional benefit of this method is the ability to extend graph neural networks to inputs of dynamic sized graphs.</p></details> |  |

Up to now, there have been several surveys on this topic. However, they usually lay emphasis on different angles so that the readers can not see a panorama of the graph neural networks. This survey aims to overcome this limitation, and provide a comprehensive review on the graph neural networks. First of all, we provide a novel taxonomy for the graph neural networks, and then refer to up to 400 relevant literatures to show the panorama of the graph neural networks. All of them are classified into the corresponding categories. In order to drive the graph neural networks into a new stage, we summarize four future research directions so as to overcome the facing challenges. It is expected that more and more scholars can understand and exploit the graph neural networks, and use them in their research community.</p></details> | 55 pages, 7 figures |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and especially those algorithms that capture graph topology through message passing for neighborhood aggregation, have been a leading solution. However, these networks often require substantial computational resources and may not optimally leverage the information contained in the graph's topology, particularly for large-scale or complex graphs. We propose Topology Coordinate Neural Network (TCNN) and Directional Virtual Coordinate Neural Network (DVCNN) as novel and efficient alternatives to message passing GNNs, that directly leverage the graph's topology, sidestepping the computational challenges presented by competing algorithms. Our proposed methods can be viewed as a reprise of classic techniques for graph embedding for neural network feature engineering, but they are novel in that our embedding techniques leverage ideas in Graph Coordinates (GC) that are lacking in current practice. Experimental results, benchmarked against the Open Graph Benchmark Leaderboard, demonstrate that TCNN and DVCNN achieve competitive or superior performance to message passing GNNs. For similar levels of accuracy and ROC-AUC, TCNN and DVCNN need far fewer trainable parameters than contenders of the OGBN Leaderboard. The proposed TCNN architecture requires fewer parameters than any neural network method currently listed in the OGBN Leaderboard for both OGBN-Proteins and OGBN-Products datasets. Conversely, our methods achieve higher performance for a similar number of trainable parameters. By providing an efficient and effective alternative to message passing GNNs, our work expands the toolbox of techniques for graph-based machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted and will be published on Big Data Conference 2023, Data-driven Science for Graphs: Algorithms, Architectures, and Application workshop</p></details> |

| **[Inferring the Graph Structure of Images for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04677v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image datasets such as MNIST are a key benchmark for testing Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures. The images are traditionally represented as a grid graph with each node representing a pixel and edges connecting neighboring pixels (vertically and horizontally). The graph signal is the values (intensities) of each pixel in the image. The graphs are commonly used as input to graph neural networks (e.g., Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (Graph CNNs) [1, 2], Graph Attention Networks (GAT) [3], GatedGCN [4]) to classify the images. In this work, we improve the accuracy of downstream graph neural network tasks by finding alternative graphs to the grid graph and superpixel methods to represent the dataset images, following the approach in [5, 6]. We find row correlation, column correlation, and product graphs for each image in MNIST and Fashion-MNIST using correlations between the pixel values building on the method in [5, 6]. Experiments show that using these different graph representations and features as input into downstream GNN models improves the accuracy over using the traditional grid graph and superpixel methods in the literature.</p></details> |  |

Graph Rewriting investigates the rule-based manipulation of graphs to model complex graph transformations. We propose that, therefore, (i) graph rewriting subsumes GNNs and could serve as formal model to study and compare them, and (ii) the representation of GNNs as graph rewrite systems can help to design and analyse GNNs, their architectures and algorithms. Hence we propose Graph Rewriting Neural Networks (GReNN) as both novel semantic foundation and engineering discipline for GNNs. We develop a case study reminiscent of a Message Passing Neural Network realised as a Groove graph rewriting model and explore its incremental operation in response to dynamic updates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Origi...</summary><p>Originally submitted to ICGT 2023, part of STAF Conferences</p></details> |
| **[Graph in Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00696v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited to process graphs each of whose vertices is represented by a vector or a single value, limited their representing capability to describe complex objects. In this paper, we propose the first GNN (called Graph in Graph Neural (GIG) Network) which can process graph-style data (called GIG sample) whose vertices are further represented by graphs. Given a set of graphs or a data sample whose components can be represented by a set of graphs (called multi-graph data sample), our GIG network starts with a GIG sample generation (GSG) module which encodes the input as a \textbf{GIG sample}, where each GIG vertex includes a graph. Then, a set of GIG hidden layers are stacked, with each consisting of: (1) a GIG vertex-level updating (GVU) module that individually updates the graph in every GIG vertex based on its internal information; and (2) a global-level GIG sample updating (GGU) module that updates graphs in all GIG vertices based on their relationships, making the updated GIG vertices become global context-aware. This way, both internal cues within the graph contained in each GIG vertex and the relationships among GIG vertices could be utilized for down-stream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our GIG network generalizes well for not only various generic graph analysis tasks but also real-world multi-graph data analysis (e.g., human skeleton video-based action recognition), which achieved the new state-of-the-art results on 13 out of 14 evaluated datasets.

| **[Streaming Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.10627v2)** | 2018-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are essential representations of many real-world data such as social networks. Recent years have witnessed the increasing efforts made to extend the neural network models to graph-structured data. These methods, which are usually known as the graph neural networks, have been applied to advance many graphs related tasks such as reasoning dynamics of the physical system, graph classification, and node classification. Most of the existing graph neural network models have been designed for static graphs, while many real-world graphs are inherently dynamic. For example, social networks are naturally evolving as new users joining and new relations being created. Current graph neural network models cannot utilize the dynamic information in dynamic graphs. However, the dynamic information has been proven to enhance the performance of many graph analytic tasks such as community detection and link prediction. Hence, it is necessary to design dedicated graph neural networks for dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DGNN, a new {\bf D}ynamic {\bf G}raph {\bf N}eural {\bf N}etwork model, which can model the dynamic information as the graph evolving. In particular, the proposed framework can keep updating node information by capturing the sequential information of edges (interactions), the time intervals between edges and information propagation coherently. Experimental results on various dynamic graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

| **[Knowledge Enhanced Graph Neural Networks for Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15487v3)** | 2023-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data is omnipresent and has a wide variety of applications, such as in natural science, social networks, or the semantic web. However, while being rich in information, graphs are often noisy and incomplete. As a result, graph completion tasks, such as node classification or link prediction, have gained attention. On one hand, neural methods, such as graph neural networks, have proven to be robust tools for learning rich representations of noisy graphs. On the other hand, symbolic methods enable exact reasoning on graphs.We propose Knowledge Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (KeGNN), a neuro-symbolic framework for graph completion that combines both paradigms as it allows for the integration of prior knowledge into a graph neural network model.Essentially, KeGNN consists of a graph neural network as a base upon which knowledge enhancement layers are stacked with the goal of refining predictions with respect to prior knowledge.We instantiate KeGNN in conjunction with two state-of-the-art graph neural networks, Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks, and evaluate KeGNN on multiple benchmark datasets for node classification.</p></details> |  |

Different from graph Fourier transform, graph wavelet transform can be obtained via a fast algorithm without requiring matrix eigendecomposition with high computational cost. Moreover, graph wavelets are sparse and localized in vertex domain, offering high efficiency and good interpretability for graph convolution. The proposed GWNN significantly outperforms previous spectral graph CNNs in the task of graph-based semi-supervised classification on three benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Binarized Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11147v1)** | 2021-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there have been some breakthroughs in graph analysis by applying the graph neural networks (GNNs) following a neighborhood aggregation scheme, which demonstrate outstanding performance in many tasks. However, we observe that the parameters of the network and the embedding of nodes are represented in real-valued matrices in existing GNN-based graph embedding approaches which may limit the efficiency and scalability of these models. It is well-known that binary vector is usually much more space and time efficient than the real-valued vector. This motivates us to develop a binarized graph neural network to learn the binary representations of the nodes with binary network parameters following the GNN-based paradigm. Our proposed method can be seamlessly integrated into the existing GNN-based embedding approaches to binarize the model parameters and learn the compact embedding. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed binarized graph neural network, namely BGN, is orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of both time and space while matching the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03388v2)** | 2021-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the recent years, Graph Neural Networks have become increasingly popular in network analytic and beyond. With that, their architecture noticeable diverges from the classical multi-layered hierarchical organization of the traditional neural networks. At the same time, many conventional approaches in network science efficiently utilize the hierarchical approaches to account for the hierarchical organization of the networks, and recent works emphasize their critical importance. This paper aims to connect the dots between the traditional Neural Network and the Graph Neural Network architectures as well as the network science approaches, harnessing the power of the hierarchical network organization. A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network architecture is proposed, supplementing the original input network layer with the hierarchy of auxiliary network layers and organizing the computational scheme updating the node features through both - horizontal network connections within each layer as well as the vertical connection between the layers. It enables simultaneous learning of the individual node features along with the aggregated network features at variable resolution and uses them to improve the convergence and stability of the individual node feature learning. The proposed Hierarchical Graph Neural network architecture is successfully evaluated on the network embedding and modeling as well as network classification, node labeling, and community tasks and demonstrates increased efficiency in those.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Learning the Network of Graphs for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03907v1)** | 2022-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in many scenarios with graph-structured data. However, in many real applications, there are three issues when applying GNNs: graphs are unknown, nodes have noisy features, and graphs contain noisy connections. Aiming at solving these problems, we propose a new graph neural network named as GL-GNN. Our model includes multiple sub-modules, each sub-module selects important data features and learn the corresponding key relation graph of data samples when graphs are unknown. GL-GNN further obtains the network of graphs by learning the network of sub-modules. The learned graphs are further fused using an aggregation method over the network of graphs. Our model solves the first issue by simultaneously learning multiple relation graphs of data samples as well as a relation network of graphs, and solves the second and the third issue by selecting important data features as well as important data sample relations. We compare our method with 14 baseline methods on seven datasets when the graph is unknown and 11 baseline methods on two datasets when the graph is known. The results show that our method achieves better accuracies than the baseline methods and is capable of selecting important features and graph edges from the dataset. Our code will be publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Looomo/GL-GNN}.</p></details> |  |

With the development of graph networks, this setup has become a de facto benchmark for a significant body of research. Interestingly, several works have recently shown that in this particular setting, graph neural networks do not perform much better than predefined low-pass filters followed by a linear classifier. However, when learning from little data in a high-dimensional space, it is not surprising that simple and heavily regularized methods are near-optimal. In this paper, we show empirically that in settings with fewer features and more training data, more complex graph networks significantly outperform simple models, and propose a few insights towards the proper choice of graph network architectures. We finally outline the importance of using sufficiently diverse benchmarks (including lower dimensional signals as well) when designing and studying new types of graph neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, accepted at ICASSP 2020</p></details> |
| **[A Graph Neural Network with Negative Message Passing for Graph Coloring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.11164v1)** | 2023-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have received increased attention over the past years due to their promising ability to handle graph-structured data, which can be found in many real-world problems such as recommended systems and drug synthesis. Most existing research focuses on using graph neural networks to solve homophilous problems, but little attention has been paid to heterophily-type problems. In this paper, we propose a graph network model for graph coloring, which is a class of representative heterophilous problems. Different from the conventional graph networks, we introduce negative message passing into the proposed graph neural network for more effective information exchange in handling graph coloring problems. Moreover, a new loss function taking into account the self-information of the nodes is suggested to accelerate the learning process. Experimental studies are carried out to compare the proposed graph model with five state-of-the-art algorithms on ten publicly available graph coloring problems and one real-world application. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed graph neural network.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00596v4)** | 2020-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent years, ranging from image classification and video processing to speech recognition and natural language understanding. The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into four categories, namely recurrent graph neural networks, convolutional graph neural networks, graph autoencoders, and spatial-temporal graph neural networks. We further discuss the applications of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source codes, benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of graph neural networks.

| **[Continuous Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00967v3)** | 2020-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper builds on the connection between graph neural networks and traditional dynamical systems. We propose continuous graph neural networks (CGNN), which generalise existing graph neural networks with discrete dynamics in that they can be viewed as a specific discretisation scheme. The key idea is how to characterise the continuous dynamics of node representations, i.e. the derivatives of node representations, w.r.t. time. Inspired by existing diffusion-based methods on graphs (e.g. PageRank and epidemic models on social networks), we define the derivatives as a combination of the current node representations, the representations of neighbors, and the initial values of the nodes. We propose and analyse two possible dynamics on graphs---including each dimension of node representations (a.k.a. the feature channel) change independently or interact with each other---both with theoretical justification. The proposed continuous graph neural networks are robust to over-smoothing and hence allow us to build deeper networks, which in turn are able to capture the long-range dependencies between nodes. Experimental results on the task of node classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach over competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[EdgeNets:Edge Varying Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07620v3)** | 2021-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by the outstanding performance of neural networks in the structured Euclidean domain, recent years have seen a surge of interest in developing neural networks for graphs and data supported on graphs. The graph is leveraged at each layer of the neural network as a parameterization to capture detail at the node level with a reduced number of parameters and computational complexity. Following this rationale, this paper puts forth a general framework that unifies state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNNs) through the concept of EdgeNet. An EdgeNet is a GNN architecture that allows different nodes to use different parameters to weigh the information of different neighbors. By extrapolating this strategy to more iterations between neighboring nodes, the EdgeNet learns edge- and neighbor-dependent weights to capture local detail. This is a general linear and local operation that a node can perform and encompasses under one formulation all existing graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) as well as graph attention networks (GATs). In writing different GNN architectures with a common language, EdgeNets highlight specific architecture advantages and limitations, while providing guidelines to improve their capacity without compromising their local implementation. An interesting conclusion is the unification of GCNNs and GATs -- approaches that have been so far perceived as separate. In particular, we show that GATs are GCNNs on a graph that is learned from the features. This particularization opens the doors to develop alternative attention mechanisms for improving discriminatory power.</p></details> |  |
| **[Binary Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.15823v2)** | 2021-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful and flexible framework for representation learning on irregular data. As they generalize the operations of classical CNNs on grids to arbitrary topologies, GNNs also bring much of the implementation challenges of their Euclidean counterparts. Model size, memory footprint, and energy consumption are common concerns for many real-world applications. Network binarization allocates a single bit to parameters and activations, thus dramatically reducing the memory requirements (up to 32x compared to single-precision floating-point numbers) and maximizing the benefits of fast SIMD instructions on modern hardware for measurable speedups. However, in spite of the large body of work on binarization for classical CNNs, this area remains largely unexplored in geometric deep learning. In this paper, we present and evaluate different strategies for the binarization of graph neural networks. We show that through careful design of the models, and control of the training process, binary graph neural networks can be trained at only a moderate cost in accuracy on challenging benchmarks. In particular, we present the first dynamic graph neural network in Hamming space, able to leverage efficient k-NN search on binary vectors to speed-up the construction of the dynamic graph. We further verify that the binary models offer significant savings on embedded devices.

The proposed graph unrolling networks expand algorithm unrolling to the graph domain and provide an interpretation of the architecture design from a signal processing perspective. We unroll an iterative denoising algorithm by mapping each iteration into a single network layer where the feed-forward process is equivalent to iteratively denoising graph signals. We train the graph unrolling networks through unsupervised learning, where the input noisy graph signals are used to supervise the networks. By leveraging the learning ability of neural networks, we adaptively capture appropriate priors from input noisy graph signals, instead of manually choosing signal priors. A core component of graph unrolling networks is the edge-weight-sharing graph convolution operation, which parameterizes each edge weight by a trainable kernel function where the trainable parameters are shared by all the edges. The proposed convolution is permutation-equivariant and can flexibly adjust the edge weights to various graph signals. We then consider two special cases of this class of networks, graph unrolling sparse coding (GUSC) and graph unrolling trend filtering (GUTF), by unrolling sparse coding and trend filtering, respectively. To validate the proposed methods, we conduct extensive experiments on both real-world datasets and simulated datasets, and demonstrate that our methods have smaller denoising errors than conventional denoising algorithms and state-of-the-art graph neural networks. For denoising a single smooth graph signal, the normalized mean square error of the proposed networks is around 40% and 60% lower than that of graph Laplacian denoising and graph wavelets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the employment of differentiable loss functions has paved the road to the massive usage of Gradient Descent and related optimization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the development of Graph Neural Drawers (GND), machines that rely on neural computation for constructing efficient and complex maps. GNDs are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) whose learning process can be driven by any provided loss function, such as the ones commonly employed in Graph Drawing. Moreover, we prove that this mechanism can be guided by loss functions computed by means of Feedforward Neural Networks, on the basis of supervision hints that express beauty properties, like the minimization of crossing edges. In this context, we show that GNNs can nicely be enriched by positional features to deal also with unlabelled vertexes. We provide a proof-of-concept by constructing a loss function for the edge-crossing and provide quantitative and qualitative comparisons among different GNN models working under the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transaction of Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS) 2022, Special Issue on Deep Neural Networks for Graphs: Theory, Models, Algorithms and Applications</p></details> |
| **[Graph and graphon neural network stability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12529v4)** | 2021-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are learning architectures that rely on knowledge of the graph structure to generate meaningful representations of large-scale network data. GNN stability is thus important as in real-world scenarios there are typically uncertainties associated with the graph. We analyze GNN stability using kernel objects called graphons. Graphons are both limits of convergent graph sequences and generating models for deterministic and stochastic graphs. Building upon the theory of graphon signal processing, we define graphon neural networks and analyze their stability to graphon perturbations. We then extend this analysis by interpreting the graphon neural network as a generating model for GNNs on deterministic and stochastic graphs instantiated from the original and perturbed graphons. We observe that GNNs are stable to graphon perturbations with a stability bound that decreases asymptotically with the size of the graph. This asymptotic behavior is further demonstrated in an experiment of movie recommendation.</p></details> |  |

As the complexity and adoption of blockchain networks continue to grow, traditional analytical methods are proving inadequate in capturing the intricate relationships and dynamic behaviors of decentralized systems. To address these limitations, deep learning models such as GNNs, GCNs, and CNNs offer robust solutions by leveraging the unique graph-based and temporal structures inherent in blockchain architectures. GNNs and GCNs, in particular, excel in modeling the relational data of blockchain nodes and transactions, making them ideal for applications such as fraud detection, transaction verification, and smart contract analysis. Meanwhile, CNNs can be adapted to analyze blockchain data when represented as structured matrices, revealing hidden temporal and spatial patterns in transaction flows. This paper explores how these models enhance the efficiency, security, and scalability of both linear blockchains and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based systems, providing a comprehensive overview of their strengths and future research directions. By integrating advanced neural network techniques, we aim to demonstrate the potential of these models in revolutionizing blockchain analytics, paving the way for more sophisticated decentralized applications and improved network performance.</p></details> |  |

However, current state-of-the-art neural network models designed for graph learning, e.g. graph convolutional networks (GCN) and graph attention networks (GAT), adequately utilize edge features, especially multi-dimensional edge features. In this paper, we build a new framework for a family of new graph neural network models that can more sufficiently exploit edge features, including those of undirected or multi-dimensional edges. The proposed framework can consolidate current graph neural network models; e.g. graph convolutional networks (GCN) and graph attention networks (GAT). The proposed framework and new models have the following novelties: First, we propose to use doubly stochastic normalization of graph edge features instead of the commonly used row or symmetric normalization approches used in current graph neural networks. Second, we construct new formulas for the operations in each individual layer so that they can handle multi-dimensional edge features. Third, for the proposed new framework, edge features are adaptive across network layers. As a result, our proposed new framework and new models can exploit a rich source of graph information. We apply our new models to graph node classification on several citation networks, whole graph classification, and regression on several molecular datasets. Compared with the current state-of-the-art methods, i.e. GCNs and GAT, our models obtain better performance, which testify to the importance of exploiting edge features in graph neural networks.</p></details> |  |

A large class of graph neural networks follow a standard message-passing paradigm: at every layer, each node state is updated based on an aggregate of messages from its neighborhood. In this work, we propose a novel framework for training graph neural networks, where every node is viewed as a player that can choose to either 'listen', 'broadcast', 'listen and broadcast', or to 'isolate'. The standard message propagation scheme can then be viewed as a special case of this framework where every node 'listens and broadcasts' to all neighbors. Our approach offers a more flexible and dynamic message-passing paradigm, where each node can determine its own strategy based on their state, effectively exploring the graph topology while learning. We provide a theoretical analysis of the new message-passing scheme which is further supported by an extensive empirical analysis on a synthetic dataset and on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Forty-First International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024).

| **[Sampling and Recovery of Graph Signals based on Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01412v1)** | 2020-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose interpretable graph neural networks for sampling and recovery of graph signals, respectively. To take informative measurements, we propose a new graph neural sampling module, which aims to select those vertices that maximally express their corresponding neighborhoods. Such expressiveness can be quantified by the mutual information between vertices' features and neighborhoods' features, which are estimated via a graph neural network. To reconstruct an original graph signal from the sampled measurements, we propose a graph neural recovery module based on the algorithm-unrolling technique. Compared to previous analytical sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are able to flexibly learn a variety of graph signal models from data by leveraging the learning ability of neural networks; compared to previous neural-network-based sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are designed through exploiting specific graph properties and provide interpretability. We further design a new multiscale graph neural network, which is a trainable multiscale graph filter bank and can handle various graph-related learning tasks. The multiscale network leverages the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules to achieve multiscale representations of a graph. In the experiments, we illustrate the effects of the proposed graph neural sampling and recovery modules and find that the modules can flexibly adapt to various graph structures and graph signals. In the task of active-sampling-based semi-supervised learning, the graph neural sampling module improves the classification accuracy over 10% in Cora dataset. We further validate the proposed multiscale graph neural network on several standard datasets for both vertex and graph classification. The results show that our method consistently improves the classification accuracies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Diffusion Networks for Semi-supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.09698v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) is a pioneering model for graph-based semi-supervised learning. However, GCN does not perform well on sparsely-labeled graphs. Its two-layer version cannot effectively propagate the label information to the whole graph structure (i.e., the under-smoothing problem) while its deep version over-smoothens and is hard to train (i.e., the over-smoothing problem). To solve these two issues, we propose a new graph neural network called GND-Nets (for Graph Neural Diffusion Networks) that exploits the local and global neighborhood information of a vertex in a single layer. Exploiting the shallow network mitigates the over-smoothing problem while exploiting the local and global neighborhood information mitigates the under-smoothing problem. The utilization of the local and global neighborhood information of a vertex is achieved by a new graph diffusion method called neural diffusions, which integrate neural networks into the conventional linear and nonlinear graph diffusions. The adoption of neural networks makes neural diffusions adaptable to different datasets. Extensive experiments on various sparsely-labeled graphs verify the effectiveness and efficiency of GND-Nets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages |

They are presented here as generalizations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in which individual layers contain banks of graph convolutional filters instead of banks of classical convolutional filters. Otherwise, GNNs operate as CNNs. Filters are composed with pointwise nonlinearities and stacked in layers. It is shown that GNN architectures exhibit equivariance to permutation and stability to graph deformations. These properties help explain the good performance of GNNs that can be observed empirically. It is also shown that if graphs converge to a limit object, a graphon, GNNs converge to a corresponding limit object, a graphon neural network. This convergence justifies the transferability of GNNs across networks with different number of nodes. Concepts are illustrated by the application of GNNs to recommendation systems, decentralized collaborative control, and wireless communication networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the IEEE</p></details> |

Much work is dedicated to empowering GNNs with the adaptive locality ability, which enables measuring the importance of neighboring nodes to the target node by a node-specific mechanism. However, the current node-specific mechanisms are deficient in distinguishing the importance of nodes in the topology structure. We believe that the structural importance of neighboring nodes is closely related to their importance in aggregation. In this paper, we introduce discrete graph curvature (the Ricci curvature) to quantify the strength of structural connection of pairwise nodes. And we propose Curvature Graph Neural Network (CGNN), which effectively improves the adaptive locality ability of GNNs by leveraging the structural property of graph curvature. To improve the adaptability of curvature to various datasets, we explicitly transform curvature into the weights of neighboring nodes by the necessary Negative Curvature Processing Module and Curvature Normalization Module. Then, we conduct numerous experiments on various synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. The experimental results on synthetic datasets show that CGNN effectively exploits the topology structure information, and the performance is improved significantly.

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to exploit the relational inductive bias exhibited in graphs; they have been shown to outperform other forms of neural networks in scenarios where structure information supplements node features. The most common GNN architecture aggregates information from neighborhoods based on message passing. Its generality has made it broadly applicable. In this paper, we focus on a special, yet widely used, type of graphs -- DAGs -- and inject a stronger inductive bias -- partial ordering -- into the neural network design. We propose the \emph{directed acyclic graph neural network}, DAGNN, an architecture that processes information according to the flow defined by the partial order. DAGNN can be considered a framework that entails earlier works as special cases (e.g., models for trees and models updating node representations recurrently), but we identify several crucial components that prior architectures lack. We perform comprehensive experiments, including ablation studies, on representative DAG datasets (i.e., source code, neural architectures, and probabilistic graphical models) and demonstrate the superiority of DAGNN over simpler DAG architectures as well as general graph architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2021.

Due to the finite nature of the underlying recurrent structure, current GNN methods may struggle to capture long-range dependencies in underlying graphs. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a graph learning framework, called Implicit Graph Neural Networks (IGNN), where predictions are based on the solution of a fixed-point equilibrium equation involving implicitly defined "state" vectors. We use the Perron-Frobenius theory to derive sufficient conditions that ensure well-posedness of the framework. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we derive a tractable projected gradient descent method to train the framework. Experiments on a comprehensive range of tasks show that IGNNs consistently capture long-range dependencies and outperform the state-of-the-art GNN models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2020 at: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/hash/8b5c8441a8ff8e151b191c53c1842a38-Abstract.html</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Networks Go Forward-Forward](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05282v1)** | 2023-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the Graph Forward-Forward (GFF) algorithm, an extension of the Forward-Forward procedure to graphs, able to handle features distributed over a graph's nodes. This allows training graph neural networks with forward passes only, without backpropagation. Our method is agnostic to the message-passing scheme, and provides a more biologically plausible learning scheme than backpropagation, while also carrying computational advantages. With GFF, graph neural networks are trained greedily layer by layer, using both positive and negative samples. We run experiments on 11 standard graph property prediction tasks, showing how GFF provides an effective alternative to backpropagation for training graph neural networks. This shows in particular that this procedure is remarkably efficient in spite of combining the per-layer training with the locality of the processing in a GNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[GMNN: Graph Markov Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06214v3)** | 2020-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies semi-supervised object classification in relational data, which is a fundamental problem in relational data modeling. The problem has been extensively studied in the literature of both statistical relational learning (e.g. relational Markov networks) and graph neural networks (e.g. graph convolutional networks). Statistical relational learning methods can effectively model the dependency of object labels through conditional random fields for collective classification, whereas graph neural networks learn effective object representations for classification through end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose the Graph Markov Neural Network (GMNN) that combines the advantages of both worlds. A GMNN models the joint distribution of object labels with a conditional random field, which can be effectively trained with the variational EM algorithm. In the E-step, one graph neural network learns effective object representations for approximating the posterior distributions of object labels. In the M-step, another graph neural network is used to model the local label dependency. Experiments on object classification, link classification, and unsupervised node representation learning show that GMNN achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | icml 2019 |

Motivated by their empirical performance, prior works have developed generalization bounds for graph neural networks, which scale with graph structures in terms of the maximum degree. In this paper, we present generalization bounds that instead scale with the largest singular value of the graph neural network's feature diffusion matrix. These bounds are numerically much smaller than prior bounds for real-world graphs. We also construct a lower bound of the generalization gap that matches our upper bound asymptotically. To achieve these results, we analyze a unified model that includes prior works' settings (i.e., convolutional and message-passing networks) and new settings (i.e., graph isomorphism networks). Our key idea is to measure the stability of graph neural networks against noise perturbations using Hessians. Empirically, we find that Hessian-based measurements correlate with the observed generalization gaps of graph neural networks accurately. Optimizing noise stability properties for fine-tuning pretrained graph neural networks also improves test performance on several graph-level classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages.

| **[Continuous Spiking Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01897v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous graph neural networks (CGNNs) have garnered significant attention due to their ability to generalize existing discrete graph neural networks (GNNs) by introducing continuous dynamics. They typically draw inspiration from diffusion-based methods to introduce a novel propagation scheme, which is analyzed using ordinary differential equations (ODE). However, the implementation of CGNNs requires significant computational power, making them challenging to deploy on battery-powered devices. Inspired by recent spiking neural networks (SNNs), which emulate a biological inference process and provide an energy-efficient neural architecture, we incorporate the SNNs with CGNNs in a unified framework, named Continuous Spiking Graph Neural Networks (COS-GNN). We employ SNNs for graph node representation at each time step, which are further integrated into the ODE process along with time. To enhance information preservation and mitigate information loss in SNNs, we introduce the high-order structure of COS-GNN, which utilizes the second-order ODE for spiking representation and continuous propagation. Moreover, we provide the theoretical proof that COS-GNN effectively mitigates the issues of exploding and vanishing gradients, enabling us to capture long-range dependencies between nodes. Experimental results on graph-based learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed COS-GNN over competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements utilize graph convolutional neural networks to extract features within graph structures. Despite promising results, these methods face challenges in real-world applications due to sparse features, resulting in inefficient resource utilization. Recent studies draw inspiration from the mammalian brain and employ spiking neural networks to model and learn graph structures. However, these approaches are limited to traditional Von Neumann-based computing systems, which still face hardware inefficiencies. In this study, we present a fully neuromorphic implementation of spiking graph neural networks designed for Loihi 2. We optimize network parameters using Lava Bayesian Optimization, a novel hyperparameter optimization system compatible with neuromorphic computing architectures. We showcase the performance benefits of combining neuromorphic Bayesian optimization with our approach for citation graph classification using fixed-precision spiking neurons.

| **[Network In Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.11638v1)** | 2021-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown success in learning from graph structured data containing node/edge feature information, with application to social networks, recommendation, fraud detection and knowledge graph reasoning. In this regard, various strategies have been proposed in the past to improve the expressiveness of GNNs. For example, one straightforward option is to simply increase the parameter size by either expanding the hid-den dimension or increasing the number of GNN layers. However, wider hidden layers can easily lead to overfitting, and incrementally adding more GNN layers can potentially result in over-smoothing.In this paper, we present a model-agnostic methodology, namely Network In Graph Neural Network (NGNN ), that allows arbitrary GNN models to increase their model capacity by making the model deeper. However, instead of adding or widening GNN layers, NGNN deepens a GNN model by inserting non-linear feedforward neural network layer(s) within each GNN layer. An analysis of NGNN as applied to a GraphSage base GNN on ogbn-products data demonstrate that it can keep the model stable against either node feature or graph structure perturbations. Furthermore, wide-ranging evaluation results on both node classification and link prediction tasks show that NGNN works reliably across diverse GNN architectures.For instance, it improves the test accuracy of GraphSage on the ogbn-products by 1.6% and improves the hits@100 score of SEAL on ogbl-ppa by 7.08% and the hits@20 score of GraphSage+Edge-Attr on ogbl-ppi by 6.22%.

Recent research has focused on stacking multiple layers like in convolutional neural networks for the increased expressive power of graph convolution networks. However, simply stacking multiple graph convolution layers lead to issues like vanishing gradient, over-fitting and over-smoothing. Such problems are much less when using shallower networks, even though the shallow networks have lower expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel Multipath Graph convolutional neural network that aggregates the output of multiple different shallow networks. We train and test our model on various benchmarks datasets for the task of node property prediction. Results show that the proposed method not only attains increased test accuracy but also requires fewer training epochs to converge.

Successful learning from network data is built upon methods that effectively exploit this graph structure. In this work, we leverage graph signal processing to characterize the representation space of graph neural networks (GNNs). We discuss the role of graph convolutional filters in GNNs and show that any architecture built with such filters has the fundamental properties of permutation equivariance and stability to changes in the topology. These two properties offer insight about the workings of GNNs and help explain their scalability and transferability properties which, coupled with their local and distributed nature, make GNNs powerful tools for learning in physical networks. We also introduce GNN extensions using edge-varying and autoregressive moving average graph filters and discuss their properties.

However, the existing pre-training methods do not take network evolution into consideration. This paper proposes a pre-training method on dynamic graph neural networks (PT-DGNN), which uses dynamic attributed graph generation tasks to simultaneously learn the structure, semantics, and evolution features of the graph. The method includes two steps: 1) dynamic sub-graph sampling, and 2) pre-training with dynamic attributed graph generation task. Comparative experiments on three realistic dynamic network datasets show that the proposed method achieves the best results on the link prediction fine-tuning task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks With Lifting-based Adaptive Graph Wavelets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01660v3)** | 2022-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral-based graph neural networks (SGNNs) have been attracting increasing attention in graph representation learning. However, existing SGNNs are limited in implementing graph filters with rigid transforms (e.g., graph Fourier or predefined graph wavelet transforms) and cannot adapt to signals residing on graphs and tasks at hand. In this paper, we propose a novel class of graph neural networks that realizes graph filters with adaptive graph wavelets. Specifically, the adaptive graph wavelets are learned with neural network-parameterized lifting structures, where structure-aware attention-based lifting operations (i.e., prediction and update operations) are developed to jointly consider graph structures and node features. We propose to lift based on diffusion wavelets to alleviate the structural information loss induced by partitioning non-bipartite graphs. By design, the locality and sparsity of the resulting wavelet transform as well as the scalability of the lifting structure are guaranteed. We further derive a soft-thresholding filtering operation by learning sparse graph representations in terms of the learned wavelets, yielding a localized, efficient, and scalable wavelet-based graph filters. To ensure that the learned graph representations are invariant to node permutations, a layer is employed at the input of the networks to reorder the nodes according to their local topology information. We evaluate the proposed networks in both node-level and graph-level representation learning tasks on benchmark citation and bioinformatics graph datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed networks over existing SGNNs in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Deeper Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09296v1)** | 2020-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have shown significant success in the field of graph representation learning. Graph convolutions perform neighborhood aggregation and represent one of the most important graph operations. Nevertheless, one layer of these neighborhood aggregation methods only consider immediate neighbors, and the performance decreases when going deeper to enable larger receptive fields. Several recent studies attribute this performance deterioration to the over-smoothing issue, which states that repeated propagation makes node representations of different classes indistinguishable. In this work, we study this observation systematically and develop new insights towards deeper graph neural networks. First, we provide a systematical analysis on this issue and argue that the key factor compromising the performance significantly is the entanglement of representation transformation and propagation in current graph convolution operations. After decoupling these two operations, deeper graph neural networks can be used to learn graph node representations from larger receptive fields. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the above observation when building very deep models, which can serve as a rigorous and gentle description of the over-smoothing issue. Based on our theoretical and empirical analysis, we propose Deep Adaptive Graph Neural Network (DAGNN) to adaptively incorporate information from large receptive fields. A set of experiments on citation, co-authorship, and co-purchase datasets have confirmed our analysis and insights and demonstrated the superiority of our proposed methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, KDD2020 |

AgentNet is inspired by sublinear algorithms, featuring a computational complexity that is independent of the graph size. The architecture of AgentNet differs fundamentally from the architectures of traditional graph neural networks. In AgentNet, some trained \textit{neural agents} intelligently walk the graph, and then collectively decide on the output. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis of AgentNet: We show that the agents can learn to systematically explore their neighborhood and that AgentNet can distinguish some structures that are even indistinguishable by 2-WL. Moreover, AgentNet is able to separate any two graphs which are sufficiently different in terms of subgraphs. We confirm these theoretical results with synthetic experiments on hard-to-distinguish graphs and real-world graph classification tasks. In both cases, we compare favorably not only to standard GNNs but also to computationally more expensive GNN extensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 6 figures, ICLR 2023</p></details> |

NTK is a major step forward in the theoretical deep learning because it allows researchers to use traditional mathematical tools to analyze properties of deep neural networks and to explain various neural network techniques from a theoretical view. A natural extension of NTK on graph learning is \textit{Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK)}, and researchers have already provide GNTK formulation for graph-level regression and show empirically that this kernel method can achieve similar accuracy as GNNs on various bioinformatics datasets [dhs+19]. The remaining question now is whether solving GNTK regression is equivalent to training an infinite-wide multi-layer GNN using gradient descent. In this paper, we provide three new theoretical results. First, we formally prove this equivalence for graph-level regression. Second, we present the first GNTK formulation for node-level regression. Finally, we prove the equivalence for node-level regression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Variate Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20311v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs): layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous, data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.</p></details> |  |

The neural network is trained to match the distribution of a class of random graphs by way of a moment estimator. The features used for training are graphlets, subgraph counts of small order. The neural network accepts random noise as input and outputs vector representations for nodes in the graph. Random graphs are then realized by applying a kernel to the representations. Graphs produced this way are demonstrated to be able to imitate data from chemistry, medicine, and social networks. The produced graphs are similar enough to the target data to be able to fool discriminator neural networks otherwise capable of separating classes of random graphs.</p></details> |  |

The core learning process requires the initialization of model weight matrices within each GNN layer, which is typically accomplished via classic initialization methods such as Xavier initialization. However, these methods were originally motivated to stabilize the variance of hidden embeddings and gradients across layers of Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to avoid vanishing gradients and maintain steady information flow. In contrast, within the GNN context classical initializations disregard the impact of the input graph structure and message passing on variance. In this paper, we analyze the variance of forward and backward propagation across GNN layers and show that the variance instability of GNN initializations comes from the combined effect of the activation function, hidden dimension, graph structure and message passing. To better account for these influence factors, we propose a new initialization method for Variance Instability Reduction within GNN Optimization (Virgo), which naturally tends to equate forward and backward variances across successive layers. We conduct comprehensive experiments on 15 datasets to show that Virgo can lead to superior model performance and more stable variance at initialization on node classification, link prediction and graph classification tasks.

Geometric techniques to extract such representations have poor scaling over large graph size, and recent advances in Graph Neural Network (GNN) algorithms have limited ability to reflect graph distance information beyond the first degree neighborhood. To enable this highly desired capability, we propose a technique to learn Isometric Graph Neural Networks (IGNN), which requires changing the input representation space and loss function to enable any GNN algorithm to generate representations that reflect distances between nodes. We experiment with the isometric technique on several GNN architectures for modeling multiple prediction tasks on multiple datasets. In addition to an improvement in AUC-ROC as high as $43\%$ in these experiments, we observe a consistent and substantial improvement as high as 400% in Kendall's Tau (KT), a measure that directly reflects distance information, demonstrating that the learned embeddings do account for graph distances.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained a lot of attention in recent years for their ability to perform well on a range of network science tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. Despite the popularity of graph neural networks and the proven benefits of dynamic network models, there has been little focus on graph neural networks for dynamic networks. To address the challenges resulting from the fact that this research crosses diverse fields as well as to survey dynamic graph neural networks, this work is split into two main parts.

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved promising results in graph analysis tasks. Some state-of-the-art GNN models have been proposed, e.g., Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), etc. Despite these successes, most of the GNNs only have shallow structure. This causes the low expressive power of the GNNs. To fully utilize the power of the deep neural network, some deep GNNs have been proposed recently. However, the design of deep GNNs requires significant architecture engineering. In this work, we propose a method to automate the deep GNNs design. In our proposed method, we add a new type of skip connection to the GNNs search space to encourage feature reuse and alleviate the vanishing gradient problem. We also allow our evolutionary algorithm to increase the layers of GNNs during the evolution to generate deeper networks. We evaluate our method in the graph node classification task.

They are developed to incorporate the geometric and topological information of non-Euclidian data into the end-to-end deep learning architectures. Motivated by the recent success of discrete Ricci curvature in graph neural network (GNNs), we propose TorGNN, an analytic Torsion enhanced Graph Neural Network model. The essential idea is to characterize graph local structures with an analytic torsion based weight formula. Mathematically, analytic torsion is a topological invariant that can distinguish spaces which are homotopy equivalent but not homeomorphic. In our TorGNN, for each edge, a corresponding local simplicial complex is identified, then the analytic torsion (for this local simplicial complex) is calculated, and further used as a weight (for this edge) in message-passing process. Our TorGNN model is validated on link prediction tasks from sixteen different types of networks and node classification tasks from three types of networks. It has been found that our TorGNN can achieve superior performance on both tasks, and outperform various state-of-the-art models. This demonstrates that analytic torsion is a highly efficient topological invariant in the characterization of graph structures and can significantly boost the performance of GNNs.</p></details> |  |

Current GNN architectures assume ideal scenarios and ignore link fluctuations that occur due to environment, human factors, or external attacks. In these situations, the GNN fails to address its distributed task if the topological randomness is not considered accordingly. To overcome this issue, we put forth the stochastic graph neural network (SGNN) model: a GNN where the distributed graph convolution module accounts for the random network changes. Since stochasticity brings in a new learning paradigm, we conduct a statistical analysis on the SGNN output variance to identify conditions the learned filters should satisfy for achieving robust transference to perturbed scenarios, ultimately revealing the explicit impact of random link losses. We further develop a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based learning process for the SGNN and derive conditions on the learning rate under which this learning process converges to a stationary point. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings and compare the benefits of SGNN robust transference with a conventional GNN that ignores graph perturbations during learning.</p></details> |  |

Similarly, adding early exit mechanisms to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the go-to models for graph-structured data, allows for dynamic trading depth for confidence on simple graphs while maintaining full-depth accuracy on harder and more complex graphs to capture intricate relationships. Although early exits have proven effective across various deep learning domains, their potential within GNNs in scenarios that require deep architectures while resisting over-smoothing and over-squashing remains largely unexplored. We unlock that potential by first introducing Symmetric-Anti-Symmetric Graph Neural Networks (SAS-GNN), whose symmetry-based inductive biases mitigate these issues and yield stable intermediate representations that can be useful to allow early exiting in GNNs. Building on this backbone, we present Early-Exit Graph Neural Networks (EEGNNs), which append confidence-aware exit heads that allow on-the-fly termination of propagation based on each node or the entire graph. Experiments show that EEGNNs preserve robust performance as depth grows and deliver competitive accuracy on heterophilic and long-range benchmarks, matching attention-based and asynchronous message-passing models while substantially reducing computation and latency. We plan to release the code to reproduce our experiments.</p></details> | 37 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Incorporating Heterophily into Graph Neural Networks for Graph Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.07678v2)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often assume strong homophily for graph classification, seldom considering heterophily, which means connected nodes tend to have different class labels and dissimilar features. In real-world scenarios, graphs may have nodes that exhibit both homophily and heterophily. Failing to generalize to this setting makes many GNNs underperform in graph classification. In this paper, we address this limitation by identifying three effective designs and develop a novel GNN architecture called IHGNN (short for Incorporating Heterophily into Graph Neural Networks). These designs include the combination of integration and separation of the ego- and neighbor-embeddings of nodes, adaptive aggregation of node embeddings from different layers, and differentiation between different node embeddings for constructing the graph-level readout function. We empirically validate IHGNN on various graph datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art GNNs for graph classification.</p></details> | 8 pages |

To the best of our knowledge this has never been tried before. Our preliminary findings are potentially profound. In a weakly-supervised setting, that is, without problem specific feature engineering, Graph Neural Networks can learn features of satisfiability.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile the approximate calculation of fractional order gradients also overcomes the high computational complexity of fractional order derivations.

However, these methods suffer from limited performance because of the hand-crafted combinatorial features of graphs. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art method in downstream graph-related tasks due to their superior performance. Most GNNs are based on Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) frameworks. However, recent studies show that MPNNs can not exceed the power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm in graph isomorphism test. To address the limitations of existing graph kernel and GNN methods, in this paper, we propose a novel GNN framework, termed \textit{Kernel Graph Neural Networks} (KerGNNs), which integrates graph kernels into the message passing process of GNNs. Inspired by convolution filters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), KerGNNs adopt trainable hidden graphs as graph filters which are combined with subgraphs to update node embeddings using graph kernels. In addition, we show that MPNNs can be viewed as special cases of KerGNNs. We apply KerGNNs to multiple graph-related tasks and use cross-validation to make fair comparisons with benchmarks. We show that our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the potential to increase the representation ability of GNNs. We also show that the trained graph filters in KerGNNs can reveal the local graph structures of the dataset, which significantly improves the model interpretability compared with conventional GNN models.</p></details> |  |

Several substantial techniques mapping morphological, structural and functional brain connectivities were developed to create a comprehensive road map of neuronal activities in the human brain -namely brain graph.

| **[How hard is to distinguish graphs with graph neural networks?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06649v2)** | 2020-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A hallmark of graph neural networks is their ability to distinguish the isomorphism class of their inputs. This study derives hardness results for the classification variant of graph isomorphism in the message-passing model (MPNN). MPNN encompasses the majority of graph neural networks used today and is universal when nodes are given unique features. The analysis relies on the introduced measure of communication capacity. Capacity measures how much information the nodes of a network can exchange during the forward pass and depends on the depth, message-size, global state, and width of the architecture. It is shown that the capacity of MPNN needs to grow linearly with the number of nodes so that a network can distinguish trees and quadratically for general connected graphs. The derived bounds concern both worst- and average-case behavior and apply to networks with/without unique features and adaptive architecture -- they are also up to two orders of magnitude tighter than those given by simpler arguments. An empirical study involving 12 graph classification tasks and 420 networks reveals strong alignment between actual performance and theoretical predictions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Network Tomography with Path-Centric Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16430v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network tomography is a crucial problem in network monitoring, where the observable path performance metric values are used to infer the unobserved ones, making it essential for tasks such as route selection, fault diagnosis, and traffic control. However, most existing methods either assume complete knowledge of network topology and metric formulas-an unrealistic expectation in many real-world scenarios with limited observability-or rely entirely on black-box end-to-end models. To tackle this, in this paper, we argue that a good network tomography requires synergizing the knowledge from both data and appropriate inductive bias from (partial) prior knowledge. To see this, we propose Deep Network Tomography (DeepNT), a novel framework that leverages a path-centric graph neural network to predict path performance metrics without relying on predefined hand-crafted metrics, assumptions, or the real network topology. The path-centric graph neural network learns the path embedding by inferring and aggregating the embeddings of the sequence of nodes that compose this path. Training path-centric graph neural networks requires learning the neural netowrk parameters and network topology under discrete constraints induced by the observed path performance metrics, which motivates us to design a learning objective that imposes connectivity and sparsity constraints on topology and path performance triangle inequality on path performance. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of DeepNT in predicting performance metrics and inferring graph topology compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage neural networks to model complex graph structures. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network (KAN) has emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), offering improved accuracy and interpretability with fewer parameters. In this paper, we propose the integration of KANs into Signed Graph Convolutional Networks (SGCNs), leading to the development of KAN-enhanced SGCNs (KASGCN). We evaluate KASGCN on tasks such as signed community detection and link sign prediction to improve embedding quality in signed networks. Our experimental results indicate that KASGCN exhibits competitive or comparable performance to standard SGCNs across the tasks evaluated, with performance variability depending on the specific characteristics of the signed graph and the choice of parameter settings. These findings suggest that KASGCNs hold promise for enhancing signed graph analysis with context-dependent effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

We explore two widely utilized types of graph neural networks: graph convolutional neural networks and message passing graph neural networks. Prior to this study, existing bounds on the generalization error in the over-parametrized regime were uninformative, limiting our understanding of over-parameterized network performance. Our novel approach involves deriving upper bounds within the mean-field regime for evaluating the generalization error of these graph neural networks. We establish upper bounds with a convergence rate of $O(1/n)$, where $n$ is the number of graph samples. These upper bounds offer a theoretical assurance of the networks' performance on unseen data in the challenging over-parameterized regime and overall contribute to our understanding of their performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICML 2024</p></details> |

They are built from layers of graph convolutions which serve as a powerful inductive bias for describing the flow of information among the vertices. Often, more than one data modality is available. This work considers a setting in which several graphs have the same vertex set and a common vertex-level learning task. This generalizes standard GNN models to GNNs with several graph operators that do not commute. We may call this model graph-tuple neural networks (GtNN). In this work, we develop the mathematical theory to address the stability and transferability of GtNNs using properties of non-commuting non-expansive operators. We develop a limit theory of graphon-tuple neural networks and use it to prove a universal transferability theorem that guarantees that all graph-tuple neural networks are transferable on convergent graph-tuple sequences. In particular, there is no non-transferable energy under the convergence we consider here. Our theoretical results extend well-known transferability theorems for GNNs to the case of several simultaneous graphs (GtNNs) and provide a strict improvement on what is currently known even in the GNN case. We illustrate our theoretical results with simple experiments on synthetic and real-world data. To this end, we derive a training procedure that provably enforces the stability of the resulting model.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

In addition to real-valued GNNs, quaternion GNNs also perform well on tasks on graph-structured data. With the aim of reducing the energy footprint, we reduce the model size while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of the original-sized GNNs. This paper introduces Quaternion Message Passing Neural Networks (QMPNNs), a framework that leverages quaternion space to compute node representations. Our approach offers a generalizable method for incorporating quaternion representations into GNN architectures at one-fourth of the original parameter count. Furthermore, we present a novel perspective on Graph Lottery Tickets, redefining their applicability within the context of GNNs and QMPNNs. We specifically aim to find the initialization lottery from the subnetwork of the GNNs that can achieve comparable performance to the original GNN upon training. Thereby reducing the trainable model parameters even further. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed QMPNN framework and LTH for both GNNs and QMPNNs, we evaluate their performance on real-world datasets across three fundamental graph-based tasks: node classification, link prediction, and graph classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, accepted at PAKDD 2025</p></details> |

In particular, there is a strong interest in exploring the possibilities in performing convolution on graphs using an extension of the GNN architecture, generally referred to as Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvGNN). Convolution on graphs has been achieved mainly in two forms: spectral and spatial convolutions. Due to the higher flexibility in exploring and exploiting the graph structure of data, there is recently an increasing interest in investigating the possibilities that the spatial approach can offer. The idea of finding a way to adapt the network behaviour to the inputs they process to maximize the total performances has aroused much interest in the neural networks literature over the years. This paper presents a novel method to adapt the behaviour of a ConvGNN to the input proposing a method to perform spatial convolution on graphs using input-specific filters, which are dynamically generated from nodes feature vectors. The experimental assessment confirms the capabilities of the proposed approach, which achieves satisfying results using a low number of filters.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been published in its final version on \textit{Pattern Recognition} journal with DOI https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2023.109867 in Open Access mode.

Inspired by recently powerful graph mining methods like skip-gram models and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), existing approaches focus on generating temporal node embeddings sequentially with nodes' sequential interactions. However, the sequential modeling of previous approaches cannot handle the transition structure between nodes' neighbors with limited memorization capacity. Detailedly, an effective method for the transition structures is required to both model nodes' personalized patterns adaptively and capture node dynamics accordingly. In this paper, we propose a method, namely Transition Propagation Graph Neural Networks (TIP-GNN), to tackle the challenges of encoding nodes' transition structures. The proposed TIP-GNN focuses on the bilevel graph structure in temporal networks: besides the explicit interaction graph, a node's sequential interactions can also be constructed as a transition graph. Based on the bilevel graph, TIP-GNN further encodes transition structures by multi-step transition propagation and distills information from neighborhoods by a bilevel graph convolution. Experimental results over various temporal networks reveal the efficiency of our TIP-GNN, with at most 7.2\% improvements of accuracy on temporal link prediction. Extensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness and limitations of the transition propagation module.

Among the different variants of graph neural networks, graph attention networks (GATs) have been applied with great success to different tasks. In the GAT model, each node assigns an importance score to its neighbors using an attention mechanism. However, similar to other graph neural networks, GATs aggregate messages from nodes that belong to different classes, and therefore produce node representations that are not well separated with respect to the different classes, which might hurt their performance. In this work, to alleviate this problem, we propose a new technique that can be incorporated into any graph attention model to encourage higher attention scores between nodes that share the same class label.

| **[Improving Graph Neural Networks with Simple Architecture Design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.07634v1)** | 2021-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks have emerged as a useful tool to learn on the data by applying additional constraints based on the graph structure. These graphs are often created with assumed intrinsic relations between the entities. In recent years, there have been tremendous improvements in the architecture design, pushing the performance up in various prediction tasks. In general, these neural architectures combine layer depth and node feature aggregation steps. This makes it challenging to analyze the importance of features at various hops and the expressiveness of the neural network layers. As different graph datasets show varying levels of homophily and heterophily in features and class label distribution, it becomes essential to understand which features are important for the prediction tasks without any prior information. In this work, we decouple the node feature aggregation step and depth of graph neural network and introduce several key design strategies for graph neural networks. More specifically, we propose to use softmax as a regularizer and "Soft-Selector" of features aggregated from neighbors at different hop distances; and "Hop-Normalization" over GNN layers. Combining these techniques, we present a simple and shallow model, Feature Selection Graph Neural Network (FSGNN), and show empirically that the proposed model outperforms other state of the art GNN models and achieves up to 64% improvements in accuracy on node classification tasks. Moreover, analyzing the learned soft-selection parameters of the model provides a simple way to study the importance of features in the prediction tasks. Finally, we demonstrate with experiments that the model is scalable for large graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges.</p></details> |  |

However, the observed graph represents only one possible realization. In many applications, the graph may encounter uncertainties, such as having erroneous or missing edges, as well as edge weights that provide little informative value. To address these challenges and capture additional information previously absent in the observed graph, we introduce latent variables to parameterize and generate multiple graphs. We obtain the maximum likelihood estimate of the network parameters in an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework based on the multiple graphs. Specifically, we iteratively determine the distribution of the graphs using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, incorporating the principles of PAC-Bayesian theory. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements in performance against baseline models on node classification for heterogeneous graphs and graph regression on chemistry datasets.</p></details> |  |

We interpret neural network layers as graph-based transformations, where neurons act as pairwise functions between inputs and learned anchor points. Within this formulation, we establish conditions under which layer outputs are sufficient for the layer inputs, that is, each layer preserves the conditional distribution of the target variable given the input variable. We explore two theoretical paths under this graph-based view. The first path assumes dense anchor points and shows that asymptotic sufficiency holds in the infinite-width limit and is preserved throughout training. The second path, more aligned with practical architectures, proves exact or approximate sufficiency in finite-width networks by assuming region-separated input distributions and constructing appropriate anchor points. This path can ensure the sufficiency property for an infinite number of layers, and provide error bounds on the optimal loss for both regression and classification tasks using standard neural networks. Our framework covers fully connected layers, general pairwise functions, ReLU and sigmoid activations, and convolutional neural networks. Overall, this work bridges statistical sufficiency, graph-theoretic representations, and deep learning, providing a new statistical understanding of neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages main + 10 pages appendix, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Typical graph neural networks focus on modeling the local dependencies when aggregating features of neighboring nodes, and obtain the representation for the entire graph by aggregating node features. Such methods have two potential limitations: 1) the global node saliency w.r.t. graph classification is not explicitly modeled, which is crucial since different nodes may have different semantic relevance to graph classification; 2) the graph representation directly aggregated from node features may have limited effectiveness to reflect graph-level information. In this work, we propose the Saliency-Aware Regularized Graph Neural Network (SAR-GNN) for graph classification, which consists of two core modules: 1) a traditional graph neural network serving as the backbone for learning node features and 2) the Graph Neural Memory designed to distill a compact graph representation from node features of the backbone. We first estimate the global node saliency by measuring the semantic similarity between the compact graph representation and node features. Then the learned saliency distribution is leveraged to regularize the neighborhood aggregation of the backbone, which facilitates the message passing of features for salient nodes and suppresses the less relevant nodes. Thus, our model can learn more effective graph representation. We demonstrate the merits of SAR-GNN by extensive experiments on seven datasets across various types of graph data. Code will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Artificial Intelligence Journal with minor revision</p></details> |
