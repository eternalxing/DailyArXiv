| **[TROLL: Trust Regions improve Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03817v3)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) with PPO-like clip objectives has become the standard choice for reward-based fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). Although recent work has explored improved estimators of advantages and normalization, the clipping mechanism itself has remained untouched. Originally introduced as a proxy for principled KL-based trust regions, clipping is a crude approximation that often causes unstable updates and suboptimal performance. We replace the clip objective with a novel discrete differentiable trust region projection, which provides principled token-level KL constraints. The projection operates on a sparse subset of the model's most important token logits to balance computational cost and projection effectiveness. Our approach, Trust Region Optimization for Large Language models (TROLL), serves as a direct replacement for PPO-like clipping during training and does not alter the model's inference behavior. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks, model families, as well as advantage-estimation methods, TROLL consistently outperforms PPO-like clipping in terms of training speed, stability, and final success rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Find the Fruit: Zero-Shot Sim2Real RL for Occlusion-Aware Plant Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16547v3)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous harvesting in the open presents a complex manipulation problem. In most scenarios, an autonomous system has to deal with significant occlusion and require interaction in the presence of large structural uncertainties (every plant is different). Perceptual and modeling uncertainty make design of reliable manipulation controllers for harvesting challenging, resulting in poor performance during deployment. We present a sim2real reinforcement learning (RL) framework for occlusion-aware plant manipulation, where a policy is learned entirely in simulation to reposition stems and leaves to reveal target fruit(s). In our proposed approach, we decouple high-level kinematic planning from low-level compliant control which simplifies the sim2real transfer. This decomposition allows the learned policy to generalize across multiple plants with different stiffness and morphology. In experiments with multiple real-world plant setups, our system achieves up to 86.7% success in exposing target fruits, demonstrating robustness to occlusion variation and structural uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAD: Learning Advantage Distribution for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20132v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current reinforcement learning objectives for large-model reasoning primarily focus on maximizing expected rewards. This paradigm can lead to overfitting to dominant reward signals, while neglecting alternative yet valid reasoning trajectories, thereby limiting diversity and exploration. To address this issue, we introduce Learning Advantage Distributions (LAD), a distribution-matching framework that replaces advantage maximization with learning the advantage-induced distribution. By establishing the equivalence between the optimal policy update and an advantage-based target distribution, we derive a practical LAD objective formulated as minimizing an $f$-divergence between the policy-induced and advantage-induced distributions. This yields a gradient update that increases likelihood for high-advantage responses while suppressing over-confident probability growth, preventing collapse without requiring auxiliary entropy regularization. LAD incurs no extra training cost compared to GRPO and scales naturally to LLM post-training. In a controlled bandit setting, LAD faithfully recovers the multimodal advantage distribution, validating the theoretical formulation. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks across several LLM backbones show that LAD reliably improves both accuracy and generative diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReSyn: Autonomously Scaling Synthetic Environments for Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20117v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach for training reasoning language models (RLMs) by leveraging supervision from verifiers. Although verifier implementation is easier than solution annotation for many tasks, existing synthetic data generation methods remain largely solution-centric, while verifier-based methods rely on a few hand-crafted procedural environments. In this work, we scale RLVR by introducing ReSyn, a pipeline that generates diverse reasoning environments equipped with instance generators and verifiers, covering tasks such as constraint satisfaction, algorithmic puzzles, and spatial reasoning. A Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model trained with RL on ReSyn data achieves consistent gains across reasoning benchmarks and out-of-domain math benchmarks, including a 27\% relative improvement on the challenging BBEH benchmark. Ablations show that verifier-based supervision and increased task diversity both contribute significantly, providing empirical evidence that generating reasoning environments at scale can enhance reasoning abilities in RLMs</p></details> |  |
| **[AbstRaL: Augmenting LLMs' Reasoning by Reinforcing Abstract Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07751v4)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), especially smaller ones, often lack robustness in grade school math (GSM) reasoning. In particular, they tend to experience performance drops when faced with distribution shifts, such as changes to numerical or nominal variables, or insertions of distracting clauses. A possible strategy to address this involves generating synthetic data to further "instantiate" reasoning problems on potential variations. In this work, we instead focus on the strategy of "abstracting" reasoning problems. This not only helps counteract distribution shifts but also facilitates the connection to symbolic tools for deriving solutions. Focusing on GSM, we find that this abstraction process is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method, AbstRaL -- which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular abstraction data -- significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent GSM perturbation benchmarks. Besides, improving GSM robustness via AbstRaL is shown to also implicitly benefit LLMs' capabilities on OOD mathematical and general reasoning tasks, indicating that abstract thinking broadly enables better generalizability.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **[EBPO: Empirical Bayes Shrinkage for Stabilizing Group-Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05165v3)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, dominant approaches like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical stability challenges: they suffer from high estimator variance under computational constraints (small group sizes) and vanishing gradient signals in saturated failure regimes where all responses yield identical zero rewards. To address this, we propose Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO), a novel framework that regularizes local group-based baselines by borrowing strength from the policy's accumulated global statistics. Instead of estimating baselines in isolation, EBPO employs a shrinkage estimator that dynamically balances local group statistics with a global prior updated via Welford's online algorithm. Theoretically, we demonstrate that EBPO guarantees strictly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), bounded entropy decay, and non-vanishing penalty signals in failure scenarios compared to GRPO. Empirically, EBPO consistently outperforms GRPO and other established baselines across diverse benchmarks, including AIME and OlympiadBench. Notably, EBPO exhibits superior training stability, achieving high-performance gains even with small group sizes, and benefits significantly from difficulty-stratified curriculum learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Underwater Acoustic Communications with Limited Feedback: An AoI-Aware Hierarchical Bandit Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20105v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater Acoustic (UWA) networks are vital for remote sensing and ocean exploration but face inherent challenges such as limited bandwidth, long propagation delays, and highly dynamic channels. These constraints hinder real-time communication and degrade overall system performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a bilevel Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework. At the fast inner level, a Contextual Delayed MAB (CD-MAB) jointly optimizes adaptive modulation and transmission power based on both channel state feedback and its Age of Information (AoI), thereby maximizing throughput. At the slower outer level, a Feedback Scheduling MAB dynamically adjusts the channel-state feedback interval according to throughput dynamics: stable throughput allows longer update intervals, while throughput drops trigger more frequent updates. This adaptive mechanism reduces feedback overhead and enhances responsiveness to varying network conditions. The proposed bilevel framework is computationally efficient and well-suited to resource-constrained UWA networks. Simulation results using the DESERT Underwater Network Simulator demonstrate throughput gains of up to 20.61% and energy savings of up to 36.60% compared with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) baselines reported in the existing literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 9 figures, Accepted for IEEE Globecom 2025</p></details> |
| **[Shop-R1: Rewarding LLMs to Simulate Human Behavior in Online Shopping via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17842v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping environments. Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65% compared to the baseline.

| **[Descent-Guided Policy Gradient for Scalable Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20078v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally limited by cross-agent noise: when agents share a common reward, the actions of all $N$ agents jointly determine each agent's learning signal, so cross-agent noise grows with $N$. In the policy gradient setting, per-agent gradient estimate variance scales as $Θ(N)$, yielding sample complexity $\mathcal{O}(N/ε)$. We observe that many domains -- cloud computing, transportation, power systems -- have differentiable analytical models that prescribe efficient system states. In this work, we propose Descent-Guided Policy Gradient (DG-PG), a framework that constructs noise-free per-agent guidance gradients from these analytical models, decoupling each agent's gradient from the actions of all others. We prove that DG-PG reduces gradient variance from $Θ(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, preserves the equilibria of the cooperative game, and achieves agent-independent sample complexity $\mathcal{O}(1/ε)$. On a heterogeneous cloud scheduling task with up to 200 agents, DG-PG converges within 10 episodes at every tested scale -- from $N=5$ to $N=200$ -- directly confirming the predicted scale-invariant complexity, while MAPPO and IPPO fail to converge under identical architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables; plus 16 pages of appendices</p></details> |
| **[KINESIS: Motion Imitation for Human Musculoskeletal Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14637v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How do humans move? Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have produced impressive results in capturing human motion using physics-based humanoid control. However, torque-controlled humanoids fail to model key aspects of human motor control such as biomechanical joint constraints \& non-linear and overactuated musculotendon control. We present KINESIS, a model-free motion imitation framework that tackles these challenges. KINESIS is trained on 1.8 hours of locomotion data and achieves strong motion imitation performance on unseen trajectories. Through a negative mining approach, KINESIS learns robust locomotion priors that we leverage to deploy the policy on several downstream tasks such as text-to-control, target point reaching, and football penalty kicks. Importantly, KINESIS learns to generate muscle activity patterns that correlate well with human EMG activity. We show that these results scale seamlessly across biomechanical model complexity, demonstrating control of up to 290 muscles. Overall, the physiological plausibility makes KINESIS a promising model for tackling challenging problems in human motor control.

| **[MergeMix: A Unified Augmentation Paradigm for Visual and Multi-Modal Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23479v3)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL). To align multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in the post-training stage, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a stable choice but requires human annotations and lacks task generalizations, while Reinforcement Learning (RL) searches for better answers from reward signals but suffers from computational overhead and instability. To achieve balance among scalability, efficiency, and alignment generalizations, we propose MergeMix, a unified paradigm that bridges SFT and RL with an efficient Token Merge based Mixup augmentation. As for the Mixup policy, we generate contextual aligned mixed images with the corresponding labels according to the merged attention maps with cluster regions. Then, we enhance the preference-driven paradigm for MLLMs by building preference pairs with raw images and MergeMix-generated ones and optimizing the soft preference margin with the mixed SimPO loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MergeMix not only achieves dominant classification accuracy as an augmentation method but also improves generalization abilities and alignment of MLLMs, providing a new learning paradigm for preference alignment with training efficiency and stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026, Web link: https://jinxins.github.io/MergeMix_Web/</p></details> |
| **[noDice: Inference for Discrete Probabilistic Programs with Nondeterminism and Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20049v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) are an expressive and intuitive means of representing complex probability distributions. In that realm, languages like Dice target an important class of probabilistic programs: those whose probability distributions are discrete. Discrete distributions are common in many fields, including text analysis, network verification, artificial intelligence, and graph analysis. Another important feature in the world of probabilistic modeling are nondeterministic choices as found in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) which play a major role in reinforcement learning. Modern PPLs usually lack support for nondeterminism. We address this gap with the introduction of noDice, which extends the discrete probabilistic inference engine Dice. noDice performs inference on loop-free programs by constructing an MDP so that the distributions modeled by the program correspond to schedulers in the MDP. Furthermore, decision diagrams are used as an intermediate step to exploit the program structure and drastically reduce the state space of the MDP.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 7 figures, accepted to OOPSLA 2026 R1</p></details> |
| **[Analysis of approximate linear programming solution to Markov decision problem with log barrier function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19800v3)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are two primary approaches to solving Markov decision problems (MDPs): dynamic programming based on the Bellman equation and linear programming (LP). Dynamic programming methods are the most widely used and form the foundation of both classical and modern reinforcement learning (RL). By contrast, LP-based methods have been less commonly employed, although they have recently gained attention in contexts such as offline RL. The relative underuse of the LP-based methods stems from the fact that it leads to an inequality-constrained optimization problem, which is generally more challenging to solve effectively compared with Bellman-equation-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to establish a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs in a more effective and practical manner. Our key idea is to leverage the log-barrier function, widely used in inequality-constrained optimization, to transform the LP formulation of the MDP into an unconstrained optimization problem. This reformulation enables approximate solutions to be obtained easily via gradient descent. While the method may appear simple, to the best of our knowledge, a thorough theoretical interpretation of this approach has not yet been developed. This paper aims to bridge this gap.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Secure and Private Distributed Bayesian Federated Learning Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20003v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed Federated Learning (DFL) enables decentralized model training across large-scale systems without a central parameter server. However, DFL faces three critical challenges: privacy leakage from honest-but-curious neighbors, slow convergence due to the lack of central coordination, and vulnerability to Byzantine adversaries aiming to degrade model accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel DFL framework that integrates Byzantine robustness, privacy preservation, and convergence acceleration. Within this framework, each device trains a local model using a Bayesian approach and independently selects an optimal subset of neighbors for posterior exchange. We formulate this neighbor selection as an optimization problem to minimize the global loss function under security and privacy constraints. Solving this problem is challenging because devices only possess partial network information, and the complex coupling between topology, security, and convergence remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first analytically characterize the trade-offs between dynamic connectivity, Byzantine detection, privacy levels, and convergence speed. Leveraging these insights, we develop a fully distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. This approach enables devices to make autonomous connection decisions based on local observations. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves superior robustness and efficiency with significantly lower overhead compared to traditional security and privacy schemes.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

We focus on what matters most when building agents: sharp reasoning and fast, reliable execution. Step 3.5 Flash pairs a 196B-parameter foundation with 11B active parameters for efficient inference. It is optimized with interleaved 3:1 sliding-window/full attention and Multi-Token Prediction (MTP-3) to reduce the latency and cost of multi-round agentic interactions. To reach frontier-level intelligence, we design a scalable reinforcement learning framework that combines verifiable signals with preference feedback, while remaining stable under large-scale off-policy training, enabling consistent self-improvement across mathematics, code, and tool use. Step 3.5 Flash demonstrates strong performance across agent, coding, and math tasks, achieving 85.4% on IMO-AnswerBench, 86.4% on LiveCodeBench-v6 (2024.08-2025.05), 88.2% on tau2-Bench, 69.0% on BrowseComp (with context management), and 51.0% on Terminal-Bench 2.0, comparable to frontier models such as GPT-5.2 xHigh and Gemini 3.0 Pro. By redefining the efficiency frontier, Step 3.5 Flash provides a high-density foundation for deploying sophisticated agents in real-world industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report for Step 3.5 Flash</p></details> |
| **[$R^2$-Mesh: Reinforcement Learning Powered Mesh Reconstruction via Geometry and Appearance Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10135v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mesh reconstruction from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is widely used in 3D reconstruction and has been applied across numerous domains. However, existing methods typically rely solely on the given training set images, which restricts supervision to limited observations and makes it difficult to fully constrain geometry and appearance. Moreover, the contribution of each viewpoint for training is not uniform and changes dynamically during the optimization process, which can result in suboptimal guidance for both geometric refinement and rendering quality. To address these limitations, we propose $R^2$-Mesh, a reinforcement learning framework that combines NeRF-rendered pseudo-supervision with online viewpoint selection. Our key insight is to exploit NeRF's rendering ability to synthesize additional high-quality images, enriching training with diverse viewpoint information. To ensure that supervision focuses on the most beneficial perspectives, we introduce a UCB-based strategy with a geometry-aware reward, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation to identify informative viewpoints throughout training. Within this framework, we jointly optimize SDF geometry and view-dependent appearance under differentiable rendering, while periodically refining meshes to capture fine geometric details. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results in both geometric accuracy and rendering quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL-RIG: A Generative Spatial Reasoner via Intrinsic Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19974v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in image generation have achieved impressive results in producing high-quality images. However, existing image generation models still generally struggle with a spatial reasoning dilemma, lacking the ability to accurately capture fine-grained spatial relationships from the prompt and correctly generate scenes with structural integrity. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose RL-RIG, a Reinforcement Learning framework for Reflection-based Image Generation. Our architecture comprises four primary components: Diffuser, Checker, Actor, and Inverse Diffuser, following a Generate-Reflect-Edit paradigm to spark the Chain of Thought reasoning ability in image generation for addressing the dilemma. To equip the model with better intuition over generation trajectories, we further develop Reflection-GRPO to train the VLM Actor for edit prompts and the Image Editor for better image quality under a given prompt, respectively. Unlike traditional approaches that solely produce visually stunning yet structurally unreasonable content, our evaluation metrics prioritize spatial accuracy, utilizing Scene Graph IoU and employing a VLM-as-a-Judge strategy to assess the spatial consistency of generated images on LAION-SG dataset. Experimental results show that RL-RIG outperforms existing state-of-the-art open-source models by up to 11% in terms of controllable and precise spatial reasoning in image generation.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a systematic empirical study on injecting reasoning capabilities into Text-to-SQL through the lens of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We uncover a critical interplay between reward density, advantage scaling, and model capacity. Our analysis yields four primary insights. First, we propose a novel execution-guided dense reward function that significantly outperforms binary signals and existing state-of-the-art rewards by providing granular feedback at the instance level. Second, we analyze the mechanics of advantage calculation, demonstrating that while large models thrive on sparse signals with aggressive advantage scaling, smaller models require dense rewards and conservative scaling to improve Text-to-SQL performance. Third, we evaluate the impact of cold start, showing that distillation does not always improve RLVR performance and that supervised, fine-tuned models are prone to distributional mimicry. Fourth, we map the Pareto frontier of training efficiency, providing insights for optimizing Text-to-SQL reasoning under computational constraints. Our findings culminate in the Think2SQL family: our 4B-parameter model demonstrates reasoning capabilities competitive with state-of-the-art models such as o3. We release our models, datasets, and code to create a blueprint for RLVR optimization in Text-to-SQL at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Think2SQL-3B7F.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, work in progress</p></details> |
| **[Sparse Masked Attention Policies for Reliable Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19956v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reinforcement learning, abstraction methods that remove unnecessary information from the observation are commonly used to learn policies which generalize better to unseen tasks. However, these methods often overlook a crucial weakness: the function which extracts the reduced-information representation has unknown generalization ability in unseen observations. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting an information removal method which more reliably generalizes to new states. We accomplish this by using a learned masking function which operates on, and is integrated with, the attention weights within an attention-based policy network. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves policy generalization to unseen tasks in the Procgen benchmark compared to standard PPO and masking approaches.</p></details> |  |

These limitations have motivated growing interest in using textual information as the primary source of trading signals in learning-based systems. Two key challenges hinder existing approaches: (1) the absence of large-scale, event-centric datasets that jointly model news semantics and statistically grounded market reactions, and (2) the misalignment between language model reasoning and financially valid trading behavior under dynamic market conditions. To address these challenges, we propose Janus-Q, an end-to-end event-driven trading framework that elevates financial news events from auxiliary signals to primary decision units. Janus-Q unifies event-centric data construction and model optimization under a two-stage paradigm. Stage I focuses on event-centric data construction, building a large-scale financial news event dataset comprising 62,400 articles annotated with 10 fine-grained event types, associated stocks, sentiment labels, and event-driven cumulative abnormal return (CAR). Stage II performs decision-oriented fine-tuning, combining supervised learning with reinforcement learning guided by a Hierarchical Gated Reward Model (HGRM), which explicitly captures trade-offs among multiple trading objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Janus-Q achieves more consistent, interpretable, and profitable trading decisions than market indices and LLM baselines, improving the Sharpe Ratio by up to 102.0% while increasing direction accuracy by over 17.5% compared to the strongest competing strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Rank-One MIMO Q Network Framework for Accelerated Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19917v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered significant interest due to its safe and easily scalable paradigm. However, training under this paradigm presents its own challenge: the extrapolation error stemming from out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Existing methodologies have endeavored to address this issue through means like penalizing OOD Q-values or imposing similarity constraints on the learned policy and the behavior policy. Nonetheless, these approaches are often beset by limitations such as being overly conservative in utilizing OOD data, imprecise OOD data characterization, and significant computational overhead. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an Uncertainty-Aware Rank-One Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Q Network framework. The framework aims to enhance Offline Reinforcement Learning by fully leveraging the potential of OOD data while still ensuring efficiency in the learning process. Specifically, the framework quantifies data uncertainty and harnesses it in the training losses, aiming to train a policy that maximizes the lower confidence bound of the corresponding Q-function. Furthermore, a Rank-One MIMO architecture is introduced to model the uncertainty-aware Q-function, \TP{offering the same ability for uncertainty quantification as an ensemble of networks but with a cost nearly equivalent to that of a single network}. Consequently, this framework strikes a harmonious balance between precision, speed, and memory efficiency, culminating in improved overall performance. Extensive experimentation on the D4RL benchmark demonstrates that the framework attains state-of-the-art performance while remaining computationally efficient. By incorporating the concept of uncertainty quantification, our framework offers a promising avenue to alleviate extrapolation errors and enhance the efficiency of offline RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 Figures, IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[DSDR: Dual-Scale Diversity Regularization for Exploration in LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19895v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiers (RLVR) is a central paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet existing methods often suffer from limited exploration. Policies tend to collapse onto a few reasoning patterns and prematurely stop deep exploration, while conventional entropy regularization introduces only local stochasticity and fails to induce meaningful path-level diversity, leading to weak and unstable learning signals in group-based policy optimization. We propose DSDR, a Dual-Scale Diversity Regularization reinforcement learning framework that decomposes diversity in LLM reasoning into global and coupling components. Globally, DSDR promotes diversity among correct reasoning trajectories to explore distinct solution modes. Locally, it applies a length-invariant, token-level entropy regularization restricted to correct trajectories, preventing entropy collapse within each mode while preserving correctness. The two scales are coupled through a global-to-local allocation mechanism that emphasizes local regularization for more distinctive correct trajectories. We provide theoretical support showing that DSDR preserves optimal correctness under bounded regularization, sustains informative learning signals in group-based optimization, and yields a principled global-to-local coupling rule. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy and pass@k, highlighting the importance of dual-scale diversity for deep exploration in RLVR.

| **[Deep Learning: Our Miraculous Year 1990-1991](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05744v5)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Deep Learning Artificial Neural Networks (NNs) of our team have revolutionised Machine Learning & AI. Many of the basic ideas behind this revolution were published within the 12 months of our "Annus Mirabilis" 1990-1991 at our lab in TU Munich. Back then, few people were interested. But a quarter century later, NNs based on our "Miraculous Year" were on over 3 billion devices, and used many billions of times per day, consuming a significant fraction of the world's compute.

In this work, we derive mean squared error bounds for non-linear two-time-scale iterations with contractive mappings. In the setting where both stepsizes are order $Θ(1/k)$, commonly referred to as single time-scale SA with multiple coupled sequences, we obtain the first $O(1/k)$ rate without imposing additional smoothness assumptions. In the setting with true time-scale separation, the previous best bound was $O(1/k^{2/3})$. We improve this to $O(1/k^a)$ for any $a<1$ approaching the optimal $O(1/k)$ rate. The key step in our analysis involves rewriting the original iteration in terms of an averaged noise sequence whose variance decays sufficiently fast. Additionally, we use an induction-based approach to show that the iterates are bounded in expectation. Our results apply to Polyak averaging, as well as to algorithms from reinforcement learning, and optimization, including gradient descent-ascent and two-time-scale Lagrangian optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong potential in analyzing tampered images and generating interpretations. However, they still struggle with identifying micro-level artifacts, exhibit low accuracy in localizing tampered text regions, and heavily rely on expensive annotations for forgery interpretation. To this end, we introduce TextShield-R1, the first reinforcement learning based MLLM solution for tampered text detection and reasoning. Specifically, our approach introduces Forensic Continual Pre-training, an easy-to-hard curriculum that well prepares the MLLM for tampered text detection by harnessing the large-scale cheap data from natural image forensic and OCR tasks. During fine-tuning, we perform Group Relative Policy Optimization with novel reward functions to reduce annotation dependency and improve reasoning capabilities. At inference time, we enhance localization accuracy via OCR Rectification, a method that leverages the MLLM's strong text recognition abilities to refine its predictions. Furthermore, to support rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Text Forensics Reasoning (TFR) benchmark, comprising over 45k real and tampered images across 16 languages, 10 tampering techniques, and diverse domains. Rich reasoning-style annotations are included, allowing for comprehensive assessment. Our TFR benchmark simultaneously addresses seven major limitations of existing benchmarks and enables robust evaluation under cross-style, cross-method, and cross-language conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TextShield-R1 significantly advances the state of the art in interpretable tampered text detection.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

In the first part, we comprehensively examine the fundamental properties of their model-based deterministic counterparts, including projected value iteration, gradient descent algorithms, which can be viewed as prototype deterministic algorithms whose analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding and developing their model-free reinforcement learning counterparts. In particular, we prove that these algorithms converge to meaningful solutions when $n$ is sufficiently large.

A rule-driven ICoT data-synthesis pipeline jump-starts training by generating structured scene descriptions, reasoning chains and labels, cutting annotation costs. Reinforcement learning then refines the model using a composite reward balancing causal coherence with policy adherence. A multitask architecture models intra-modal manipulations (e.g., exaggerated imagery) and cross-modal mismatches (e.g., subtitle-speech drift), boosting robustness.

TO efficiently computes locally optimal solutions but can struggle with non-convexity, while RL is more robust to non-convexity at the cost of significantly higher computational demands. CACTO (Continuous Actor-Critic with Trajectory Optimization) was introduced to combine these advantages by learning a warm-start policy that guides the TO solver towards low-cost trajectories. However, scalability remains a key limitation, as increasing system complexity significantly raises the computational cost of TO. This work introduces CACTO-BIC to address these challenges. CACTO-BIC improves data efficiency by biasing initial-state sampling leveraging a property of the value function associated with locally optimal policies; moreover, it reduces computation time by exploiting GPU acceleration. Empirical evaluations show improved sample efficiency and faster computation compared to CACTO. Comparisons with PPO demonstrate that our approach can achieve similar solutions in less time. Finally, experiments on the AlienGO quadruped robot demonstrate that CACTO-BIC can scale to high-dimensional systems and is suitable for real-time applications.</p></details> |  |

However, CFR's computational complexity rises exponentially with the number of players. Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored to Spin & Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k high-stakes expert decisions; (2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100 versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI). These results suggest that LLMs could be a new way to deal with multi-player imperfect-information games like poker.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Advances in Computer Games (ACG) 2025, LNCS (Springer)</p></details> |
| **[Shuffle-R1: Efficient RL framework for Multimodal Large Language Models via Data-centric Dynamic Shuffle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05612v5)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1) Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICLR 2026 Project page at: https://xenozlh.github.io/Shuffle-R1/</p></details> |
| **[QiMeng-CodeV-R1: Reasoning-Enhanced Verilog Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24183v5)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved breakthroughs on tasks with explicit, automatable verification, such as software programming and mathematical problems. Extending RLVR to electronic design automation (EDA), especially automatically generating hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog from natural-language (NL) specifications, however, poses three key challenges: the lack of automated and accurate verification environments, the scarcity of high-quality NL-code pairs, and the prohibitive computation cost of RLVR. To this end, we introduce CodeV-R1, an RLVR framework for training Verilog generation LLMs. First, we develop a rule-based testbench generator that performs robust equivalence checking against golden references. Second, we propose a round-trip data synthesis method that pairs open-source Verilog snippets with LLM-generated NL descriptions, verifies code-NL-code consistency via the generated testbench, and filters out inequivalent examples to yield a high-quality dataset. Third, we employ a two-stage "distill-then-RL" training pipeline: distillation for the cold start of reasoning abilities, followed by adaptive DAPO, our novel RLVR algorithm that can reduce training cost by adaptively adjusting sampling rate. The resulting model, CodeV-R1-7B, achieves 68.6% and 72.9% pass@1 on VerilogEval v2 and RTLLM v1.1, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 12~20%, while even exceeding the performance of 671B DeepSeek-R1 on RTLLM. We have released our model, training code, and dataset to facilitate research in EDA and LLM communities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00502v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion alignment aims to optimize diffusion models for the downstream objective. While existing methods based on reinforcement learning or direct backpropagation achieve considerable success in maximizing rewards, they often suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse. We introduce Diffusion Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization (DAV), a framework that formulates diffusion alignment as an iterative process alternating between two complementary phases: the E-step and the M-step. In the E-step, we employ test-time search to generate diverse and reward-aligned samples. In the M-step, we refine the diffusion model using samples discovered by the E-step. We demonstrate that DAV can optimize reward while preserving diversity for both continuous and discrete tasks: text-to-image synthesis and DNA sequence design.

Central to this process is the value function, which provides learning signals to guide VLA learning from experience. In practice, the value function is estimated from trajectory fragments collected from different data sources, including historical policies and intermittent human interventions. Estimating the value function of current behavior quality from the mixture data is inherently an off-policy evaluation problem. However, prior work often adopts conservative on-policy estimation for stability, which avoids direct evaluation of the current high-capacity policy and limits learning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose ALOE, an action-level off-policy evaluation framework for VLA post-training. ALOE applies chunking-based temporal-difference bootstrapping to evaluate individual action sequences instead of predicting final task outcomes. This design improves effective credit assignment to critical action chunks under sparse rewards and supports stable policy improvement. We evaluate our method on three real-world manipulation tasks, including smartphone packing as a high-precision task, laundry folding as a long-horizon deformable-object task, and bimanual pick-and-place involving multi-object perception. Across all tasks, ALOE improves learning efficiency without compromising execution speed, showing that off-policy RL can be reintroduced in a reliable manner for real-world VLA post-training.

| **[Unifying Evolutionary Prompt Search and Reinforcement Learning for LLM Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14697v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building agentic systems that can autonomously self-improve from experience is a longstanding goal of AI. Large language models (LLMs) today primarily self-improve via two mechanisms: self-reflection for context updates, and reinforcement learning (RL) for weight updates. In this work, we propose Evolutionary System Prompt Learning (E-SPL), a method for jointly improving model contexts and model weights. In each RL iteration, E-SPL samples trajectories under multiple system prompts in parallel. It applies RL updates to LLM weights conditioned on system prompts, and evolutionary updates to system prompts via mutation and crossover, two genetic operators based on LLM self-reflection. Each system prompt is assigned a TrueSkill rating for evolutionary selection, updated from relative performance within each RL iteration. E-SPL encourages a natural division between declarative knowledge encoded in prompts and procedural knowledge encoded in weights, resulting in improved performance across reasoning and agentic tasks. For instance, in an easy-to-hard (AIME $\rightarrow$ BeyondAIME) generalization setting, E-SPL improves RL success rate from 38.8% $\rightarrow$ 45.1% while also outperforming reflective prompt evolution (40.0%). Overall, our results demonstrate that RL and evolutionary prompt search are deeply synergistic, and unifying the two yields consistent gains in sample efficiency and generalization.

| **[Advantage-based Temporal Attack in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19582v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensive research demonstrates that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models are susceptible to adversarially constructed inputs (i.e., adversarial examples), which can mislead the agent to take suboptimal or unsafe actions. Recent methods improve attack effectiveness by leveraging future rewards to guide adversarial perturbation generation over sequential time steps (i.e., reward-based attacks). However, these methods are unable to capture dependencies between different time steps in the perturbation generation process, resulting in a weak temporal correlation between the current perturbation and previous perturbations.In this paper, we propose a novel method called Advantage-based Adversarial Transformer (AAT), which can generate adversarial examples with stronger temporal correlations (i.e., time-correlated adversarial examples) to improve the attack performance. AAT employs a multi-scale causal self-attention (MSCSA) mechanism to dynamically capture dependencies between historical information from different time periods and the current state, thus enhancing the correlation between the current perturbation and the previous perturbation. Moreover, AAT introduces a weighted advantage mechanism, which quantifies the effectiveness of a perturbation in a given state and guides the generation process toward high-performance adversarial examples by sampling high-advantage regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of AAT matches or surpasses mainstream adversarial attack baselines on Atari, DeepMind Control Suite and Google football tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-lingual Collapse: How Language-Centric Foundation Models Shape Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05850v3)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) has been instrumental in eliciting strong reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs) via long chains of thought (CoT). During RLVR training, we formalize and systemically study an empirical phenomenon whereby a multilingual model's CoT reverts to its dominant pre-training language (e.g., English) even when prompted in another language, which we term Cross-lingual Collapse. Because the long-CoT regime magnifies exposure to linguistic priors, the underlying trade-off between maximizing reasoning depth and preserving target-language fidelity has remained under-characterized. To examine this trade-off, we train LLMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of math datasets widely used to elicit long-CoT reasoning. Throughout training, we track both task accuracy and the language consistency of reasoning chains. Our experiments yield three findings: (i) under RLVR, CoT in LLMs systematically drifts toward the pre-training dominant language as reasoning performance rises; (ii) English-centric priors, long-CoT GRPO optimization, task difficulty, and high-entropy decoding jointly amplify this drift, and the pattern persists beyond mathematics; and (iii) interventions that favor target-language traces--via a language-consistency reward, decoding-time controls, or more balanced backbones--mitigate collapse but reveal a persistent performance-fidelity trade-off.</p></details> | Preprint |

TRL is designed for offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) problems, where the aim is to find a policy that can reach any state from any other state in the smallest number of steps. TRL converts a triangle inequality structure present in GCRL into a practical divide-and-conquer value update rule. This has several advantages compared to alternative value learning paradigms. Compared to temporal difference (TD) methods, TRL suffers less from bias accumulation, as in principle it only requires $O(\log T)$ recursions (as opposed to $O(T)$ in TD learning) to handle a length-$T$ trajectory. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, TRL suffers less from high variance as it performs dynamic programming. Experimentally, we show that TRL achieves the best performance in highly challenging, long-horizon benchmark tasks compared to previous offline GCRL algorithms.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

Furthermore, deploying the trained policies in the real world demands a feature-rich environment along with multiple physical embodied agents, which may not be feasible due to monetary, physical, energy, or safety constraints. This work seeks to address these pain points by presenting a mixed-reality (MR) digital twin (DT) framework capable of: (i) boosting training speeds by selectively scaling parallelized simulation workloads on-demand, and (ii) immersing the MARL policies across hybrid simulation-to-reality (sim2real) experiments. The viability and performance of the proposed framework are highlighted through two representative use cases, which cover cooperative as well as competitive classes of MARL problems. We study the effect of: (i) agent and environment parallelization on training time, and (ii) systematic domain randomization on zero-shot sim2real transfer, across both case studies. Results indicate up to 76.3% reduction in training time with the proposed parallelization scheme and sim2real gap as low as 2.9% using the proposed deployment method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) and additionally accepted to be presented at IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2026</p></details> |

We introduce CoreCraft, the first environment in EnterpriseBench, Surge AI's suite of agentic RL environments. CoreCraft is a fully operational enterprise simulation of a customer support organization, comprising over 2,500 entities across 14 entity types with 23 unique tools, designed to measure whether AI agents can perform the multi-step, domain-specific work that real jobs demand. Frontier models such as GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6 solve fewer than 30% of tasks when all expert-authored rubric criteria must be satisfied. Using this environment, we train GLM 4.6 with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and adaptive clipping. After a single epoch of training, the model improves from 25.37% to 36.76% task pass rate on held-out evaluation tasks. More importantly, these gains transfer to out-of-distribution benchmarks: +4.5% on BFCL Parallel, +7.4% on Tau2-Bench Retail, and +6.8% on Tool Decathlon (Pass@1). We believe three environment properties are consistent with the observed transfer: task-centric world building that optimizes for diverse, challenging tasks; expert-authored rubrics enabling reliable reward computation; and enterprise workflows that reflect realistic professional patterns. Our results suggest that environment quality, diversity, and realism are key factors enabling generalizable agent capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved breakthroughs in image-text understanding and semantic reasoning, suggesting that integrating visual and linguistic co-inference into FAS can substantially improve both robustness and interpretability. However, the lack of a high-quality vision-language multimodal dataset has been a critical bottleneck. To address this, we introduce FaceCoT (Face Chain-of-Thought), the first large-scale Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset tailored for FAS. FaceCoT covers 14 spoofing attack types and enriches model learning with high-quality CoT VQA annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a caption model refined via reinforcement learning to expand the dataset and enhance annotation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a CoT-Enhanced Progressive Learning (CEPL) strategy to better leverage the CoT data and boost model performance on FAS tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained with FaceCoT and CEPL outperform state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2026 |
| **[STAPO: Stabilizing Reinforcement Learning for LLMs by Silencing Rare Spurious Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15620v3)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has significantly improved large language model reasoning, but existing RL fine-tuning methods rely heavily on heuristic techniques such as entropy regularization and reweighting to maintain stability. In practice, they often suffer from late-stage performance collapse, leading to degraded reasoning quality and unstable training. Our analysis shows that the magnitude of token-wise policy gradients in RL is negatively correlated with token probability and local policy entropy. We find that training instability can be caused by a tiny fraction of tokens, approximately 0.01%, which we term spurious tokens. When such tokens appear in correct responses, they contribute little to the reasoning outcome but inherit the full sequence-level reward, leading to abnormally amplified gradient updates. To mitigate this instability, we design an S2T (silencing spurious tokens) mechanism to efficiently identify spurious tokens through characteristic signals with low probability, low entropy, and positive advantage, and then suppress their gradient perturbations during optimization. Incorporating this mechanism into a group-based objective, we propose Spurious-Token-Aware Policy Optimization (STAPO), which promotes stable and effective large-scale model refinement. Across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks using Qwen 1.7B, 8B, and 14B base models, STAPO consistently demonstrates superior entropy stability and achieves an average performance improvement of 7.13% ($ρ_{\mathrm{T}}$=1.0, top-p=1.0) and 3.69% ($ρ_{\mathrm{T}}$=0.7, top-p=0.9) over GRPO, 20-Entropy, and JustRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cost-Aware Diffusion Active Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19538v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active search for recovering objects of interest through online, adaptive decision making with autonomous agents requires trading off exploration of unknown environments with exploitation of prior observations in the search space. Prior work has proposed information gain and Thompson sampling based myopic, greedy approaches for agents to actively decide query or search locations when the number of targets is unknown. Decision making algorithms in such partially observable environments have also shown that agents capable of lookahead over a finite horizon outperform myopic policies for active search. Unfortunately, lookahead algorithms typically rely on building a computationally expensive search tree that is simulated and updated based on the agent's observations and a model of the environment dynamics. Instead, in this work, we leverage the sequence modeling abilities of diffusion models to sample lookahead action sequences that balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off for active search without building an exhaustive search tree. We identify the optimism bias in prior diffusion based reinforcement learning approaches when applied to the active search setting and propose mitigating solutions for efficient cost-aware decision making with both single and multi-agent teams. Our proposed algorithm outperforms standard baselines in offline reinforcement learning in terms of full recovery rate and is computationally more efficient than tree search in cost-aware active decision making.</p></details> | In submission |

Prompt, Reward, and Policy Optimization in Search-R1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19526v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Research agents tackle knowledge-intensive tasks through multi-round retrieval and decision-oriented generation. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to improve performance in this paradigm, its contributions remain underexplored. To fully understand the role of RL, we conduct a systematic study along three decoupled dimensions: prompt template, reward function, and policy optimization. Our study reveals that: 1) the Fast Thinking template yields greater stability and better performance than the Slow Thinking template used in prior work; 2) the F1-based reward underperforms the EM due to training collapse driven by answer avoidance; this can be mitigated by incorporating action-level penalties, ultimately surpassing EM; 3) REINFORCE outperforms PPO while requiring fewer search actions, whereas GRPO shows the poorest stability among policy optimization methods. Building on these insights, we then introduce Search-R1++, a strong baseline that improves the performance of Search-R1 from 0.403 to 0.442 (Qwen2.5-7B) and 0.289 to 0.331 (Qwen2.5-3B). We hope that our findings can pave the way for more principled and reliable RL training strategies in Deep Research systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Your Reasoning Model Implicitly Know When to Stop Thinking?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08354v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have greatly improved their capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chains of Thought (CoTs). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy, impairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time applications. Recent studies show that longer reasoning chains are frequently uncorrelated with correctness and can even be detrimental to accuracy. In a further in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, we surprisingly uncover and empirically verify that LRMs implicitly know the appropriate time to stop thinking, while this capability is obscured by current sampling paradigms. Motivated by this, we introduce SAGE (Self-Aware Guided Efficient Reasoning), a novel sampling paradigm that unleashes this efficient reasoning potential. Furthermore, integrating SAGE as mixed sampling into group-based reinforcement learning (SAGE-RL) enables SAGE-RL to effectively incorporate SAGE-discovered efficient reasoning patterns into standard pass@1 inference, markedly enhancing both the reasoning accuracy and efficiency of LRMs across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, jointly optimizing multiple rewards often incurs an alignment tax, improving one dimension while degrading others. To address this, we introduce two complementary methods: MapReduce LoRA and Reward-aware Token Embedding (RaTE). MapReduce LoRA trains preference-specific LoRA experts in parallel and iteratively merges them to refine a shared base model; RaTE learns reward-specific token embeddings that compose at inference for flexible preference control. Experiments on Text-to-Image generation (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX.1-dev) show improvements of 36.1%, 4.6%, and 55.7%, and 32.7%, 4.3%, and 67.1% on GenEval, PickScore, and OCR, respectively. On Text-to-Video generation (HunyuanVideo), visual and motion quality improve by 48.1% and 90.0%, respectively. On the language task, Helpful Assistant, with Llama-2 7B, helpful and harmless improve by 43.4% and 136.7%, respectively. Our framework sets a new state-of-the-art multi-preference alignment recipe across modalities.</p></details> | CVPR 2026 |
| **[Task-Oriented Computation Offloading for Edge Inference: An Integrated Bayesian Optimization and Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21090v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge intelligence (EI) allows resource-constrained edge devices (EDs) to offload computation-intensive AI tasks (e.g., visual object detection) to edge servers (ESs) for fast execution. However, transmitting high-volume raw task data (e.g., 4K video) over bandwidth-limited wireless networks incurs significant latency. While EDs can reduce transmission latency by degrading data before transmission (e.g., reducing resolution from 4K to 720p or 480p), it often deteriorates inference accuracy, creating a critical accuracy-latency tradeoff. The difficulty in balancing this tradeoff stems from the absence of closed-form models capturing content-dependent accuracy-latency relationships. Besides, under bandwidth sharing constraints, the discrete degradation decisions among the EDs demonstrate inherent combinatorial complexity. Mathematically, it requires solving a challenging \textit{black-box} mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). To address this problem, we propose LAB, a novel learning framework that seamlessly integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and Bayesian optimization (BO). Specifically, LAB employs: (a) a DNN-based actor that maps input system state to degradation actions, directly addressing the combinatorial complexity of the MINLP; and (b) a BO-based critic with an explicit model built from fitting a Gaussian process surrogate with historical observations, enabling model-based evaluation of degradation actions. For each selected action, optimal bandwidth allocation is then efficiently derived via convex optimization. Numerical evaluations on real-world self-driving datasets demonstrate that LAB achieves near-optimal accuracy-latency tradeoff, exhibiting only 1.22\% accuracy degradation and 0.07s added latency compared to exhaustive search...

| **[Scalable Multi-Objective and Meta Reinforcement Learning via Gradient Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12779v3)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of efficiently estimating policies that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). Given $n$ objectives (or tasks), we seek the optimal partition of these objectives into $k \ll n$ groups, where each group comprises related objectives that can be trained together. This problem arises in applications such as robotics, control, and preference optimization in language models, where learning a single policy for all $n$ objectives is suboptimal as $n$ grows. We introduce a two-stage procedure -- meta-training followed by fine-tuning -- to address this problem. We first learn a meta-policy for all objectives using multitask learning. Then, we adapt the meta-policy to multiple randomly sampled subsets of objectives. The adaptation step leverages a first-order approximation property of well-trained policy networks, which is empirically verified to be accurate within a 2% error margin across various RL environments. The resulting algorithm, PolicyGradEx, efficiently estimates an aggregate task-affinity score matrix given a policy evaluation algorithm. Based on the estimated affinity score matrix, we cluster the $n$ objectives into $k$ groups by maximizing the intra-cluster affinity scores. Experiments on three robotic control and the Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16% on average, while delivering up to $26\times$ faster speedup relative to performing full training to obtain the clusters. Ablation studies validate each component of our approach. For instance, compared with random grouping and gradient-similarity-based grouping, our loss-based clustering yields an improvement of 19%. Finally, we analyze the generalization error of policy networks by measuring the Hessian trace of the loss surface, which gives non-vacuous measures relative to the observed generalization errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages.

Conversely, fine-tuned time-series LLMs (TSLMs) understand these patterns but lack the capacity to generalize reasoning for more complicated questions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge-injection framework that injects TSLM-generated insights directly into GRLM's reasoning trace, thereby achieving strong time-series reasoning with in-domain knowledge. As collecting data for knowledge injection fine-tuning is costly, we further leverage a reinforcement learning-based approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfer such an in-domain thinking trace into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection. We further release SenTSR-Bench, a multivariate time-series-based diagnostic reasoning benchmark collected from real-world industrial operations. Across SenTSR-Bench and other public datasets, our method consistently surpasses TSLMs by 9.1%-26.1% and GRLMs by 7.9%-22.4%, delivering robust, context-aware time-series diagnostic insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 29th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2026)</p></details> |

We show that for subjective perception tasks, this alignment can be achieved without any model training: VLMs are already strong concept extractors but poor decision calibrators, and the gap can be closed externally. We propose a training-free post-hoc concept-bottleneck pipeline consisting of three tightly coupled stages: concept mining, multi-agent structured scoring, and geometric calibration, unified by an end-to-end dimension optimization loop. Interpretable evaluation dimensions are mined from a handful of human annotations; an Observer-Debater-Judge chain extracts robust continuous concept scores from a frozen VLM; and locally-weighted ridge regression on a hybrid visual-semantic manifold calibrates these scores against human ratings. Applied to urban perception as UrbanAlign, the framework achieves 72.2% accuracy ($κ=0.45$) on Place Pulse 2.0 across six categories, outperforming the best supervised baseline by +15.1 pp and uncalibrated VLM scoring by +16.3 pp, with full dimension-level interpretability and zero model-weight modification.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Liquidity Providers (LPs) face a non-trivial trade-off between maximizing fee accrual through tight price-range concentration and minimizing the friction costs of rebalancing, including gas fees and swap slippage. Existing methods typically employ heuristic or threshold strategies that fail to account for market dynamics. This paper formulates liquidity management as an optimal control problem and derives the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality (HJB-QVI). We present an approximate solution RAmmStein, a Deep Reinforcement Learning method that incorporates the mean-reversion speed (theta) of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process among other features as input to the model. We demonstrate that the agent learns to separate the state space into regions of action and inaction. We evaluate the framework using high-frequency 1Hz Coinbase trade data comprising over 6.8M trades. Experimental results show that RAmmStein achieves a superior net ROI of 0.72% compared to both passive and aggressive strategies. Notably, the agent reduces rebalancing frequency by 67% compared to a greedy rebalancing strategy while maintaining 88% active time. Our results demonstrate that regime-aware laziness can significantly improve capital efficiency by preserving the returns that would otherwise be eroded by the operational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables, 1 algorithm; submitted to Designing DeFi workshop (https://www.designingdefi.xyz/)</p></details> |
| **[IR$^3$: Contrastive Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Interpretable Detection and Mitigation of Reward Hacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19416v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) enables powerful LLM alignment but can introduce reward hacking - models exploit spurious correlations in proxy rewards without genuine alignment. Compounding this, the objectives internalized during RLHF remain opaque, making hacking behaviors difficult to detect or correct. We introduce IR3 (Interpretable Reward Reconstruction and Rectification), a framework that reverse-engineers, interprets, and surgically repairs the implicit objectives driving RLHF-tuned models. We propose Contrastive Inverse Reinforcement Learning (C-IRL), which reconstructs the implicit reward function by contrasting paired responses from post-alignment and baseline policies to explain behavioral shifts during RLHF. We then decompose the reconstructed reward via sparse autoencoders into interpretable features, enabling identification of hacking signatures through contribution analysis. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies - clean reward optimization, adversarial shaping, constrained optimization, and feature-guided distillation - that target problematic features while preserving beneficial alignment. Experiments across multiple reward model configurations show that IR3 achieves 0.89 correlation with ground-truth rewards, identifies hacking features with over 90% precision, and significantly reduces hacking behaviors while maintaining capabilities within 3% of the original model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polychromic Objectives for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25424v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies, trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective. Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2) modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations. Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.</p></details> |  |

We augment DQN and PPO with Hilbert-based spatial indices to structure exploration and reduce redundancy in sparse-reward environments, and we evaluate scalability in multi-robot grid coverage. We further describe a waypoint interface that converts Hilbert orderings into curvature-bounded, time-parameterized SE(2) trajectories (planar (x, y, θ)), enabling onboard feasibility on resource-constrained robots. Experiments show improvements in coverage efficiency, redundancy, and convergence speed over DQN/PPO baselines. In addition, we validate the approach on a Boston Dynamics Spot legged robot, executing the generated trajectories in indoor environments and observing reliable coverage with low redundancy. These results indicate that geometric priors improve autonomy and scalability for swarm and legged robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Information-Optimized Multi-Agent Path Finding: A Hybrid Framework with Reduced Inter-Agent Information Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09469v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) remains a critical problem in robotics and autonomous systems, where agents must navigate shared spaces efficiently while avoiding conflicts. Traditional centralized algorithms with global information provide high-quality solutions but scale poorly in large-scale scenarios due to the combinatorial explosion of conflicts. Conversely, distributed approaches that have local information, particularly learning-based methods, offer better scalability by operating with relaxed information availability, yet often at the cost of solution quality. In realistic deployments, information is a constrained resource: broadcasting full agent states and goals can raise privacy concerns, strain limited bandwidth, and require extra sensing and communication hardware, increasing cost and energy use. We focus on the core question of how MAPF can be solved with minimal inter-agent information sharing while preserving solution feasibility. To this end, we present an information-centric formulation of the MAPF problem and introduce a hybrid framework, IO-MAPF, that integrates decentralized path planning with a lightweight centralized coordinator. In this framework, agents use reinforcement learning (RL) to plan independently, while the central coordinator provides minimal, targeted signals, such as static conflict-cell indicators or short conflict trajectories, that are dynamically shared to support efficient conflict resolution. We introduce an Information Units (IU) metric to quantify information use and show that our alert-driven design achieves 2x to 23x reduction in information sharing, compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, while maintaining high success rates, demonstrating that reliable MAPF is achievable under strongly information-restricted, privacy-preserving conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm using simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrapping Task Spaces for Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04575v3)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Progress in many task domains emerges from repeated revisions to previous solution attempts. Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such sequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning (RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can be both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family of autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of self-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at inference-time while only training on the most informative single-step iterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most informative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for continued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task instances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with explicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across several domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and machine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting from either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the ability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.</p></details> | TMLR, February 2026 |
| **[Stable Deep Reinforcement Learning via Isotropic Gaussian Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19373v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning systems often suffer from unstable training dynamics due to non-stationarity, where learning objectives and data distributions evolve over time. We show that under non-stationary targets, isotropic Gaussian embeddings are provably advantageous. In particular, they induce stable tracking of time-varying targets for linear readouts, achieve maximal entropy under a fixed variance budget, and encourage a balanced use of all representational dimensions--all of which enable agents to be more adaptive and stable. Building on this insight, we propose the use of Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization for shaping representations toward an isotropic Gaussian distribution during training. We demonstrate empirically, over a variety of domains, that this simple and computationally inexpensive method improves performance under non-stationarity while reducing representation collapse, neuron dormancy, and training instability.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs Can Learn to Reason Via Off-Policy RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19362v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently use on-policy algorithms, such as PPO or GRPO. However, policy lag from distributed training architectures and differences between the training and inference policies break this assumption, making the data off-policy by design. To rectify this, prior work has focused on making this off-policy data appear more on-policy, either via importance sampling (IS), or by more closely aligning the training and inference policies by explicitly modifying the inference engine. In this work, we embrace off-policyness and propose a novel off-policy RL algorithm that does not require these modifications: Optimal Advantage-based Policy Optimization with Lagged Inference policy (OAPL). We show that OAPL outperforms GRPO with importance sampling on competition math benchmarks, and can match the performance of a publicly available coding model, DeepCoder, on LiveCodeBench, while using 3x fewer generations during training. We further empirically demonstrate that models trained via OAPL have improved test time scaling under the Pass@k metric. OAPL allows for efficient, effective post-training even with lags of more than 400 gradient steps between the training and inference policies, 100x more off-policy than prior approaches.</p></details> |  |

Using the open source AeroBench F-16 simulation benchmark, we train a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent to regulate engine throttle and track commanded airspeed. The control objective is encoded as a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) requirement to maintain airspeed within a prescribed band during the final seconds of each maneuver. To enforce this specification at run time, we introduce a conformal STL shield that filters the RL agent's actions using online conformal prediction. We compare three settings: (i) PPO baseline, (ii) PPO with a classical rule-based STL shield, and (iii) PPO with the proposed conformal shield, under both nominal conditions and a severe stress scenario involving aerodynamic model mismatch, actuator rate limits, measurement noise, and mid-episode setpoint jumps. Experiments show that the conformal shield preserves STL satisfaction while maintaining near baseline performance and providing stronger robustness guarantees than the classical shield. These results demonstrate that combining formal specification monitoring with data driven RL control can substantially improve the reliability of autonomous flight control in challenging environments.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

We introduce a two-stage gradient-based framework that provides interpretable diagnostics for three critical failure analysis tasks: (1) detecting the true initial failure source (Patient-0); (2) validating why non-attacked agents may be flagged first due to domino effects; and (3) tracing how failures propagate through learned coordination pathways. Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing. Stage 2 provides validation through geometric analysis of critic derivatives-first-order sensitivity and directional second-order curvature aggregated over causal windows to construct interpretable contagion graphs. This approach explains "downstream-first" detection anomalies by revealing pathways that amplify upstream deviations. Evaluated across 500 episodes in Simple Spread (3 and 5 agents) and 100 episodes in StarCraft II using MADDPG and HATRPO, our method achieves 88.2-99.4% Patient-0 detection accuracy while providing interpretable geometric evidence for detection decisions. By moving beyond black-box detection to interpretable gradient-level forensics, this framework offers practical tools for diagnosing cascading failures in safety-critical MARL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 25th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Reasoning for Diffusion LLMs via Distribution Matching Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08233v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are promising alternatives to autoregressive large language models (AR-LLMs), as they potentially allow higher inference throughput. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial component for dLLMs to achieve comparable performance with AR-LLMs on important tasks, such as reasoning. However, RL algorithms that are well-suited for dLLMs' unique characteristics have yet to be developed. This paper proposes Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO), a principled and theoretically grounded RL fine-tuning method specifically designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of dLLMs by matching the dLLM policy distribution to the optimal, reward-tilted one through cross-entropy optimization. We identify a key challenge in the implementation with a small training batch size and propose several effective solutions through a novel weight baseline subtraction technique. DMPO exhibits superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks without supervised fine-tuning, with an accuracy improvement of up to $54.3\%$ over previously SOTA baselines and $66.41\%$ over the base model, underscoring the effectiveness of the distribution matching framework.

Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have been proposed for AFA, ranging from myopic information-theoretic strategies to non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of these methods has been hindered by a lack of standardized benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, myopic, and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, CUBE-NM, designed to expose the limitations of myopic selection. Our results highlight key trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for future research.

| **[Soft Sequence Policy Optimization: Bridging GMPO and SAPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19327v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant portion of recent research on Large Language Model (LLM) alignment focuses on developing new policy optimization methods based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Two prominent directions have emerged: (i) a shift toward sequence-level importance sampling weights that better align with the sequence-level rewards used in many tasks, and (ii) alternatives to PPO-style clipping that aim to avoid the associated loss of training signal and entropy collapse. Recent work, such as Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), reformulates the Scopic objective within the GRPO framework and achieves both sequence coherence and token adaptivity. Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO) leverages token-wise ratio clipping within sequence importance sampling weights. Building on these ideas, this work proposes a new objective that promotes effective policy exploration while maintaining training stability. Specifically, we introduce Soft Sequence Policy Optimization, an off-policy reinforcement learning objective that incorporates soft gating functions over token-level probability ratios within sequence-level importance weights.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art methods primarily rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) solutions that construct personal context by retrieving relevant items from the user's profile. Existing methods use the user's query directly to retrieve personal documents, and such strategies often lead to surface-level personalization. We propose PR2 (Personalized Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning), a reinforcement learning framework that integrates reasoning and retrieval from personal context for personalization. PR2 learns adaptive retrieval-reasoning policies, determining when to retrieve, what evidence to retrieve from user profiles, and how to incorporate it into intermediate reasoning steps. By optimizing multi-turn reasoning trajectories under a personalized reward function, the framework reinforces reasoning paths that better align with user-specific preferences and contextual signals reflected by the reward model. Extensive experiments on the LaMP-QA benchmark using three LLMs show that PR2 consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 8.8%-12% in personalized QA.</p></details> |  |
| **[TOPReward: Token Probabilities as Hidden Zero-Shot Rewards for Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19313v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have seen rapid progress in pretraining, their advancement in Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains hampered by low sample efficiency and sparse rewards in real-world settings. Developing generalizable process reward models is essential for providing the fine-grained feedback necessary to bridge this gap, yet existing temporal value functions often fail to generalize beyond their training domains. We introduce TOPReward, a novel, probabilistically grounded temporal value function that leverages the latent world knowledge of pretrained video Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to estimate robotic task progress. Unlike prior methods that prompt VLMs to directly output progress values, which are prone to numerical misrepresentation, TOPReward extracts task progress directly from the VLM's internal token logits. In zero-shot evaluations across 130+ distinct real-world tasks and multiple robot platforms (e.g., Franka, YAM, SO-100/101), TOPReward achieves 0.947 mean Value-Order Correlation (VOC) on Qwen3-VL, dramatically outperforming the state-of-the-art GVL baseline which achieves near-zero correlation on the same open-source model. We further demonstrate that TOPReward serves as a versatile tool for downstream applications, including success detection and reward-aligned behavior cloning.</p></details> |  |

To address these constraints, we present the Alzheimer's Learning Platform for Adaptive Care Agents (ALPACA), an open-source, Gym-compatible reinforcement learning (RL) environment for systematically exploring personalized treatment strategies using existing therapies. ALPACA is powered by the Continuous Action-conditioned State Transitions (CAST) model trained on longitudinal trajectories from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), enabling medication-conditioned simulation of disease progression under alternative treatment decisions. We show that CAST autoregressively generates realistic medication-conditioned trajectories and that RL policies trained in ALPACA outperform no-treatment and behavior-cloned clinician baselines on memory-related outcomes. Interpretability analyses further indicated that the learned policies relied on clinically meaningful patient features when selecting actions. Overall, ALPACA provides a reusable in silico testbed for studying individualized sequential treatment decision-making for AD.</p></details> |  |

Graph diffusion models have similarly been applied to combinatorial structure generation, including neural architecture search (NAS). However, neural architectures are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where edge direction encodes functional semantics such as data flow-information that existing graph diffusion methods, designed for undirected structures, discard. We propose Directed Graph Policy Optimization (DGPO), which extends reinforcement learning fine-tuning of discrete graph diffusion models to DAGs via topological node ordering and positional encoding. Validated on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201, DGPO matches the benchmark optimum on all three NAS-Bench-201 tasks (91.61%, 73.49%, 46.77%). The central finding is that the model learns transferable structural priors: pretrained on only 7% of the search space, it generates near-oracle architectures after fine-tuning, within 0.32 percentage points of the full-data model and extrapolating 7.3 percentage points beyond its training ceiling. Bidirectional control experiments confirm genuine reward-driven steering, with inverse optimization reaching near random-chance accuracy (9.5%). These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning-steered discrete diffusion, once extended to handle directionality, provides a controllable generative framework for directed combinatorial structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IJCNN 2026 (IEEE WCCI). 6 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[OffSeeker: Online Reinforcement Learning Is Not All You Need for Deep Research Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18467v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep research agents have shown remarkable potential in handling long-horizon tasks. However, state-of-the-art performance typically relies on online reinforcement learning (RL), which is financially expensive due to extensive API calls. While offline training offers a more efficient alternative, its progress is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality research trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate that expensive online reinforcement learning is not all you need to build powerful research agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fully open-source suite designed for effective offline training. Our core contributions include DeepForge, a ready-to-use task synthesis framework that generates large-scale research queries without heavy preprocessing; and a curated collection of 66k QA pairs, 33k SFT trajectories, and 21k DPO pairs. Leveraging these resources, we train OffSeeker (8B), a model developed entirely offline. Extensive evaluations across six benchmarks show that OffSeeker not only leads among similar-sized agents but also remains competitive with 30B-parameter systems trained via heavy online RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Exploration in Directed Controller Synthesis via Reinforcement Learning with Soft Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19244v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On-the-fly Directed Controller Synthesis (OTF-DCS) mitigates state-space explosion by incrementally exploring the system and relies critically on an exploration policy to guide search efficiently. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches learn such policies and achieve promising zero-shot generalization from small training instances to larger unseen ones. However, a fundamental limitation is anisotropic generalization, where an RL policy exhibits strong performance only in a specific region of the domain-parameter space while remaining fragile elsewhere due to training stochasticity and trajectory-dependent bias. To address this, we propose a Soft Mixture-of-Experts framework that combines multiple RL experts via a prior-confidence gating mechanism and treats these anisotropic behaviors as complementary specializations. The evaluation on the Air Traffic benchmark shows that Soft-MoE substantially expands the solvable parameter space and improves robustness compared to any single expert.</p></details> |  |

GraphOmni encompasses diverse graph types, serialization formats, and prompting schemes, significantly exceeding prior efforts in both scope and depth. Through extensive systematic evaluation, we identify critical interactions among these dimensions, demonstrating their substantial impact on model performance. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art models like Claude-3.5 and o4-mini consistently outperform other models, yet even these leading models exhibit substantial room for improvement. Performance variability is evident depending on the specific combinations of factors we considered, underscoring the necessity of comprehensive evaluations across these interconnected dimensions. Additionally, we observe distinct impacts of serialization and prompting strategies between open-source and closed-source models, encouraging the development of tailored approaches. Motivated by the findings, we also propose a reinforcement learning-inspired framework that adaptively selects the optimal factors influencing LLM reasoning capabilities. This flexible and extendable benchmark not only deepens our understanding of LLM performance on structured tasks but also provides a robust foundation for advancing research in LLM-based graph reasoning.

| **[Characterizing MARL for Energy Control: A Multi-KPI Benchmark on the CityLearn Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19223v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimization of urban energy systems is crucial for the advancement of sustainable and resilient smart cities, which are becoming increasingly complex with multiple decision-making units. To address scalability and coordination concerns, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a promising solution. This paper addresses the imperative need for comprehensive and reliable benchmarking of MARL algorithms on energy management tasks. CityLearn is used as a case study environment because it realistically simulates urban energy systems, incorporates multiple storage systems, and utilizes renewable energy sources. By doing so, our work sets a new standard for evaluation, conducting a comparative study across multiple key performance indicators (KPIs). This approach illuminates the key strengths and weaknesses of various algorithms, moving beyond traditional KPI averaging which often masks critical insights. Our experiments utilize widely accepted baselines such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC), and encompass diverse training schemes including Decentralized Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) and Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) approaches and different neural network architectures. Our work also proposes novel KPIs that tackle real world implementation challenges such as individual building contribution and battery storage lifetime. Our findings show that DTDE consistently outperforms CTDE in both average and worst-case performance. Additionally, temporal dependency learning improved control on memory dependent KPIs such as ramping and battery usage, contributing to more sustainable battery operation. Results also reveal robustness to agent or resource removal, highlighting both the resilience and decentralizability of the learned policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Allocate, How to Learn? Dynamic Rollout Allocation and Advantage Modulation for Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19208v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, yet current methods face key challenges in resource allocation and policy optimization dynamics: (i) uniform rollout allocation ignores gradient variance heterogeneity across problems, and (ii) the softmax policy structure causes gradient attenuation for high-confidence correct actions, while excessive gradient updates may destabilize training. Therefore, we propose DynaMO, a theoretically-grounded dual-pronged optimization framework. At the sequence level, we prove that uniform allocation is suboptimal and derive variance-minimizing allocation from the first principle, establishing Bernoulli variance as a computable proxy for gradient informativeness. At the token level, we develop gradient-aware advantage modulation grounded in theoretical analysis of gradient magnitude bounds. Our framework compensates for gradient attenuation of high-confidence correct actions while utilizing entropy changes as computable indicators to stabilize excessive update magnitudes. Extensive experiments conducted on a diverse range of mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong RLVR baselines. Our implementation is available at: \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/dynamo-680E/README.md}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/dynamo}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Problem Generation via Symbolic Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19187v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method for generating training data for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to improve small open-weights language models on mathematical tasks. Existing data generation approaches rely on open-loop pipelines and fixed modifications that do not adapt to the model's capabilities. Furthermore, they typically operate directly on word problems, limiting control over problem structure. To address this, we perform modifications in a symbolic problem space, representing each problem as a set of symbolic variables and constraints (e.g., via algebraic frameworks such as SymPy or SMT formulations). This representation enables precise control over problem structure, automatic generation of ground-truth solutions, and decouples mathematical reasoning from linguistic realization. We also show that this results in more diverse generations. To adapt the problem difficulty to the model, we introduce a closed-loop framework that learns modification strategies through prompt optimization in symbolic space. Experimental results demonstrate that both adaptive problem generation and symbolic representation modifications contribute to improving the model's math solving ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-to-Robot Interaction: Learning from Video Demonstration for Robot Imitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19184v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from Demonstration (LfD) offers a promising paradigm for robot skill acquisition. Recent approaches attempt to extract manipulation commands directly from video demonstrations, yet face two critical challenges: (1) general video captioning models prioritize global scene features over task-relevant objects, producing descriptions unsuitable for precise robotic execution, and (2) end-to-end architectures coupling visual understanding with policy learning require extensive paired datasets and struggle to generalize across objects and scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel ``Human-to-Robot'' imitation learning pipeline that enables robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from unstructured video demonstrations, inspired by the human ability to learn by watching and imitating. Our key innovation is a modular framework that decouples the learning process into two distinct stages: (1) Video Understanding, which combines Temporal Shift Modules (TSM) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract actions and identify interacted objects, and (2) Robot Imitation, which employs TD3-based deep reinforcement learning to execute the demonstrated manipulations. We validated our approach in PyBullet simulation environments with a UR5e manipulator and in a real-world experiment with a UF850 manipulator across four fundamental actions: reach, pick, move, and put. For video understanding, our method achieves 89.97% action classification accuracy and BLEU-4 scores of 0.351 on standard objects and 0.265 on novel objects, representing improvements of 76.4% and 128.4% over the best baseline, respectively. For robot manipulation, our framework achieves an average success rate of 87.5% across all actions, with 100% success on reaching tasks and up to 90% on complex pick-and-place operations.

| **[Generative Reasoning Re-ranker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07774v4)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies increasingly explore Large Language Models (LLMs) as a new paradigm for recommendation systems due to their scalability and world knowledge. However, existing work has three key limitations: (1) most efforts focus on retrieval and ranking, while the reranking phase, critical for refining final recommendations, is largely overlooked; (2) LLMs are typically used in zero-shot or supervised fine-tuning settings, leaving their reasoning abilities, especially those enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL) and high-quality reasoning data, underexploited; (3) items are commonly represented by non-semantic IDs, creating major scalability challenges in industrial systems with billions of identifiers. To address these gaps, we propose the Generative Reasoning Reranker (GR2), an end-to-end framework with a three-stage training pipeline tailored for reranking. First, a pretrained LLM is mid-trained on semantic IDs encoded from non-semantic IDs via a tokenizer achieving $\ge$99% uniqueness. Next, a stronger larger-scale LLM generates high-quality reasoning traces through carefully designed prompting and rejection sampling, which are used for supervised fine-tuning to impart foundational reasoning skills. Finally, we apply Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO), enabling scalable RL supervision with verifiable rewards designed specifically for reranking. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate GR2's effectiveness: it surpasses the state-of-the-art OneRec-Think by 2.4% in Recall@5 and 1.3% in NDCG@5. Ablations confirm that advanced reasoning traces yield substantial gains across metrics. We further find that RL reward design is crucial in reranking: LLMs tend to exploit reward hacking by preserving item order, motivating conditional verifiable rewards to mitigate this behavior and optimize reranking performance.</p></details> | 31 pages |

While artificial curiosity offers a powerful self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked, resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in sparse-reward environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToolSelf: Unifying Task Execution and Self-Reconfiguration via Tool-Driven Intrinsic Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07883v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in tackling complex, long-horizon tasks. However, their efficacy is fundamentally constrained by static configurations governing agent behaviors, which are fixed prior to execution and fail to adapt to evolving task dynamics. Existing approaches, relying on manual orchestration or heuristic-based patches, often struggle with poor generalization and fragmented optimization. To transcend these limitations, we propose ToolSelf, a novel paradigm enabling tool-driven runtime self-reconfiguration. By abstracting configuration updates as a callable tool, ToolSelf unifies task execution and self-adjustment into a single action space, achieving a phase transition from external rules to intrinsic parameters. Agents can thereby autonomously update their sub-goals and context based on task progression, and correspondingly adapt their strategy and toolbox, transforming from passive executors into dual managers of both task and self. We further devise Configuration-Aware Two-stage Training (CAT), combining rejection sampling fine-tuning with trajectory-level reinforcement learning to internalize this meta-capability. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ToolSelf rivals specialized workflows while generalizing to novel tasks, achieving a 24.1% average performance gain and illuminating a path toward truly self-adaptive agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Predictability of Reinforcement Learning Dynamics for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00553v3)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1 Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window, achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 28 figures;</p></details> |

Generative AI has been explored to warm-start ILT, yet most approaches train deterministic image-to-image translators to mimic sub-optimal datasets, providing limited guidance for escaping non-convex traps during refinement. We reformulate mask synthesis as conditional sampling: a generator learns a distribution over masks conditioned on the design and proposes multiple candidates. The generator is first pretrained with WGAN plus a reconstruction loss, then fine-tuned using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an ILT-guided imitation loss. At inference, we sample a small batch of masks, run fast batched ILT refinement, evaluate lithography metrics (e.g., EPE, process window), and select the best candidate. On \texttt{LithoBench} dataset, the proposed hybrid framework reduces EPE violations under a 3\,nm tolerance and roughly doubles throughput versus a strong numerical ILT baseline, while improving final mask quality. We also present over 20\% EPE improvement on \texttt{ICCAD13} contest cases with 3$\times$ speedup over the SOTA numerical ILT solver. By learning to propose ILT-friendly initializations, our approach mitigates non-convexity and advances beyond what traditional solvers or GenAI can achieve.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accepted by the 63th Design Automation Conference</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Detect Language Model Training Data via Active Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19020v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting LLM training data is generally framed as a membership inference attack (MIA) problem. However, conventional MIAs operate passively on fixed model weights, using log-likelihoods or text generations. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Active Data Reconstruction Attack} (ADRA), a family of MIA that actively induces a model to reconstruct a given text through training. We hypothesize that training data are \textit{more reconstructible} than non-members, and the difference in their reconstructibility can be exploited for membership inference. Motivated by findings that reinforcement learning (RL) sharpens behaviors already encoded in weights, we leverage on-policy RL to actively elicit data reconstruction by finetuning a policy initialized from the target model. To effectively use RL for MIA, we design reconstruction metrics and contrastive rewards. The resulting algorithms, \textsc{ADRA} and its adaptive variant \textsc{ADRA+}, improve both reconstruction and detection given a pool of candidate data. Experiments show that our methods consistently outperform existing MIAs in detecting pre-training, post-training, and distillation data, with an average improvement of 10.7\% over the previous runner-up. In particular, \MethodPlus~improves over Min-K\%++ by 18.8\% on BookMIA for pre-training detection and by 7.6\% on AIME for post-training detection.</p></details> |  |

The key question is how to estimate the temporal distance between pairs of observations. While temporal difference methods leverage local updates to provide optimality guarantees, they often perform worse than Monte Carlo methods that perform global updates (e.g., with multi-step returns), which lack such guarantees. We show how these approaches can be integrated into a practical offline GCRL method that fits a quasimetric distance using a multistep Monte-Carlo return. We show our method outperforms existing offline GCRL methods on long-horizon simulated tasks with up to 4000 steps, even with visual observations. We also demonstrate that our method can enable stitching in the real-world robotic manipulation domain (Bridge setup). Our approach is the first end-to-end offline GCRL method that enables multistep stitching in this real-world manipulation domain from an unlabeled offline dataset of visual observations and demonstrate robust horizon generalization.</p></details> |  |

Successful decentralized decision-making often depends not only on good individual actions, but on selecting compatible actions across agents to synchronize behavior, avoid conflicts, and satisfy global constraints. In this paper, we propose Action Graph Policies (AGP), that model dependencies among agents' available action choices. It constructs, what we call, \textit{coordination contexts}, that enable agents to condition their decisions on global action dependencies. Theoretically, we show that AGPs induce a strictly more expressive joint policy compared to fully independent policies and can realize coordinated joint actions that are provably more optimal than greedy execution even from centralized value-decomposition methods. Empirically, we show that AGP achieves 80-95\% success on canonical coordination tasks with partial observability and anti-coordination penalties, where other MARL methods reach only 10-25\%. We further demonstrate that AGP consistently outperforms these baselines in diverse multi-agent environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[MagicAgent: Towards Generalized Agent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19000v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive text processors to autonomous agents has established planning as a core component of modern intelligence. However, achieving generalized planning remains elusive, not only by the scarcity of high-quality interaction data but also by inherent conflicts across heterogeneous planning tasks. These challenges result in models that excel at isolated tasks yet struggle to generalize, while existing multi-task training attempts suffer from gradient interference. In this paper, we present \textbf{MagicAgent}, a series of foundation models specifically designed for generalized agent planning. We introduce a lightweight and scalable synthetic data framework that generates high-quality trajectories across diverse planning tasks, including hierarchical task decomposition, tool-augmented planning, multi-constraint scheduling, procedural logic orchestration, and long-horizon tool execution. To mitigate training conflicts, we propose a two-stage training paradigm comprising supervised fine-tuning followed by multi-objective reinforcement learning over both static datasets and dynamic environments. Empirical results demonstrate that MagicAgent-32B and MagicAgent-30B-A3B deliver superior performance, achieving accuracies of $75.1\%$ on Worfbench, $55.9\%$ on NaturalPlan, $57.5\%$ on $τ^2$-Bench, $86.9\%$ on BFCL-v3, and $81.2\%$ on ACEBench, as well as strong results on our in-house MagicEval benchmarks. These results substantially outperform existing sub-100B models and even surpass leading closed-source models.</p></details> |  |

However, current systems waste computational resources by processing all modalities with fixed heavyweight ensembles regardless of input complexity. To address these limitations, we propose IDSelect, a reinforcement learning-based cost-aware selector that chooses one pre-trained model per modality per-sequence to optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Our key insight is that an input-conditioned selector can discover complementary model choices that surpass fixed ensembles while using substantially fewer resources. IDSelect trains a lightweight agent end-to-end using actor-critic reinforcement learning with budget-aware optimization. The reward balances recognition accuracy with computational cost, while entropy regularization prevents premature convergence. At inference, the policy selects the most probable model per modality and fuses modality-specific similarities for the final score. Extensive experiments on challenging video-based datasets demonstrate IDSelect's superior efficiency: on CCVID, it achieves 95.9% Rank-1 accuracy with 92.4% less computation than strong baselines while improving accuracy by 1.8%; on MEVID, it reduces computation by 41.3% while maintaining competitive performance.</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions. Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration, yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches.

The framework is formulated as a contextual bandit problem and solved using incremental action-value estimation with a discretized state space to select optimal precision configurations for computational steps, balancing precision and computational efficiency. To verify its effectiveness, we apply the framework to iterative refinement for solving linear systems $Ax = b$. In this application, our approach dynamically chooses precisions based on calculated features from the system. In detail, a Q-table maps discretized features (e.g., approximate condition number and matrix norm)to actions (chosen precision configurations for specific steps), optimized via an epsilon-greedy strategy to maximize a multi-objective reward balancing accuracy and computational cost. Empirical results demonstrate effective precision selection, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy comparable to double-precision baselines. The framework generalizes to diverse out-of-sample data and offers insight into utilizing RL precision selection for other numerical algorithms, advancing mixed-precision numerical methods in scientific computing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on precision autotuning with RL and verified on unseen datasets.</p></details> |  |

We aim to maximize the overall Quality of Experience (QoE) of the users served over a UAV-assisted 5G wireless network. Our system model comprises a macro base station (MBS) and a UAV-mounted base station which both deploy mm-Wave transmission to the users. The 360$^\circ$ video is encoded into dependent layers and segmented tiles, allowing a user to schedule downloads of each layer's segments. Furthermore, each user utilizes multiple buffers to store the corresponding video layer's segments. We model the scheduling decision as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent selects Base or Enhancement layers to maximize the QoE and use a policy gradient-based method (PPO) to find the optimal policy. Additionally, we implement a dynamic adjustment mechanism for cost components, allowing the system to adaptively balance and prioritize the video quality, buffer occupancy, and quality change based on real-time network and streaming session conditions. We demonstrate that ASL360 significantly improves the QoE, achieving approximately 2 dB higher average video quality, 80% lower average rebuffering time, and 57% lower video quality variation, relative to competitive baseline methods. Our results show the effectiveness of our layered and adaptive approach in enhancing the QoE in immersive videostreaming applications, particularly in dynamic and challenging network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Discovering Multiagent Learning Algorithms with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16928v2)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Much of the advancement of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in imperfect-information games has historically depended on manual iterative refinement of baselines. While foundational families like Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) rest on solid theoretical ground, the design of their most effective variants often relies on human intuition to navigate a vast algorithmic design space. In this work, we propose the use of AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent powered by large language models, to automatically discover new multiagent learning algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by evolving novel variants for two distinct paradigms of game-theoretic learning. First, in the domain of iterative regret minimization, we evolve the logic governing regret accumulation and policy derivation, discovering a new algorithm, Volatility-Adaptive Discounted (VAD-)CFR. VAD-CFR employs novel, non-intuitive mechanisms-including volatility-sensitive discounting, consistency-enforced optimism, and a hard warm-start policy accumulation schedule-to outperform state-of-the-art baselines like Discounted Predictive CFR+. Second, in the regime of population based training algorithms, we evolve training-time and evaluation-time meta strategy solvers for PSRO, discovering a new variant, Smoothed Hybrid Optimistic Regret (SHOR-)PSRO. SHOR-PSRO introduces a hybrid meta-solver that linearly blends Optimistic Regret Matching with a smoothed, temperature-controlled distribution over best pure strategies. By dynamically annealing this blending factor and diversity bonuses during training, the algorithm automates the transition from population diversity to rigorous equilibrium finding, yielding superior empirical convergence compared to standard static meta-solvers.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSR: Trajectory-Search Rollouts for Multi-Turn RL of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11767v2)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in large language models (LLMs) are driving a shift toward using reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents from iterative, multi-turn interactions across tasks. However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe and Near-Optimal Control with Online Dynamics Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16650v2)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving both optimality and safety under unknown system dynamics is a central challenge in real-world deployment of agents. To address this, we introduce a notion of maximum safe dynamics learning, where sufficient exploration is performed within the space of safe policies. Our method executes $\textit{pessimistically}$ safe policies while $\textit{optimistically}$ exploring informative states and, despite not reaching them due to model uncertainty, ensures continuous online learning of dynamics. The framework achieves first-of-its-kind results: learning the dynamics model sufficiently $-$ up to an arbitrary small tolerance (subject to noise) $-$ in a finite time, while ensuring provably safe operation throughout with high probability and without requiring resets. Building on this, we propose an algorithm to maximize rewards while learning the dynamics $\textit{only to the extent needed}$ to achieve close-to-optimal performance. Unlike typical reinforcement learning (RL) methods, our approach operates online in a non-episodic setting and ensures safety throughout the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in challenging domains such as autonomous car racing and drone navigation under aerodynamic effects $-$ scenarios where safety is critical and accurate modeling is difficult.</p></details> |  |

Engineering capsids to overcome these hurdles is challenging due to the vast sequence space and the difficulty of simultaneously optimizing multiple functional properties. The complexity also adds when it comes to the kidney, which presents unique anatomical barriers and cellular targets that require precise and efficient vector engineering. Here, we present AAVGen, a generative artificial intelligence framework for de novo design of AAV capsids with enhanced multi-trait profiles. AAVGen integrates a protein language model (PLM) with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and a reinforcement learning technique termed Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO). The model is guided by a composite reward signal derived from three ESM-2-based regression predictors, each trained to predict a key property: production fitness, kidney tropism, and thermostability. Our results demonstrate that AAVGen produces a diverse library of novel VP1 protein sequences. In silico validations revealed that the majority of the generated variants have superior performance across all three employed indices, indicating successful multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, structural analysis via AlphaFold3 confirms that the generated sequences preserve the canonical capsid folding despite sequence diversification.

| **[RewardMap: Tackling Sparse Rewards in Fine-grained Visual Reasoning via Multi-Stage Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02240v2)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover, models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6 benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding and reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026, website: https://fscdc.github.io/RewardMap/</p></details> |

Because SO(3) admits no global, smooth, minimal parameterization, common representations such as Euler angles, quaternions, rotation matrices, and Lie algebra coordinates introduce distinct constraints and failure modes. While these trade-offs are well studied for supervised learning, their implications for actions in reinforcement learning remain unclear. We systematically evaluate SO(3) action representations across three standard continuous control algorithms, PPO, SAC, and TD3, under dense and sparse rewards. We compare how representations shape exploration, interact with entropy regularization, and affect training stability through empirical studies and analyze the implications of different projections for obtaining valid rotations from Euclidean network outputs. Across a suite of robotics benchmarks, we quantify the practical impact of these choices and distill simple, implementation-ready guidelines for selecting and using rotation actions. Our results highlight that representation-induced geometry strongly influences exploration and optimization and show that representing actions as tangent vectors in the local frame yields the most reliable results across algorithms.

A Benchmark for Long-Range Graph Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17762v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively capturing long-range interactions remains a fundamental yet unresolved challenge in graph neural network (GNN) research, critical for applications across diverse fields of science. To systematically address this, we introduce ECHO (Evaluating Communication over long HOps), a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess the capabilities of GNNs in handling very long-range graph propagation. ECHO includes three synthetic graph tasks, namely single-source shortest paths, node eccentricity, and graph diameter, each constructed over diverse and structurally challenging topologies intentionally designed to introduce significant information bottlenecks. ECHO also includes two real-world datasets, ECHO-Charge and ECHO-Energy, which define chemically grounded benchmarks for predicting atomic partial charges and molecular total energies, respectively, with reference computations obtained at the density functional theory (DFT) level. Both tasks inherently depend on capturing complex long-range molecular interactions. Our extensive benchmarking of popular GNN architectures reveals clear performance gaps, emphasizing the difficulty of true long-range propagation and highlighting design choices capable of overcoming inherent limitations. ECHO thereby sets a new standard for evaluating long-range information propagation, also providing a compelling example for its need in AI for science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026 ( https://openreview.net/forum?id=DgkWFPZMPp )</p></details> |
| **[A Secure and Private Distributed Bayesian Federated Learning Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20003v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed Federated Learning (DFL) enables decentralized model training across large-scale systems without a central parameter server. However, DFL faces three critical challenges: privacy leakage from honest-but-curious neighbors, slow convergence due to the lack of central coordination, and vulnerability to Byzantine adversaries aiming to degrade model accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel DFL framework that integrates Byzantine robustness, privacy preservation, and convergence acceleration. Within this framework, each device trains a local model using a Bayesian approach and independently selects an optimal subset of neighbors for posterior exchange. We formulate this neighbor selection as an optimization problem to minimize the global loss function under security and privacy constraints. Solving this problem is challenging because devices only possess partial network information, and the complex coupling between topology, security, and convergence remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first analytically characterize the trade-offs between dynamic connectivity, Byzantine detection, privacy levels, and convergence speed. Leveraging these insights, we develop a fully distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. This approach enables devices to make autonomous connection decisions based on local observations. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves superior robustness and efficiency with significantly lower overhead compared to traditional security and privacy schemes.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

We introduce SME-HGT, a Heterogeneous Graph Transformer framework that predicts which SBIR Phase I awardees will advance to Phase II funding using exclusively public data. We construct a heterogeneous graph with 32,268 company nodes, 124 research topic nodes, and 13 government agency nodes connected by approximately 99,000 edges across three semantic relation types. SME-HGT achieves an AUPRC of 0.621 0.003 on a temporally-split test set, outperforming an MLP baseline (0.590 0.002) and R-GCN (0.608 0.013) across five random seeds. At a screening depth of 100 companies, SME-HGT attains 89.6% precision with a 2.14 lift over random selection. Our temporal evaluation protocol prevents information leakage, and our reliance on public data ensures reproducibility. These results demonstrate that relational structure among firms, research topics, and funding agencies provides meaningful signal for SME potential assessment, with implications for policymakers and early-stage investors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Reasoning with Multi-View Fusion for Temporal Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19569v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Question Answering over Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGQA) has attracted growing interest for handling time-sensitive queries. However, existing methods still struggle with: 1) weak incorporation of temporal constraints in question representation, causing biased reasoning; 2) limited ability to perform explicit multi-hop reasoning; and 3) suboptimal fusion of language and graph representations. We propose a novel framework with temporal-aware question encoding, multi-hop graph reasoning, and multi-view heterogeneous information fusion. Specifically, our approach introduces: 1) a constraint-aware question representation that combines semantic cues from language models with temporal entity dynamics; 2) a temporal-aware graph neural network for explicit multi-hop reasoning via time-aware message passing; and 3) a multi-view attention mechanism for more effective fusion of question context and temporal graph knowledge. Experiments on multiple TKGQA benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over multiple baselines.</p></details> | 6pages |
| **[Training-Free Cross-Architecture Merging for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19332v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging has emerged as a powerful paradigm for combining the capabilities of distinct expert models without the high computational cost of retraining, yet current methods are fundamentally constrained to homogeneous architectures. For GNNs, however, message passing is topology-dependent and sensitive to misalignment, making direct parameter-space merging unreliable. To bridge this gap, we introduce H-GRAMA (Heterogeneous Graph Routing and Message Alignment), a training-free framework that lifts merging from parameter space to operator space. We formalize Universal Message Passing Mixture (UMPM), a shared operator family that expresses heterogeneous GNN layers in a common functional language. H-GRAMA enables cross-architecture GNN merging (e.g., GCN to GAT) without retraining, retaining high specialist accuracy in most cases in compatible depth settings and achieving inference speedups of 1.2x to 1.9x over ensembles.</p></details> |  |
| **[CTS-Bench: Benchmarking Graph Coarsening Trade-offs for GNNs in Clock Tree Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19330v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly explored for physical design analysis in Electronic Design Automation, particularly for modeling Clock Tree Synthesis behavior such as clock skew and buffering complexity. However, practical deployment remains limited due to the prohibitive memory and runtime cost of operating on raw gate-level netlists. Graph coarsening is commonly used to improve scalability, yet its impact on CTS-critical learning objectives is not well characterized. This paper introduces CTS-Bench, a benchmark suite for systematically evaluating the trade-offs between graph coarsening, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency in GNN-based CTS analysis. CTS-Bench consists of 4,860 converged physical design solutions spanning five architectures and provides paired raw gate-level and clustered graph representations derived from post-placement designs. Using clock skew prediction as a representative CTS task, we demonstrate a clear accuracy-efficiency trade-off. While graph coarsening reduces GPU memory usage by up to 17.2x and accelerates training by up to 3x, it also removes structural information essential for modeling clock distribution, frequently resulting in negative $R^2$ scores under zero-shot evaluation. Our findings indicate that generic graph clustering techniques can fundamentally compromise CTS learning objectives, even when global physical metrics remain unchanged. CTS-Bench enables principled evaluation of CTS-aware graph coarsening strategies, supports benchmarking of GNN architectures and accelerators under realistic physical design constraints, and provides a foundation for developing learning-assisted CTS analysis and optimization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ML Bench'26 ASPLOS</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Network Assisted Genetic Algorithm for Structural Dynamic Response and Parameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22839v3)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimization of structural parameters, such as mass(m), stiffness(k), and damping coefficient(c), is critical for designing efficient, resilient, and stable structures. Conventional numerical approaches, including Finite Element Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, provide high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive for iterative optimization tasks, as each evaluation requires solving the governing equations for every parameter combination. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven framework that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) surrogate model with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizer to overcome these challenges. The GNN is trained to accurately learn the nonlinear mapping between structural parameters and dynamic displacement responses, enabling rapid predictions without repeatedly solving the system equations. A dataset of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system responses is generated using the Newmark Beta method across diverse mass, stiffness, and damping configurations. The GA then searches for globally optimal parameter sets by minimizing predicted displacements and enhancing dynamic stability. Results demonstrate that the GNN and GA framework achieves strong convergence, robust generalization, and significantly reduced computational cost compared to conventional simulations. This approach highlights the effectiveness of combining machine learning surrogates with evolutionary optimization for automated and intelligent structural design.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Towards A Universal Graph Structural Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10917v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large-scale pre-training have shown the potential to learn generalizable representations for downstream tasks. In the graph domain, however, capturing and transferring structural information across different graph domains remains challenging, primarily due to the inherent differences in graph topological patterns across various contexts. For example, a social network's structure is fundamentally different from that of a product co-purchase graph. Additionally, most existing models struggle to capture the rich topological complexity of graph structures, leading to inadequate exploration of the graph embedding space. To address these challenges, we propose GFSE, a universal pre-trained graph encoder designed to capture transferable structural patterns across diverse domains such as the web graph, social networks, and citation networks. GFSE is the first cross-domain graph structural encoder pre-trained with multiple self-supervised learning objectives. Built on a Graph Transformer, GFSE incorporates attention mechanisms informed by graph structural information, enabling it to encode intricate multi-level and fine-grained topological features within complex graph structures. The pre-trained GFSE produces generic and theoretically expressive positional and structural encoding for graphs, which can be seamlessly integrated with various downstream graph feature encoders, including graph neural networks for vectorized features and Large Language Models (LLMs) for text-attributed graphs. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate GFSE's capability to significantly enhance the model's performance while requiring substantially less task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Node Affinity Prediction in Temporal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06940v3)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS - Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising, training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics.

| **[Covariance Density Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11139v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have re-defined how we model and predict on network data but there lacks a consensus on choosing the correct underlying graph structure on which to model signals. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNN) address this issue by using the sample covariance matrix as a Graph Shift Operator (GSO). Here, we improve on the performance of VNNs by constructing a Density Matrix where we consider the sample Covariance matrix as a quasi-Hamiltonian of the system in the space of random variables. Crucially, using this density matrix as the GSO allows components of the data to be extracted at different scales, allowing enhanced discriminability and performance. We show that this approach allows explicit control of the stability-discriminability trade-off of the network, provides enhanced robustness to noise compared to VNNs, and outperforms them in useful real-life applications where the underlying covariance matrix is informative. In particular, we show that our model can achieve strong performance in subject-independent Brain Computer Interface EEG motor imagery classification, outperforming EEGnet while being faster. This shows how covariance density neural networks provide a basis for the notoriously difficult task of transferability of BCIs when evaluated on unseen individuals.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEDAN: Learning the Edit Costs for Graph Edit Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03111v3)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). However, most NN methods assume a unit cost for edit operations -- a restrictive and often unrealistic simplification, since topological and functional distances rarely coincide in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a fully end-to-end Graph Neural Network framework for learning the edit costs for GED, at a fine-grained level, aligning topological and task-specific similarity. Our method combines an unsupervised self-organizing mechanism for GED approximation with a Generalized Additive Model that flexibly learns contextualized edit costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach overcomes the limitations of non-end-to-end methods, yielding directly interpretable graph matchings, uncovering meaningful structures in complex graphs, and showing strong applicability to domains such as molecular analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Graph Neural Networks for Graph-level Tasks: Taxonomy, Empirical Study, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00773v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are fundamental data structures for modeling complex interactions in domains such as social networks, molecular structures, and biological systems. Graph-level tasks, which involve predicting properties or labels for entire graphs, are crucial for applications like molecular property prediction and subgraph counting. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant promise for these tasks, their evaluations are often limited by narrow datasets, task coverage, and inconsistent experimental setups, hindering their generalizability. In this paper, we present a comprehensive experimental study of GNNs on graph-level tasks, systematically categorizing them into five types: node-based, hierarchical pooling-based, subgraph-based, graph learning-based, and self-supervised learning-based GNNs. To address these challenges, we propose a unified evaluation framework OpenGLT for graph-level GNNs. OpenGLT standardizes the evaluation process across diverse datasets, multiple graph tasks (e.g., classification and regression), and real-world scenarios, including noisy, imbalanced, and few-shot graphs. Extensive experiments are conducted on 16 baseline models across five categories, evaluated on 13 graph classification and 13 graph regression datasets. These experiments provide comprehensive insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing GNN architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[E2E-GRec: An End-to-End Joint Training Framework for Graph Neural Networks and Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20564v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling graph-structured data and have been widely used in recommender systems, such as for capturing complex user-item and item-item relations. However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks Powered by Encoder Embedding for Improved Node Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11732v2)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for a wide range of node-level graph learning tasks. However, their performance typically depends on random or minimally informed initial feature representations, where poor initialization can lead to slower convergence and increased training instability. In this paper, we address this limitation by leveraging a statistically grounded one-hot graph encoder embedding (GEE) as a high-quality, structure-aware initialization for node features. Integrating GEE into standard GNNs yields the GEE-powered GNN (GG) framework. Across extensive simulations and real-world benchmarks, GG provides consistent and substantial performance gains in both unsupervised and supervised settings. For node classification, we further introduce GG-C, which concatenates the outputs of GG and GEE and outperforms competing methods, achieving roughly 10-50% accuracy improvements across most datasets. These results demonstrate the importance of principled, structure-aware initialization for improving the efficiency, stability, and overall performance of graph neural network architecture, enabling models to better exploit graph topology from the outset.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Network(GNN), is proven to be an effective KG embedding technique that enables various downstream tasks like link prediction, node classification, and graph classification. The focus of research in both KG embedding and GNNs has been mostly oriented towards simple graphs with binary relations. However, real-world knowledge bases have a significant share of complex and n-ary facts that cannot be represented by binary edges. More specifically, real-world knowledge bases are often a mix of two types of n-ary facts - (i) that require hyperedges and (ii) that require hyper-relational edges. Though there are research efforts catering to these n-ary fact types, they are pursued independently for each type. We propose $H$yper$E$dge $H$yper-$R$elational edge $GNN$(HEHRGNN), a unified embedding model for n-ary relational KGs with both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges. The two main components of the model are i)HEHR unified fact representation format, and ii)HEHRGNN encoder, a GNN-based encoder with a novel message propagation model capable of capturing complex graph structures comprising both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges. The experimental results of HEHRGNN on link prediction tasks show its effectiveness as a unified embedding model, with inductive prediction capability, for link prediction across real-world datasets having different types of n-ary facts. The model also shows improved link prediction performance over baseline models for hyperedge and hyper-relational datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 Pa...</summary><p>38 Pages paper and 1 highlights page, 9 figures, 10 tables, Submitted to Elsevier Knowledge-Based Systems journal</p></details> |
| **[Are We Measuring Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks Correctly?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04591v4)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oversmoothing is a fundamental challenge in graph neural networks (GNNs): as the number of layers increases, node embeddings become increasingly similar, and model performance drops sharply. Traditionally, oversmoothing has been quantified using metrics that measure the similarity of neighbouring node features, such as the Dirichlet energy. We argue that these metrics have critical limitations and fail to reliably capture oversmoothing in realistic scenarios. For instance, they provide meaningful insights only for very deep networks, while typical GNNs show a performance drop already with as few as 10 layers. As an alternative, we propose measuring oversmoothing by examining the numerical or effective rank of the feature representations. We provide extensive numerical evaluation across diverse graph architectures and datasets to show that rank-based metrics consistently capture oversmoothing, whereas energy-based metrics often fail. Notably, we reveal that drops in the rank align closely with performance degradation, even in scenarios where energy metrics remain unchanged. Along with the experimental evaluation, we provide theoretical support for this approach, clarifying why Dirichlet-like measures may fail to capture performance drop and proving that the numerical rank of feature representations collapses to one for a broad family of GNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[L2G-Net: Local to Global Spectral Graph Neural Networks via Cauchy Factorizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18837v1)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their theoretical advantages, spectral methods based on the graph Fourier transform (GFT) are seldom used in graph neural networks (GNNs) due to the cost of computing the eigenbasis and the lack of vertex-domain locality in spectral representations. As a result, most GNNs rely on local approximations such as polynomial Laplacian filters or message passing, which limit their ability to model long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce a novel factorization of the GFT into operators acting on subgraphs, which are then combined via a sequence of Cauchy matrices. We use this factorization to propose a new class of spectral GNNs, which we term L2G-Net (Local-to-Global Net). Unlike existing spectral methods, which are either fully global (when they use the GFT) or local (when they use polynomial filters), L2G-Net operates by processing the spectral representations of subgraphs and then combining them via structured matrices. Our algorithm avoids full eigendecompositions, exploiting graph topology to construct the factorization with quadratic complexity in the number of nodes, scaled by the subgraph interface size. Experiments on benchmarks stressing non-local dependencies show that L2G-Net outperforms existing spectral techniques and is competitive with the state-of-the-art with orders of magnitude fewer learnable parameters.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches based on manual curation and literature review are labour-intensive and not scalable, prompting the use of machine learning on large biomedical data. In particular, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise for modelling complex biological relationships. To address limitations in existing models, we propose GLaDiGAtor (Graph Learning-bAsed DIsease-Gene AssociaTiOn pRediction), a novel GNN framework with an encoder-decoder architecture for disease-gene association prediction. GLaDiGAtor constructs a heterogeneous biological graph integrating gene-gene, disease-disease, and gene-disease interactions from curated databases, and enriches each node with contextual features from well-known language models (ProtT5 for protein sequences and BioBERT for disease text). In evaluations, our model achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalisation, outperforming 14 existing methods. Literature-supported case studies confirm the biological relevance of high-confidence novel predictions, highlighting GLaDiGAtor's potential to discover candidate disease genes. These results underscore the power of graph convolutional networks in biomedical informatics and may ultimately facilitate drug discovery by revealing new gene-disease links.

In this work, we introduce several novel concepts and capabilities to address obstacles faced by machine-assisted theorem proving. We first present a set of \textbf{atomic tactics}, a small finite set of tactics capable of proving any provable statement in Lean. We then introduce a \textbf{transposing atomization} algorithm which turns arbitrary proof expressions into a series of atomic tactics. We next introduce the \textbf{ExprGraph} data structure, which provides a succinct representation for Lean expressions. Finally, we present the \textbf{Nazrin Prover}, a graph neural network-based theorem proving agent using atomic tactics and ExprGraph. Nazrin circumvents many challenges faced by existing proving agents by exclusively dispatching atomic tactics, and it is robust enough to both train and evaluate on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the potential of tools like Nazrin using theorems from Lean's standard library and from Mathlib.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

Traditional methods often require prior knowledge and are susceptible to external disturbances. Learning-driven alternatives, while promising, frequently struggle with the scarcity of training data and fall short in generalization. To address these challenges, we propose Depth-PC, a novel visual servoing framework that leverages decoupled simulation-based training from real-world inference, achieving zero-shot Sim2Real transfer for servo tasks. To exploit spatial and geometric information of depth and point cloud features, we introduce cross-modal feature fusion, a first in servo tasks, followed by a dedicated Graph Neural Network to establish keypoint correspondences. Through simulation and real-world experiments, our approach demonstrates superior convergence basin and accuracy compared to SOTA methods, fulfilling the requirements for robotic servo tasks while enabling zero-shot Sim2Real transfer. In addition to the enhancements achieved with our proposed framework, we have also demonstrated the effectiveness of cross-modality feature fusion within the realm of servo tasks.

However, it often faces the issue of over-smoothing as the model depth increases, which causes all node representations to converge to a single value and become indistinguishable. This issue stems from the inherent limitations of GNNs, which struggle to distinguish the importance of information from different neighborhoods. In this paper, we introduce MbaGCN, a novel graph convolutional architecture that draws inspiration from the Mamba paradigm-originally designed for sequence modeling. MbaGCN presents a new backbone for GNNs, consisting of three key components: the Message Aggregation Layer, the Selective State Space Transition Layer, and the Node State Prediction Layer. These components work in tandem to adaptively aggregate neighborhood information, providing greater flexibility and scalability for deep GNN models. While MbaGCN may not consistently outperform all existing methods on each dataset, it provides a foundational framework that demonstrates the effective integration of the Mamba paradigm into graph representation learning. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that MbaGCN paves the way for future advancements in graph neural network research.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Stuart-Landau Oscillatory Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08094v2)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oscillatory Graph Neural Networks (OGNNs) are an emerging class of physics-inspired architectures designed to mitigate oversmoothing and vanishing gradient problems in deep GNNs. In this work, we introduce the Complex-Valued Stuart-Landau Graph Neural Network (SLGNN), a novel architecture grounded in Stuart-Landau oscillator dynamics. Stuart-Landau oscillators are canonical models of limit-cycle behavior near Hopf bifurcations, which are fundamental to synchronization theory and are widely used in e.g. neuroscience for mesoscopic brain modeling. Unlike harmonic oscillators and phase-only Kuramoto models, Stuart-Landau oscillators retain both amplitude and phase dynamics, enabling rich phenomena such as amplitude regulation and multistable synchronization. The proposed SLGNN generalizes existing phase-centric Kuramoto-based OGNNs by allowing node feature amplitudes to evolve dynamically according to Stuart-Landau dynamics, with explicit tunable hyperparameters (such as the Hopf-parameter and the coupling strength) providing additional control over the interplay between feature amplitudes and network structure. We conduct extensive experiments across node classification, graph classification, and graph regression tasks, demonstrating that SLGNN outperforms existing OGNNs and establishes a novel, expressive, and theoretically grounded framework for deep oscillatory architectures on graphs.</p></details> |  |

However, such claims risk being unsolid due to a lack of standard benchmarks on truly hard instances. From a statistical physics perspective, we propose new hard benchmarks based on random problems. We provide these benchmarks, along with performance results from both classical heuristics and GNNs. Our fair comparison shows that classical algorithms still outperform GNNs. We discuss the challenges for neural networks in this domain. Future claims of superiority can be made more robust using our benchmarks, available at https://github.com/ArtLabBocconi/RandCSPBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying approach to uniform expressivity of graph neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18409v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is often analysed via correspondence to the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm and fragments of first-order logic. Standard GNNs are limited to performing aggregation over immediate neighbourhoods or over global read-outs. To increase their expressivity, recent attempts have been made to incorporate substructural information (e.g. cycle counts and subgraph properties). In this paper, we formalize this architectural trend by introducing Template GNNs (T-GNNs), a generalized framework where node features are updated by aggregating over valid template embeddings from a specified set of graph templates. We propose a corresponding logic, Graded template modal logic (GML(T)), and generalized notions of template-based bisimulation and WL algorithm. We establish an equivalence between the expressive power of T-GNNs and GML(T), and provide a unifying approach for analysing GNN expressivity: we show how standard AC-GNNs and its recent variants can be interpreted as instantiations of T-GNNs.</p></details> |  |

However, current PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the soft constraint on the physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption. We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases to form a fully differentiable knownoperator layer inside the computation graph, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of 4-32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage and 0.08 deg in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5% and 87.1%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2-5x faster batched inference than NR on 4-1024-bus grids.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2026. 5 pages, 2 figures.

However, they are often limited by scarce experimental property data and lack thermodynamic consistency. As such, thermodynamics-informed ML, i.e., incorporating thermodynamic relations into the loss function as regularization term for training, has been proposed. We herein transfer the concept of thermodynamics-informed graph neural networks (GNNs) from the Gibbs-Duhem to the Clapeyron equation, predicting several pure component properties in a multi-task manner, namely: vapor pressure, liquid molar volume, vapor molar volume and enthalpy of vaporization. We find improved prediction accuracy of the Clapeyron-GNN compared to the single-task learning setting, and improved approximation of the Clapeyron equation compared to the purely data-driven multi-task learning setting. In fact, we observe the largest improvement in prediction accuracy for the properties with the lowest availability of data, making our model promising for practical application in data scarce scenarios of chemical engineering practice.</p></details> |  |

Non-invasive, in-vivo measurement of these quantities can only be performed using a select number of modalities that are not widely available, such as 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this work, we create a surrogate model for hemodynamic flow field estimation, powered by machine learning. We train graph neural networks that include priors about the underlying symmetries and physics, limiting the amount of data required for training. This allows us to train the model using moderately-sized, in-vivo 4D flow MRI datasets, instead of large in-silico datasets obtained by computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as is the current standard. We create an efficient, equivariant neural network by combining the popular PointNet++ architecture with group-steerable layers. To incorporate the physics-informed priors, we derive an efficient discretisation scheme for the involved differential operators. We perform extensive experiments in carotid arteries and show that our model can accurately estimate low-noise hemodynamic flow fields in the carotid artery. Moreover, we show how the learned relation between geometry and hemodynamic quantities transfers to 3D vascular models obtained using a different imaging modality than the training data. This shows that physics-informed graph neural networks can be trained using 4D flow MRI data to estimate blood flow in unseen carotid artery geometries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in "Medical Image Analysis"</p></details> |
| **[Stable Long-Horizon Spatiotemporal Prediction on Meshes Using Latent Multiscale Recurrent Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18146v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate long-horizon prediction of spatiotemporal fields on complex geometries is a fundamental challenge in scientific machine learning, with applications such as additive manufacturing where temperature histories govern defect formation and mechanical properties. High-fidelity simulations are accurate but computationally costly, and despite recent advances, machine learning methods remain challenged by long-horizon temperature and gradient prediction. We propose a deep learning framework for predicting full temperature histories directly on meshes, conditioned on geometry and process parameters, while maintaining stability over thousands of time steps and generalizing across heterogeneous geometries. The framework adopts a temporal multiscale architecture composed of two coupled models operating at complementary time scales. Both models rely on a latent recurrent graph neural network to capture spatiotemporal dynamics on meshes, while a variational graph autoencoder provides a compact latent representation that reduces memory usage and improves training stability. Experiments on simulated powder bed fusion data demonstrate accurate and temporally stable long-horizon predictions across diverse geometries, outperforming existing baseline. Although evaluated in two dimensions, the framework is general and extensible to physics-driven systems with multiscale dynamics and to three-dimensional geometries.</p></details> |  |

Existing remedies such as graph transformers or rewiring typically incur high computational cost or require altering the graph structure. We introduce a Bakry-Emery graph Laplacian that integrates diffusion and advection through a learnable node-wise potential, inducing task-dependent propagation dynamics without modifying topology. This operator has a well-behaved spectral decomposition and acts as a drop-in replacement for standard Laplacians in spectral GNNs. Building on this insight, we develop mu-ChebNet, a spectral architecture that jointly learns the potential and Chebyshev filters, effectively bridging message-passing adaptivity and spectral efficiency. Our theoretical analysis shows how the potential modulates the spectrum, enabling control of key graph properties. Empirically, mu-ChebNet delivers consistent gains on synthetic long-range reasoning tasks, as well as real-world benchmarks, while offering an interpretable routing field that reveals how information flows through the graph. This establishes the Bakry-Emery Laplacian as a principled and efficient foundation for adaptive spectral graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Understanding and decoding cognitive brain states from fMRI depends on how functional interactions are represented. We propose an ensemble-based graph representation in which each edge weight encodes state evidence as the difference between posterior probabilities of two states, estimated by an ensemble of edge-wise probabilistic classifiers from simple pairwise time-series features. We evaluate the method on seven task-fMRI paradigms from the Human Connectome Project, performing binary classification within each paradigm. Using compact node summaries (mean incident edge weights) and logistic regression, we obtain average accuracies of 97.07-99.74 %. We further compare ensemble graphs with conventional correlation graphs using the same graph neural network classifier; ensemble graphs consistently yield higher accuracy (88.00-99.42 % vs 61.86-97.94 % across tasks). Because edge weights have a probabilistic, state-oriented interpretation, the representation supports connection- and region-level interpretability and can be extended to multiclass decoding, regression, other neuroimaging modalities, and clinical classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Simple Graphs: Neural Multi-Objective Routing on Multigraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22095v5)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. Yet, existing methods are unsuitable for routing on multigraphs, which feature multiple edges with distinct attributes between node pairs, despite their strong relevance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose two graph neural network-based methods to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach operates directly on the multigraph by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. The second model, which is more scalable, first simplifies the multigraph via a learned pruning strategy and then performs autoregressive routing on the resulting simple graph. We evaluate both models empirically, across a wide range of problems and graph distributions, and demonstrate their competitive performance compared to strong heuristics and neural baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026, Final Camera-Ready Version. 34 pages, 6 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Co-Evolution-Based Metal-Binding Residue Prediction with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16189v2)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding protein-metal interactions is central to structural biology, with metal ions being vital for catalysis, stability, and signal transduction. Predicting metal-binding residues and metal types remains challenging due to the structural and evolutionary complexity of proteins. Conventional sequence- and structure-based methods often fail to capture co-evolutionary constraints that reflect how residues evolve together to maintain metal-binding functionality. Recent co-evolution-based methods capture part of this information, but still underutilize the complete co-evolved residue network. To address this limitation, we introduce the Metal-Binding Graph Neural Network (MBGNN), which leverages the complete co-evolved residue network to better capture complex dependencies within protein structures. Experimental results show that MBGNN substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art co-evolution-based method MetalNet2, achieving F1 score improvements of 2.5% for binding residue identification and 3.3% for metal type classification on the MetalNet2 dataset. Its superiority is further demonstrated on both the MetalNet2 and MIonSite datasets, where it outperforms two co-evolution-based and two sequence-based methods, achieving the highest mean F1 scores across both prediction tasks. These findings highlight how integrating co-evolutionary residue networks with graph-based learning advances our ability to decode protein-metal interactions, thereby facilitating functional annotation and rational metalloprotein design. The code and data are released at https://github.com/SRastegari/MBGNN.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Generating adversarial inputs for a graph neural network model of AC power flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17975v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work formulates and solves optimization problems to generate input points that yield high errors between a neural network's predicted AC power flow solution and solutions to the AC power flow equations. We demonstrate this capability on an instance of the CANOS-PF graph neural network model, as implemented by the PF$Δ$ benchmark library, operating on a 14-bus test grid. Generated adversarial points yield errors as large as 3.4 per-unit in reactive power and 0.08 per-unit in voltage magnitude. When minimizing the perturbation from a training point necessary to satisfy adversarial constraints, we find that the constraints can be met with as little as an 0.04 per-unit perturbation in voltage magnitude on a single bus. This work motivates the development of rigorous verification and robust training methods for neural network surrogate models of AC power flow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Neural Multi-Agent Coordination for Distributed Access-Point Selection in Cell-Free Massive MIMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17954v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell-free massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) systems require scalable and reliable distributed coordination mechanisms to operate under stringent communication and latency constraints. A central challenge is the Access Point Selection (APS) problem, which seeks to determine the subset of serving Access Points (APs) for each User Equipment (UE) that can satisfy UEs' Spectral Efficiency (SE) requirements while minimizing network power consumption. We introduce APS-GNN, a scalable distributed multi-agent learning framework that decomposes APS into agents operating at the granularity of individual AP-UE connections. Agents coordinate via local observation exchange over a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture and share parameters to reuse their knowledge and experience. APS-GNN adopts a constrained reinforcement learning approach to provide agents with explicit observability of APS' conflicting objectives, treating SE satisfaction as a cost and power reduction as a reward. Both signals are defined locally, facilitating effective credit assignment and scalable coordination in large networks. To further improve training stability and exploration efficiency, the policy is initialized via supervised imitation learning from a heuristic APS baseline. We develop a realistic CFmMIMO simulator and demonstrate that APS-GNN delivers the target SE while activating 50-70% fewer APs than heuristic and centralized Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) baselines in different evaluation scenarios. Moreover, APS-GNN achieves one to two orders of magnitude lower inference latency than centralized MARL approaches due to its fully parallel and distributed execution. These results establish APS-GNN as a practical and scalable solution for APS in large-scale CFmMIMO networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission to an IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Graph Causal Classification Models: Estimating Causal Effects and Addressing Confounders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17941v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data is becoming increasingly prevalent due to the growing demand for relational insights in AI across various domains. Organizations regularly use graph data to solve complex problems involving relationships and connections. Causal learning is especially important in this context, since it helps to understand cause-effect relationships rather than mere associations. Since many real-world systems are inherently causal, graphs can efficiently model these systems. However, traditional graph machine learning methods including graph neural networks (GNNs), rely on correlations and are sensitive to spurious patterns and distribution changes. On the other hand, causal models enable robust predictions by isolating true causal factors, thus making them more stable under such shifts. Causal learning also helps in identifying and adjusting for confounders, ensuring that predictions reflect true causal relationships and remain accurate even under interventions. To address these challenges and build models that are robust and causally informed, we propose CCAGNN, a Confounder-Aware causal GNN framework that incorporates causal reasoning into graph learning, supporting counterfactual reasoning and providing reliable predictions in real-world settings. Comprehensive experiments on six publicly available datasets from diverse domains show that CCAGNN consistently outperforms leading state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Neighbourhood Learning for Invariant Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17934v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data often contain noisy and spurious correlations that mask the true causal relationships, which are essential for enabling graph models to make predictions based on the underlying causal structure of the data. Dependence on spurious connections makes it challenging for traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generalize effectively across different graphs. Furthermore, traditional aggregation methods tend to amplify these spurious patterns, limiting model robustness under distribution shifts. To address these issues, we propose Causal Neighbourhood Learning with Graph Neural Networks (CNL-GNN), a novel framework that performs causal interventions on graph structure. CNL-GNN effectively identifies and preserves causally relevant connections and reduces spurious influences through the generation of counterfactual neighbourhoods and adaptive edge perturbation guided by learnable importance masking and an attention-based mechanism. In addition, by combining structural-level interventions with the disentanglement of causal features from confounding factors, the model learns invariant node representations that are robust and generalize well across different graph structures. Our approach improves causal graph learning beyond traditional feature-based methods, resulting in a robust classification model. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets, including multiple domain variants of one dataset, demonstrate that CNL-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViGText: Deepfake Image Detection with Vision-Language Model Explanations and Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18031v2)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes. Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes, helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.</p></details> |  |
| **[COMBA: Cross Batch Aggregation for Learning Large Graphs with Context Gating State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17893v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) have recently emerged for modeling long-range dependency in sequence data, with much simplified computational costs than modern alternatives, such as transformers. Advancing SMMs to graph structured data, especially for large graphs, is a significant challenge because SSMs are sequence models and the shear graph volumes make it very expensive to convert graphs as sequences for effective learning. In this paper, we propose COMBA to tackle large graph learning using state space models, with two key innovations: graph context gating and cross batch aggregation. Graph context refers to different hops of neighborhood for each node, and graph context gating allows COMBA to use such context to learn best control of neighbor aggregation. For each graph context, COMBA samples nodes as batches, and train a graph neural network (GNN), with information being aggregated cross batches, allowing COMBA to scale to large graphs. Our theoretical study asserts that cross-batch aggregation guarantees lower error than training GNN without aggregation. Experiments on benchmark networks demonstrate significant performance gains compared to baseline approaches. Code and benchmark datasets will be released for public access.</p></details> |  |

While decentralized protocols increasingly adopt zero-knowledge proofs to obfuscate transaction graphs, centralized stablecoins remain critical "transparent choke points" for compliance. Leveraging this persistent visibility, this study analyzes an Ethereum dataset and uses behavioral features to develop a robust AML framework. Our findings demonstrate that domain-informed tree ensemble models achieve higher Macro-F1 score, significantly outperforming graph neural networks, which struggle with the increasing fragmentation of transaction networks. The model's interpretability goes beyond binary detection, successfully dissecting distinct typologies: it differentiates the complex, high-velocity dispersion of cybercrime syndicates from the constrained, static footprints left by sanctioned entities. This framework aligns with the industry shift toward deterministic verification, satisfying the auditability and compliance expectations under regulations such as the EU's MiCA and the U.S. GENIUS Act while minimizing unjustified asset freezes. By automating high-precision detection, we propose an approach that effectively raises the economic cost of financial misconduct without stifling innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |

This work presents a framework that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based dynamics models with structure-exploiting Model Predictive Control to enable real-time control of high-dimensional systems. By representing the system as a graph with localized interactions, the GNN preserves sparsity, while a tailored condensing algorithm eliminates state variables from the control problem, ensuring efficient computation. The complexity of our condensing algorithm scales linearly with the number of system nodes, and leverages Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) parallelization to achieve real-time performance. The proposed approach is validated in simulation and experimentally on a physical soft robotic trunk. Results show that our method scales to systems with up to 1,000 nodes at 100 Hz in closed-loop, and demonstrates real-time reference tracking on hardware with sub-centimeter accuracy, outperforming baselines by 63.6%. Finally, we show the capability of our method to achieve effective full-body obstacle avoidance.</p></details> |  |

While GNNs have demonstrated broad applicability, understanding their expressive power remains an important question. In this paper, we propose GNN architectures that correspond precisely to prominent fragments of first-order logic (FO), including various modal logics as well as more expressive two-variable fragments. To establish these results, we apply methods from finite model theory of first-order and modal logics to the domain of graph representation learning. Our results provide a unifying framework for understanding the logical expressiveness of GNNs within FO.</p></details> | 21 pages |

Recent advances in graph OOD detection have focused on test-time training techniques that facilitate OOD detection without accessing potential supervisory information (e.g., training data). However, most of these methods employ a one-pass inference paradigm, which prevents them from progressively correcting erroneous predictions to amplify OOD signals. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{I}mproving \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}ut-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{D}istribution detector (SIGOOD), which is an unsupervised framework that integrates continuous self-learning with test-time training for effective graph OOD detection. Specifically, SIGOOD generates a prompt to construct a prompt-enhanced graph that amplifies potential OOD signals. To optimize prompts, SIGOOD introduces an Energy Preference Optimization (EPO) loss, which leverages energy variations between the original test graph and the prompt-enhanced graph. By iteratively optimizing the prompt by involving it into the detection model in a self-improving loop, the resulting optimal prompt-enhanced graph is ultimately used for OOD detection. Comprehensive evaluations on 21 real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness and outperformance of our SIGOOD method. The code is at https://github.com/Ee1s/SIGOOD.</p></details> | 9pages, 5 figures |

To address this gap, we study an aggregate-and-readout model that encompasses several common message passing architectures: node features are first propagated over the graph then mapped to responses via a nonlinear function. For least-squares estimation over GNNs with linear graph convolutions and a deep ReLU readout, we prove a sharp non-asymptotic risk bound that separates approximation, stochastic, and optimization errors. The bound makes explicit how performance scales with the fraction of labeled nodes and graph-induced dependence. Approximation guarantees are further derived for graph-smoothing followed by smooth nonlinear readouts, yielding convergence rates that recover classical nonparametric behavior under full supervision while characterizing performance when labels are scarce. Numerical experiments validate our theory, providing a systematic framework for understanding GNN performance and limitations.</p></details> | 57 pages, 7 figures |

However, it remains unclear when multi-hop structural reasoning is actually necessary. In this work, we introduce locality radius, a formal measure of the minimum structural neighborhood required to determine a prediction in relational schemas. We hypothesize that model performance depends critically on alignment between task locality radius and architectural aggregation depth. We conduct a controlled empirical study across foreign key prediction, join cost estimation, blast radius regression, cascade impact classification, and additional graph-derived schema tasks. Our evaluation includes multi-seed experiments, capacity-matched comparisons, statistical significance testing, scaling analysis, and synthetic radius-controlled benchmarks. Results reveal a consistent bias-radius alignment effect.</p></details> |  |

To address these systemic vulnerabilities, we present AdvSynGNN, a comprehensive architecture designed for resilient node-level representation learning. The proposed framework orchestrates multi-resolution structural synthesis alongside contrastive objectives to establish geometry-sensitive initializations. We develop a transformer backbone that adaptively accommodates heterophily by modulating attention mechanisms through learned topological signals. Central to our contribution is an integrated adversarial propagation engine, where a generative component identifies potential connectivity alterations while a discriminator enforces global coherence. Furthermore, label refinement is achieved through a residual correction scheme guided by per-node confidence metrics, which facilitates precise control over iterative stability. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this synergistic approach effectively optimizes predictive accuracy across diverse graph distributions while maintaining computational efficiency. The study concludes with practical implementation protocols to ensure the robust deployment of the AdvSynGNN system in large-scale environments.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |

While self-explainable GNNs attempt to bridge this gap, they often rely on standard message-passing backbones that inherit fundamental limitations, including the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) expressivity barrier and a lack of fine-grained interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose SymGraph, a symbolic framework designed to transcend these constraints. By replacing continuous message passing with discrete structural hashing and topological role-based aggregation, our architecture theoretically surpasses the 1-WL barrier, achieving superior expressiveness without the overhead of differentiable optimization. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that SymGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing self-explainable GNNs.

| **[Predicting The Cop Number Using Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16600v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cops and Robbers is a pursuit evasion game played on a graph, first introduced independently by Quilliot \cite{quilliot1978jeux} and Nowakowski and Winkler \cite{NOWAKOWSKI1983235} over four decades ago. A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible.</p></details> | 8 pages |

We present an FPGA implementation of event-graph neural networks for audio processing. We utilise an artificial cochlea that converts time-series signals into sparse event data, reducing memory and computation costs. Our architecture was implemented on a SoC FPGA and evaluated on two open-source datasets. For classification task, our baseline floating-point model achieves 92.7% accuracy on SHD dataset - only 2.4% below the state of the art - while requiring over 10x and 67x fewer parameters. On SSC, our models achieve 66.9-71.0% accuracy. Compared to FPGA-based spiking neural networks, our quantised model reaches 92.3% accuracy, outperforming them by up to 19.3% while reducing resource usage and latency. For SSC, we report the first hardware-accelerated evaluation. We further demonstrate the first end-to-end FPGA implementation of event-audio keyword spotting, combining graph convolutional layers with recurrent sequence modelling. The system achieves up to 95% word-end detection accuracy, with only 10.53 microsecond latency and 1.18 W power consumption, establishing a strong benchmark for energy-efficient event-driven KWS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under revision in TRETS Journal</p></details> |

This concept is developed within a one-dimensional framework as a foundational step. Traditional numerical methods, while effective, are computationally intensive and less scalable. By utilizing GNNs, the proposed model, termed the Collision-captured Network (CN), integrates data assimilation (DA) techniques to effectively learn and predict sea ice dynamics under various conditions. The approach was validated using synthetic data, both with and without observed data points, and it was found that the model accelerates the simulation of trajectories without compromising accuracy. This advancement offers a more efficient tool for forecasting in marginal ice zones (MIZ) and highlights the potential of combining machine learning with data assimilation for more effective and efficient modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating GNN Convergence on Large Randomly Generated Graphs with Realistic Node Feature Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16145v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are a number of existing studies analysing the convergence behaviour of graph neural networks on large random graphs. Unfortunately, the majority of these studies do not model correlations between node features, which would naturally exist in a variety of real-life networks. Consequently, the derived limitations of GNNs, resulting from such convergence behaviour, is not truly reflective of the expressive power of GNNs when applied to realistic graphs. In this paper, we will introduce a novel method to generate random graphs that have correlated node features. The node features will be sampled in such a manner to ensure correlation between neighbouring nodes. As motivation for our choice of sampling scheme, we will appeal to properties exhibited by real-life graphs, particularly properties that are captured by the Barabási-Albert model. A theoretical analysis will strongly indicate that convergence can be avoided in some cases, which we will empirically validate on large random graphs generated using our novel method. The observed divergent behaviour provides evidence that GNNs may be more expressive than initial studies would suggest, especially on realistic graphs.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Federated Graph AGI for Cross-Border Insider Threat Intelligence in Government Financial Schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16109v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-border insider threats pose a critical challenge to government financial schemes, particularly when dealing with distributed, privacy-sensitive data across multiple jurisdictions. Existing approaches face fundamental limitations: they cannot effectively share intelligence across borders due to privacy constraints, lack reasoning capabilities to understand complex multi-step attack patterns, and fail to capture intricate graph-structured relationships in financial networks. We introduce FedGraph-AGI, a novel federated learning framework integrating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) reasoning with graph neural networks for privacy-preserving cross-border insider threat detection. Our approach combines: (1) federated graph neural networks preserving data sovereignty; (2) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) aggregation for heterogeneous jurisdictions; and (3) AGI-powered reasoning via Large Action Models (LAM) performing causal inference over graph data. Through experiments on a 50,000-transaction dataset across 10 jurisdictions, FedGraph-AGI achieves 92.3% accuracy, significantly outperforming federated baselines (86.1%) and centralized approaches (84.7%). Our ablation studies reveal AGI reasoning contributes 6.8% improvement, while MoE adds 4.4%. The system maintains epsilon = 1.0 differential privacy while achieving near-optimal performance and scales efficiently to 50+ clients. This represents the first integration of AGI reasoning with federated graph learning for insider threat detection, opening new directions for privacy-preserving cross-border intelligence sharing.</p></details> | 35 Pages, 8 figures |
| **[MolCrystalFlow: Molecular Crystal Structure Prediction via Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16020v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular crystal structure prediction represents a grand challenge in computational chemistry due to large sizes of constituent molecules and complex intra- and intermolecular interactions. While generative modeling has revolutionized structure discovery for molecules, inorganic solids, and metal-organic frameworks, extending such approaches to fully periodic molecular crystals is still elusive. Here, we present MolCrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model for molecular crystal structure prediction. The framework disentangles intramolecular complexity from intermolecular packing by embedding molecules as rigid bodies and jointly learning the lattice matrix, molecular orientations, and centroid positions. Centroids and orientations are represented on their native Riemannian manifolds, allowing geodesic flow construction and graph neural network operations that respects geometric symmetries. We benchmark our model against state-of-the-art generative models for large-size periodic crystals and rule-based structure generation methods on two open-source molecular crystal datasets. We demonstrate an integration of MolCrystalFlow model with universal machine learning potential to accelerate molecular crystal structure prediction, paving the way for data-driven generative discovery of molecular crystals.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Edge-Local and Qubit-Efficient Quantum Graph Learning for the NISQ Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16018v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a powerful framework for learning representations from graph-structured data, but their direct implementation on near-term quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit depth, multi-qubit interactions, and qubit scalability constraints. In this work, we introduce a fully quantum graph convolutional architecture designed explicitly for unsupervised learning in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) regime. Our approach combines a variational quantum feature extraction layer with an edge-local and qubit-efficient quantum message-passing mechanism inspired by the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) framework. Unlike prior models that rely on global operations or multi-controlled unitaries, our model decomposes message passing into pairwise interactions along graph edges using only hardware-native single- and two-qubit gates. This design reduces the qubit requirement from $O(Nn)$ to $O(n)$ for a graph with $N$ nodes and $n$-qubit feature registers, enabling implementation on current quantum devices regardless of graph size. We train the model using the Deep Graph Infomax objective to perform unsupervised node representation learning. Experiments on the Cora citation network and a large-scale genomic SNP dataset demonstrate that our model remains competitive with prior quantum and hybrid approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Intrusive Graph-Based Bot Detection for E-Commerce Using Inductive Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22579v6)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malicious bots pose a growing threat to e-commerce platforms by scraping data, hoarding inventory, and perpetrating fraud. Traditional bot mitigation techniques, including IP blacklists and CAPTCHA-based challenges, are increasingly ineffective or intrusive, as modern bots leverage proxies, botnets, and AI-assisted evasion strategies. This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs. The proposed framework is deployment-friendly, integrates with existing systems without client-side instrumentation, and supports real-time inference and incremental updates, making it suitable for practical e-commerce security deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenDA: Generative Data Assimilation on Complex Urban Areas via Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11440v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Code Smell Refactoring Approach using GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12069v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code smell is a great challenge in software refactoring, which indicates latent design or implementation flaws that may degrade the software maintainability and evolution. Over the past decades, a variety of refactoring approaches have been proposed, which can be broadly classified into metrics-based, rule-based, and machine learning-based approaches. Recent years, deep learning-based approaches have also attracted widespread attention. However, existing techniques exhibit various limitations. Metrics- and rule-based approaches rely heavily on manually defined heuristics and thresholds, whereas deep learning-based approaches are often constrained by dataset availability and model design. In this study, we proposed a graph-based deep learning approach for code smell refactoring. Specifically, we designed two types of input graphs (class-level and method-level) and employed both graph classification and node classification tasks to address the refactoring of three representative code smells: long method, large class, and feature envy. In our experiment, we propose a semi-automated dataset generation approach that could generate a large-scale dataset with minimal manual effort. We implemented the proposed approach with three classical GNN (graph neural network) architectures: GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT, and evaluated its performance against both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. The results demonstrate that proposed approach achieves superior refactoring performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond ReLU: Bifurcation, Oversmoothing, and Topological Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15634v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) learn node representations through iterative network-based message-passing. While powerful, deep GNNs suffer from oversmoothing, where node features converge to a homogeneous, non-informative state. We re-frame this problem of representational collapse from a \emph{bifurcation theory} perspective, characterizing oversmoothing as convergence to a stable ``homogeneous fixed point.'' Our central contribution is the theoretical discovery that this undesired stability can be broken by replacing standard monotone activations (e.g., ReLU) with a class of functions. Using Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, we analytically prove that this substitution induces a bifurcation that destabilizes the homogeneous state and creates a new pair of stable, non-homogeneous \emph{patterns} that provably resist oversmoothing. Our theory predicts a precise, nontrivial scaling law for the amplitude of these emergent patterns, which we quantitatively validate in experiments. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our theory by deriving a closed-form, bifurcation-aware initialization and showing its utility in real benchmark experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Geometric Coherence of Global Aggregation in Federated GNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15510v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed training across multiple clients without centralized data sharing, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model relational data through message passing. In federated GNN settings, client graphs often exhibit heterogeneous structural and propagation characteristics. When standard aggregation mechanisms are applied to such heterogeneous updates, the global model may converge numerically while exhibiting degraded relational behavior.Our work identifies a geometric failure mode of global aggregation in Cross- Domain Federated GNNs. Although GNN parameters are numerically represented as vectors, they encode relational transformations that govern the direction, strength, and sensitivity of information flow across graph neighborhoods. Aggregating updates originating from incompatible propagation regimes can therefore introduce destructive interference in this transformation space.This leads to loss of coherence in global message passing. Importantly, this degradation is not necessarily reflected in conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy.To address this issue, we propose GGRS (Global Geometric Reference Structure), a server-side framework that regulates client updates prior to aggregation based on geometric admissibility criteria. GGRS preserves directional consistency of relational transformations as well as maintains diversity of admissible propagation subspaces. It also stabilizes sensitivity to neighborhood interactions, without accessing client data or graph topology. Experiments on heterogeneous GNN-native, Amazon Co-purchase datasets demonstrate that GGRS preserves global message-passing coherence across training rounds by highlighting the necessity of geometry-aware regulation in federated graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a developing preprint of an 18-page journal manuscript (6 figures), currently being prepared for formal peer-review submission</p></details> |
| **[NeuroLifting: Neural Inference on Markov Random Fields at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18954v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference in large-scale Markov Random Fields (MRFs) is a critical yet challenging task, traditionally approached through approximate methods like belief propagation and mean field, or exact methods such as the Toulbar2 solver. These strategies often fail to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and solution quality, particularly as the problem scale increases. This paper introduces NeuroLifting, a novel technique that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to reparameterize decision variables in MRFs, facilitating the use of standard gradient descent optimization. By extending traditional lifting techniques into a non-parametric neural network framework, NeuroLifting benefits from the smooth loss landscape of neural networks, enabling efficient and parallelizable optimization. Empirical results demonstrate that, on moderate scales, NeuroLifting performs very close to the exact solver Toulbar2 in terms of solution quality, significantly surpassing existing approximate methods. Notably, on large-scale MRFs, NeuroLifting delivers superior solution quality against all baselines, as well as exhibiting linear computational complexity growth. This work presents a significant advancement in MRF inference, offering a scalable and effective solution for large-scale problems.</p></details> |  |

A key design choice in GTs is the use of Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based positional encodings to incorporate structural information. In this work, we study GTs through the lens of manifold limit models for graph sequences and establish a theoretical connection between GTs with GNN positional encodings and Manifold Neural Networks (MNNs). Building on transferability results for GNNs under manifold convergence, we show that GTs inherit transferability guarantees from their positional encodings. In particular, GTs trained on small graphs provably generalize to larger graphs under mild assumptions. We complement our theory with extensive experiments on standard graph benchmarks, demonstrating that GTs exhibit scalable behavior on par with GNNs. To further show the efficiency in a real-world scenario, we implement GTs for shortest path distance estimation over terrains to better illustrate the efficiency of the transferable GTs. Our results provide new insights into the understanding of GTs and suggest practical directions for efficient training of GTs in large-scale settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grappa: Gradient-Only Communication for Scalable Graph Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01872v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-partition edges dominate the cost of distributed GNN training: fetching remote features and activations per iteration overwhelms the network as graphs deepen and partition counts grow. Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We present an asymptotically unbiased estimator for gradient correction, which we use to develop a minimum-distance batch-level variant that is compatible with common deep-learning packages. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4x faster on average (up to 13x) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching.</p></details> |  |

Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Wangshuaiia/iQUEST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025), Main Track</p></details> |

The ML-for-combinatorial-optimization community has focused on learning to \emph{replace} solvers, yet recent evidence shows that graph neural networks (GNNs) rarely outperform well-tuned classical methods on standard benchmarks. We pursue a different objective: learning to predict \emph{when} a given instance is hard for greedy allocation, enabling instance-dependent algorithm selection. We design a 20-dimensional structural feature vector and train a lightweight MLP hardness classifier that predicts the greedy optimality gap with mean absolute error 0.033, Pearson correlation 0.937, and binary classification accuracy 94.7\% across three random seeds. For instances identified as hard -- those exhibiting ``whale-fish'' trap structure where greedy provably fails -- we deploy a heterogeneous GNN specialist that achieves ${\approx}0\%$ optimality gap on all six adversarial configurations tested (vs.\ 3.75--59.24\% for greedy). A hybrid allocator combining the hardness classifier with GNN and greedy solvers achieves 0.51\% overall gap on mixed distributions. Our honest evaluation on CATS benchmarks confirms that GNNs do not outperform Gurobi (0.45--0.71 vs.\ 0.20 gap), motivating the algorithm selection framing. Learning \emph{when} to deploy expensive solvers is more tractable than learning to replace them.</p></details> |  |

Finding genuine matter underdensities in sparse galaxy surveys is, however, an underconstrained problem. Traditional void finding algorithms produce deterministic void catalogs, neglecting the probabilistic nature of the problem. We present a method to sample from the stochastic mapping from galaxy catalogs to arbitrary void definitions. Our algorithm uses a deep graph neural network to evolve "test particles" according to a flow-matching objective. We demonstrate the method in a simplified example setting but outline steps to generalize it towards practically usable void finders. Trained on a deterministic teacher, the model performs well but has considerable stochasticity which we interpret as regularization. Cosmological information in the predicted void catalogs outperforms the teacher. On the one hand, our method can cheaply emulate existing void finders with apparently useful regularization. More importantly, it also allows us to find the Bayes-optimal mapping between observed galaxies and any void definition. This includes definitions operating at the level of simulated matter density and velocity fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+3 p...</summary><p>8+3 pages, 9+2 figures.

Distilling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g., common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average 7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction method.

| **[Whom to Query for What: Adaptive Group Elicitation via Multi-Turn LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14279v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Eliciting information to reduce uncertainty about latent group-level properties from surveys and other collective assessments requires allocating limited questioning effort under real costs and missing data. Although large language models enable adaptive, multi-turn interactions in natural language, most existing elicitation methods optimize what to ask with a fixed respondent pool, and do not adapt respondent selection or leverage population structure when responses are partial or incomplete. To address this gap, we study adaptive group elicitation, a multi-round setting where an agent adaptively selects both questions and respondents under explicit query and participation budgets. We propose a theoretically grounded framework that combines (i) an LLM-based expected information gain objective for scoring candidate questions with (ii) heterogeneous graph neural network propagation that aggregates observed responses and participant attributes to impute missing responses and guide per-round respondent selection. This closed-loop procedure queries a small, informative subset of individuals while inferring population-level responses via structured similarity. Across three real-world opinion datasets, our method consistently improves population-level response prediction under constrained budgets, including a >12% relative gain on CES at a 10% respondent budget.</p></details> |  |

Conventional heuristic methods and deep learning models, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically designed for static graphs and thus struggle to capture temporal dependencies. Snapshot-based techniques partially address this issue but often encounter data sparsity and class imbalance, particularly in networks with transient interactions such as telecommunication call detail records (CDRs). Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) model dynamic graphs by updating node embeddings over time; however, their predictive accuracy under sparse conditions remains limited. In this study, we improve the TGN framework by extracting enclosing subgraphs around candidate links, enabling the model to jointly learn structural and temporal information. Experiments on a sparse CDR dataset show that our approach increases average precision by 2.6% over standard TGNs, demonstrating the advantages of integrating local topology for robust link prediction in dynamic networks.</p></details> |  |

These graphs provide a hierarchical metric-semantic representation in which such concepts are organized. To further enhance graph-SLAM performance, Factorized 3D Scene Graphs incorporate these concepts as optimization factors that constrain relative geometry and enforce global consistency. However, both stages of this process remain largely manual: concepts are typically derived using hand-crafted, concept-specific heuristics, while factors and their covariances are likewise manually designed. This reliance on manual specification limits generalization across diverse environments and scalability to new concept classes. This paper presents a novel learning-based method that infers spatial concepts online from observed vertical planes and introduces them as optimizable factors within a SLAM backend, eliminating the need to handcraft concept generation, factor design, and covariance specification. We evaluate our approach in simulated environments with complex layouts, improving room detection by 20.7% and trajectory estimation by 19.2%, and further validate it on real construction sites, where room detection improves by 5.3% and map matching accuracy by 3.8%. Results confirm that learned factors can improve their handcrafted counterparts in SLAM systems and serve as a foundation for extending this approach to new spatial concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

Standard Large Language Modles (LLMs) are often unsuitable for this task due to context window limitations that prevent them from processing entire code repositories. As a result, various retrieval methods are commonly used, including keyword matching, text similarity, and simple graph-based heuristics such as Breadth-First Search. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising alternative due to their ability to model complex, repository-wide dependencies; however, their application has been hindered by the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce GREPO, the first GNN benchmark for repository-scale bug localization tasks. GREPO comprises 86 Python repositories and 47294 bug-fixing tasks, providing graph-based data structures ready for direct GNN processing. Our evaluation of various GNN architectures shows outstanding performance compared to established information retrieval baselines.

This approach limits the scalability and generalizability of GNNs, as models must be tailored for each specific graph type. To address these challenges, we introduce GraphFM, a scalable multi-graph pretraining approach designed for learning across diverse graph datasets. GraphFM uses a Perceiver-based encoder with learned latent tokens to compress domain-specific features into a shared latent space, enabling generalization across graph domains. We propose new techniques for scaling up graph training on datasets of different sizes, allowing us to train GraphFM on 152 distinct graph datasets, containing a total of 7.4 million nodes and 189 million edges. This allows us to study the effect of scale on pretraining across domains such as molecules, citation networks, and product graphs, and show that training on diverse datasets improves performance over single-source pretraining. Additionally, pretraining with a mixture of synthetic and real graphs enhances adaptability and stability, leading to competitive performance with state-of-the-art models across various node classification tasks. This approach reduces the burden of dataset-specific training and provides a single generalist model capable of performing across multiple diverse graph structures and tasks.

In this work, we introduce a new application for GNNs in the physical sciences: instrumentation design. As a case study, we apply GNNs to simulate models of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and show that they are capable of accurately capturing the complex optical physics at play, while achieving runtimes 815 times faster than state of the art simulation packages. We discuss the unique challenges this problem provides for machine learning models.

| **[Optimization-Free Graph Embedding via Distributional Kernel for Community Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13634v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neighborhood Aggregation Strategy (NAS) is a widely used approach in graph embedding, underpinning both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) methods. However, NAS-based methods are identified to be prone to over-smoothing-the loss of node distinguishability with increased iterations-thereby limiting their effectiveness. This paper identifies two characteristics in a network, i.e., the distributions of nodes and node degrees that are critical for expressive representation but have been overlooked in existing methods. We show that these overlooked characteristics contribute significantly to over-smoothing of NAS-methods. To address this, we propose a novel weighted distribution-aware kernel that embeds nodes while taking their distributional characteristics into consideration. Our method has three distinguishing features: (1) it is the first method to explicitly incorporate both distributional characteristics; (2) it requires no optimization; and (3) it effectively mitigates the adverse effects of over-smoothing, allowing WL to preserve node distinguishability and expressiveness even after many iterations of embedding. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior community detection performance via spectral clustering, outperforming existing graph embedding methods, including deep learning methods, on standard benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Approximate Uniform Facility Location via Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13155v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in using neural networks, especially message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems heuristically. However, existing learning-based approaches for hard combinatorial optimization tasks often rely on supervised training data, reinforcement learning, or gradient estimators, leading to significant computational overhead, unstable training, or a lack of provable performance guarantees. In contrast, classical approximation algorithms offer such performance guarantees under worst-case inputs but are non-differentiable and unable to adaptively exploit structural regularities in natural input distributions. We address this dichotomy with the fundamental example of Uniform Facility Location (UniFL), a variant of the combinatorial facility location problem with applications in clustering, data summarization, logistics, and supply chain design. We develop a fully differentiable MPNN model that embeds approximation-algorithmic principles while avoiding the need for solver supervision or discrete relaxations. Our approach admits provable approximation and size generalization guarantees to much larger instances than seen during training. Empirically, we show that our approach outperforms standard non-learned approximation algorithms in terms of solution quality, closing the gap with computationally intensive integer linear programming approaches. Overall, this work provides a step toward bridging learning-based methods and approximation algorithms for discrete optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlashSchNet: Fast and Accurate Coarse-Grained Neural Network Molecular Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13140v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network (GNN) potentials such as SchNet improve the accuracy and transferability of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation by learning many-body interactions, but remain slower than classical force fields due to fragmented kernels and memory-bound pipelines that underutilize GPUs. We show that a missing principle is making GNN-MD IO-aware, carefully accounting for reads and writes between GPU high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. We present FlashSchNet, an efficient and accurate IO-aware SchNet-style GNN-MD framework built on four techniques: (1) flash radial basis, which fuses pairwise distance computation, Gaussian basis expansion, and cosine envelope into a single tiled pass, computing each distance once and reusing it across all basis functions; (2) flash message passing, which fuses cutoff, neighbor gather, filter multiplication, and reduction to avoid materializing edge tensors in HBM; (3) flash aggregation, which reformulates scatter-add via CSR segment reduce, reducing atomic writes by a factor of feature dimension and enabling contention-free accumulation in both forward and backward passes; (4) channel-wise 16-bit quantization that exploits the low per-channel dynamic range in SchNet MLP weights to further improve throughput with negligible accuracy loss. On a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000, FlashSchNet achieves 1000 ns/day aggregate simulation throughput over 64 parallel replicas on coarse-grained (CG) protein containing 269 beads (6.5x faster than CGSchNet baseline with 80% reduction of peak memory), surpassing classical force fields (e.g. MARTINI) while retaining SchNet-level accuracy and transferability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/flash-molecular-dynamics</p></details> |
| **[Which Algorithms Can Graph Neural Networks Learn?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13106v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding neural architectures' ability to learn to execute discrete algorithms, a line of work often referred to as neural algorithmic reasoning. The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss. Empirical results largely support our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) have shown promise in mitigating class imbalance with numeric interpolation; however, existing approaches largely rely on embedding-space arithmetic, which fails to capture the rich semantics inherent in text-attributed graphs. In this work, we propose our method, SaVe-TAG (Semantic-aware Vicinal Risk Minimization for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs), a novel VRM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform text-level interpolation, generating on-manifold, boundary-enriching synthetic samples for minority classes. To mitigate the risk of noisy generation, we introduce a confidence-based edge assignment mechanism that uses graph topology as a natural filter to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical justification for our method and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing that our approach consistently outperforms both numeric interpolation and prior long-tailed node classification baselines. Our results highlight the importance of integrating semantic and structural signals for balanced and effective learning on text-attributed graphs.

However, existing TGNNs primarily target one-time predictions for a given temporal span, whereas many practical applications require continuous predictions, that predictions are issued frequently over time. Directly adapting existing TGNNs to continuous-prediction scenarios introduces either significant computational overhead or prediction quality issues especially for large graphs. This paper revisits the challenge of { continuous predictions} in TGNNs, and introduces {\sc Coden}, a TGNN model designed for efficient and effective learning on dynamic graphs. {\sc Coden} innovatively overcomes the key complexity bottleneck in existing TGNNs while preserving comparable predictive accuracy. Moreover, we further provide theoretical analyses that substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of {\sc Coden}, and clarify its duality relationship with both RNN-based and attention-based models. Our evaluations across five dynamic datasets show that {\sc Coden} surpasses existing performance benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness, establishing it as a superior solution for continuous prediction in evolving graph environments.</p></details> |  |

Despite existing applications of deep learning in land use monitoring, standard convolutional kernels in deep neural networks limit the applications of these networks to the Euclidean domain only. Considering the geodesic nature of the measurement of the earth's surface, remote sensing is one such area that can benefit from non-Euclidean and spherical domains. For this purpose, we designed a novel Graph Neural Network architecture for spatial and spatio-temporal classification using satellite imagery to acquire insights into socio-economic indicators. We propose a hybrid attention method to learn the relative importance of irregular neighbors in remote sensing data. Instead of classifying each pixel, we propose a method based on Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) image segmentation and Graph Attention Network. The superpixels obtained from SLIC become the nodes of our Graph Convolution Network (GCN). A region adjacency graph (RAG) is then constructed where each superpixel is connected to every other adjacent superpixel in the image, enabling information to propagate globally. Finally, we propose a Spatially driven Attention Graph Neural Network (SAG-NN) to classify each RAG. We also propose an extension to our SAG-NN for spatio-temporal data. Unlike regular grids of pixels in images, superpixels are irregular in nature and cannot be used to create spatio-temporal graphs. We introduce temporal bias by combining unconnected RAGs from each image into one supergraph. This is achieved by introducing block adjacency matrices resulting in novel Spatio-Temporal driven Attention Graph Neural Network with Block Adjacency matrix (STAG-NN-BA). SAG-NN and STAG-NN-BA outperform graph and non-graph baselines on Asia14 and C2D2 datasets efficiently.</p></details> |  |

Despite its importance, finding the most frequent induced subgraph remains computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the subgraph counting task. Traditional exact enumeration algorithms often suffer from high time complexity, especially for a large graph size $k$. To mitigate this, existing approaches often utilize frequency measurement with the Downward Closure Property to reduce the search space, imposing additional constraints on the task. In this paper, we first formulate this task as a Markov Decision Process and approach it using a multi-task reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we introduce RLMiner, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with our proposed task-state-aware Graph Neural Network to find the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ with a time complexity linear to $k$. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed RLMiner effectively identifies subgraphs with frequencies closely matching the ground-truth most frequent induced subgraphs, while achieving significantly shorter and more stable running times compared to traditional methods.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that such networks are effective on synthetic point cloud data, as well as on real-world data derived from wind-field measurements and neural activity data. Theoretically, we prove that these new wavelets have desirable frame theoretic properties, similar to traditional diffusion wavelets. Additionally, we prove that these wavelets have desirable symmetries with respect to rotations and translations.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A previous, shorter version of this work was presented in the workshop "New Perspectives in Advancing Graph Machine Learning" at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[ATLAS: Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14908v5)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on homophilic graphs where connected nodes share labels, but struggle with heterophilic graphs where edges do not imply similarity. Moreover, iterative message passing limits scalability due to neighborhood expansion overhead. We introduce ATLAS (Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale), a propagation-free framework that encodes graph structure through multi-resolution community features rather than message passing. We first prove that community refinement involves a fundamental trade-off: finer partitions increase label-community mutual information but also increase entropy. We formalize when refinement improves normalized mutual information, explaining why intermediate granularities are often most predictive. ATLAS employs modularity-guided adaptive search to automatically identify informative community scales, which are one-hot encoded, projected into learnable embeddings, and concatenated with node attributes for MLP classification. This enables standard mini-batch training and adjacency-free inference after one-time preprocessing. Across 13 benchmarks including million-node graphs, ATLAS achieves competitive or superior accuracy, up to 20-point gains over GCN on heterophilic datasets and 12-point gains over MLPs on homophilic graphs. By treating topology as explicit features, ATLAS adapts intelligently: leveraging structure when informative, remaining robust when weakly aligned, and avoiding propagation when structure misleads, providing both scalable performance and interpretable structural insights.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Bayesian Neighborhood Adaptation for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05358v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The neighborhood scope (i.e., number of hops) where graph neural networks (GNNs) aggregate information to characterize a node's statistical property is critical to GNNs' performance. Two-stage approaches, training and validating GNNs for every pre-specified neighborhood scope to search for the best setting, is a time-consuming task and tends to be biased due to the search space design. How to adaptively determine proper neighborhood scopes for the aggregation process for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs remains largely unexplored. We thus propose to model the GNNs' message-passing behavior on a graph as a stochastic process by treating the number of hops as a beta process. This Bayesian framework allows us to infer the most plausible neighborhood scope for message aggregation simultaneously with the optimization of GNN parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that the scope inference improves the expressivity of a GNN. Experiments on benchmark homophilic and heterophilic datasets show that the proposed method is compatible with state-of-the-art GNN variants, achieving competitive or superior performance on the node classification task, and providing well-calibrated predictions.

| **[Community Concealment from Unsupervised Graph Learning-Based Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12250v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to use attributed graphs to learn representations. Such representations are beneficial in the unsupervised learning of clusters and community detection. Nonetheless, such inference may reveal sensitive groups, clustered systems, or collective behaviors, raising concerns regarding group-level privacy. Community attribution in social and critical infrastructure networks, for example, can expose coordinated asset groups, operational hierarchies, and system dependencies that could be used for profiling or intelligence gathering. We study a defensive setting in which a data publisher (defender) seeks to conceal a community of interest while making limited, utility-aware changes in the network. Our analysis indicates that community concealment is strongly influenced by two quantifiable factors: connectivity at the community boundary and feature similarity between the protected community and adjacent communities. Informed by these findings, we present a perturbation strategy that rewires a set of selected edges and modifies node features to reduce the distinctiveness leveraged by GNN message passing. The proposed method outperforms DICE in our experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real network graphs under identical perturbation budgets. Overall, it achieves median relative concealment improvements of approximately 20-45% across the evaluated settings. These findings demonstrate a mitigation strategy against GNN-based community learning and highlight group-level privacy risks intrinsic to graph learning.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces RokomariBG, a large-scale, multi-entity heterogeneous book graph dataset designed to support research on personalized recommendation in a low-resource language setting. The dataset comprises 127,302 books, 63,723 users, 16,601 authors, 1,515 categories, 2,757 publishers, and 209,602 reviews, connected through eight relation types and organized as a comprehensive knowledge graph. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we provide a systematic benchmarking study on the Top-N recommendation task, evaluating a diverse set of representative recommendation models, including classical collaborative filtering methods, matrix factorization models, content-based approaches, graph neural networks, a hybrid matrix factorization model with side information, and a neural two-tower retrieval architecture. The benchmarking results highlight the importance of leveraging multi-relational structure and textual side information, with neural retrieval models achieving the strongest performance (NDCG@10 = 0.204). Overall, this work establishes a foundational benchmark and a publicly available resource for Bangla book recommendation research, enabling reproducible evaluation and future studies on recommendation in low-resource cultural domains.

| **[Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13062v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over graph-structured data, yet recent studies have shown that their performance gains are beginning to plateau. In many cases, well-established models such as GCN and GAT, when appropriately tuned, can match or even exceed the performance of more complex, state-of-the-art architectures. This trend highlights a key limitation in the current landscape: the difficulty of selecting the most suitable model for a given graph task or dataset. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models (SAGMM), a modular and practical framework that learns to automatically select and combine the most appropriate GNN models from a diverse pool of architectures. Unlike prior mixture-of-experts approaches that rely on variations of a single base model, SAGMM leverages architectural diversity and a topology-aware attention gating mechanism to adaptively assign experts to each node based on the structure of the input graph. To improve efficiency, SAGMM includes a pruning mechanism that reduces the number of active experts during training and inference without compromising performance. We also explore a training-efficient variant in which expert models are pretrained and frozen, and only the gating and task-specific layers are trained. We evaluate SAGMM on 16 benchmark datasets covering node classification, graph classification, regression, and link prediction tasks, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms or matches leading GNN baselines and prior mixture-based methods, offering a robust and adaptive solution for real-world graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[GP2F: Cross-Domain Graph Prompting with Adaptive Fusion of Pre-trained Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11629v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for downstream adaptation of pre-trained graph models, mitigating the misalignment between pre-training objectives and downstream tasks. Recently, the focus of GPL has shifted from in-domain to cross-domain scenarios, which is closer to the real world applications, where the pre-training source and downstream target often differ substantially in data distribution. However, why GPLs remain effective under such domain shifts is still unexplored. Empirically, we observe that representative GPL methods are competitive with two simple baselines in cross-domain settings: full fine-tuning (FT) and linear probing (LP), motivating us to explore a deeper understanding of the prompting mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that jointly leveraging these two complementary branches yields a smaller estimation error than using either branch alone, formally proving that cross-domain GPL benefits from the integration between pre-trained knowledge and task-specific adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose GP2F, a dual-branch GPL method that explicitly instantiates the two extremes: (1) a frozen branch that retains pre-trained knowledge, and (2) an adapted branch with lightweight adapters for task-specific adaptation. We then perform adaptive fusion under topology constraints via a contrastive loss and a topology-consistent loss. Extensive experiments on cross-domain few-shot node and graph classification demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

Existing methods either focus on pixel-level fusion while overlooking downstream task adaptability or implicitly learn rigid semantics through cascaded detection/segmentation models, unable to interactively address diverse semantic target perception needs. We propose CtrlFuse, a controllable image fusion framework that enables interactive dynamic fusion guided by mask prompts. The model integrates a multi-modal feature extractor, a reference prompt encoder (RPE), and a prompt-semantic fusion module (PSFM). The RPE dynamically encodes task-specific semantic prompts by fine-tuning pre-trained segmentation models with input mask guidance, while the PSFM explicitly injects these semantics into fusion features. Through synergistic optimization of parallel segmentation and fusion branches, our method achieves mutual enhancement between task performance and fusion quality. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in both fusion controllability and segmentation accuracy, with the adapted task branch even outperforming the original segmentation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages,22 figures,published to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

This paper presents MPBS (Mobility-aware Prediction and Behavior-based Scheduling), a scalable task recruitment framework that treats each device as a recruitable "user". MPBS integrates three key modules: a behavior-aware KNN classifier, a time-varying Markov prediction model for forecasting device mobility, and a dynamic priority scheduling mechanism that considers task urgency and base station performance. By combining behavioral classification with spatiotemporal prediction, MPBS adaptively assigns tasks to the most suitable devices in real time. Experimental evaluations on the real-world GeoLife dataset show that MPBS significantly improves task completion efficiency and resource utilization. The proposed framework offers a predictive, behavior-aware solution for intelligent and collaborative scheduling in unmanned systems.</p></details> |  |

However, as the number of agents and task targets increases, existing optimization-based methods often incur prohibitive computational costs, posing significant challenges to large-scale coordination in unmanned systems. To address this issue, this paper proposes a K-means-inspired task allocation framework that reformulates the MTSP as a spatially constrained classification process. By leveraging spatial coherence, the proposed method enables fast estimation of path costs and efficient task grouping, thereby fundamentally reducing overall computational complexity. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the framework can maintain high solution quality even in extremely large-scale scenarios-for instance, in tasks involving 1000 agents and 5000 targets. The findings indicate that this "cluster-then-route" decomposition strategy offers an efficient and reliable solution for large-scale multi-agent task allocation.</p></details> |  |

Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched because of its low-cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges of poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded systems.

It can accurately estimate depth maps on embedded systems and significantly improves boundary quality. Firstly, we design an Enhanced Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (EFAF) which adaptively fuses depth features to enhance boundary detail representation. Secondly, we integrate semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve the object recognition and boundary perception capabilities. Finally, BoRe-Depth is deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, and runs efficiently at 50.7 FPS. We demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous lightweight models on multiple challenging datasets, and we provide detailed ablation studies for the proposed methods.

Existing underwater diver communication methods face hurdles due to inherent disadvantages and complex underwater environments. To address this issue, we propose a scheme that utilizes maritime unmanned systems to assist divers with reliable and high-speed communication. Multiple AUVs are equipped with optical and acoustic multimodal communication devices as relay nodes, providing adaptive communication services based on changes in the diver's activity area. By using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to control the cooperative movement of AUVs, high-speed and reliable data transmission between divers can be achieved. At the same time, utilizing the advantages of on-demand deployment and wide coverage of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) as surface relay nodes to coordinate and forward information from AUVs, and controlling AUVs to adaptively select relay USV nodes for data transmission, high-quality communication between divers and surface platform can be achieved.

Today's complex environments demand PNT that is more resilient, energy-efficient and cognitively capable.

However, limited communication bandwidth and the need for high-frequency interactions pose severe challenges to semantic information transmission within the swarm. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM-driven UAV swarms for autonomous semantic compression communication, aiming to reduce communication load while preserving critical task semantics. To this end, we construct four types of 2D simulation scenarios with different levels of environmental complexity and design a communication-execution pipeline that integrates system prompts with task instruction prompts. On this basis, we systematically evaluate the semantic compression performance of nine mainstream LLMs in different scenarios and analyze their adaptability and stability through ablation studies on environmental complexity and swarm size. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-based UAV swarms have the potential to achieve efficient collaborative communication under bandwidth-constrained and multi-hop link conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce MorphEUS, a morphable co-axial quadrotor that can control position and orientation independently with high efficiency. It uses a paired servo motor mechanism for each rotor arm, capable of pointing the vectored-thrust in any arbitrary direction. As compared to the \textit{state-of-the-art} OMAVs, we achieve higher and more uniform force/torque reachability with a smaller footprint and minimum thrust cancellations. The overactuated nature of the system also results in resiliency to rotor or servo-motor failures. The capabilities of this quadrotor are particularly well-suited for contact-based infrastructure inspection and close-proximity imaging of complex geometries. In the accompanying control pipeline, we present theoretical results for full controllability, almost-everywhere exponential stability, and thrust-energy optimality. We evaluate our design and controller on high-fidelity simulations showcasing the trajectory-tracking capabilities of the vehicle during various tasks. Supplementary details and experimental videos are available on the project webpage.</p></details> |  |

Today, heterogeneous air-ground collaborative multi-agent framework, which comprise unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), have presented superior flexibility and efficiency compared to traditional homogeneous frameworks in complex sensing tasks. Within this context, task allocation among different agents always play an important role in improving overall MCS quality. In order to better allocate tasks among heterogeneous collaborative agents, in this paper, we investigated two representative complex multi-agent task allocation scenarios with dual optimization objectives: (1) For AG-FAMT (Air-Ground Few Agents More Tasks) scenario, the objectives are to maximize the task completion while minimizing the total travel distance; (2) For AG-MAFT (Air-Ground More Agents Few Tasks) scenario, where the agents are allocated based on their locations, has the optimization objectives of minimizing the total travel distance while reducing travel time cost. To achieve this, we proposed a Multi-Task Minimum Cost Maximum Flow (MT-MCMF) optimization algorithm tailored for AG-FAMT, along with a multi-objective optimization algorithm called W-ILP designed for AG-MAFT, with a particular focus on optimizing the charging path planning of UAVs. Our experiments based on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrated that the proposed two algorithms both outperform baseline approaches under varying experimental settings, including task quantity, task difficulty, and task distribution, providing a novel way to improve the overall quality of mobile crowdsensing tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing unmanned systems often rely on GPS-based navigation, which is prone to inaccuracies in rural areas and limits flight paths to predefined routes, resulting in operational inefficiencies. To address these challenges, this paper presents ForaNav, an insect-inspired navigation strategy for autonomous navigation in plantations. The proposed method employs an enhanced Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG)-based tree detection approach, integrating hue-saturation histograms and global HOG feature variance with hierarchical HOG extraction to distinguish oil palm trees from visually similar objects. Inspired by insect foraging behavior, the MAV dynamically adjusts its path based on detected trees and employs a recovery mechanism to stay on course if a target is temporarily lost. We demonstrate that our detection method generalizes well to different tree types while maintaining lower CPU usage, lower temperature, and higher FPS than lightweight deep learning models, making it well-suited for real-time applications. Flight test results across diverse real-world scenarios show that the MAV successfully detects and approaches all trees without prior tree location, validating its effectiveness for agricultural automation.</p></details> |  |

Recently, infrared sensors have been widely deployed on mobile and stationary platforms for detection and classification of objects from long distances and in wide field of views. Given its success in the vision image analysis domain, deep learning has also been applied for object recognition in infrared images. However, techniques that have proven successful in visible light perception face new challenges in the infrared domain. These challenges include extremely low signal-to-noise ratios in infrared images, very small and blurred objects of interest, and limited availability of labeled/unlabeled training data due to the specialized nature of infrared sensors. Numerous methods have been proposed in the literature for the detection and classification of small objects in infrared images achieving varied levels of success. There is a need for a survey paper that critically analyzes existing techniques in this domain, identifies unsolved challenges and provides future research directions. This paper fills the gap and offers a concise and insightful review of deep learning-based methods. It also identifies the challenges faced by existing infrared object segmentation methods and provides a structured review of existing infrared perception methods from the perspective of these challenges and highlights the motivations behind the various approaches.

Current SLAM systems can achieve centimeter-level accuracy within a short period. However, there are still several challenges when dealing with largescale mapping tasks including significant storage requirements and difficulty of reusing the constructed maps. To address this, we first design an elastic and lightweight map representation called CELLmap, composed of several CELLs, each representing the local map at the corresponding location. Then, we design a general backend including CELL-based bidirectional registration module and loop closure detection module to improve global map consistency. Our experiments have demonstrated that CELLmap can represent the precise geometric structure of large-scale maps of KITTI dataset using only about 60 MB. Additionally, our general backend achieves up to a 26.88% improvement over various LiDAR odometry methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Over the last 55 years, Singapore has become an established purchaser of U.S. defense technology, but the past 20 years have also seen the U.S.-Singapore relationship mature into an increasingly collaborative one, tackling newer fields like cybersecurity and biosecurity. However, current geopolitical tensions present a challenge for Singapore, which strives to retain its strategic autonomy by maintaining positive relations with all parties. Paradoxically, the rise of non-traditional security threats may pave the way for greater bilateral cooperation by allowing Singapore to position itself as a hub for cooperation on regional security issues in Southeast Asia at large. In such spirit, this paper recommends that the United States and Singapore do the following: 1) in defense technology, co-develop niche capabilities in C4ISR and unmanned systems with peacetime applications; 2) in cybersecurity, improve their domestic resilience against sophisticated nation-state actors while also building regional capacity to counter cybercrime in Southeast Asia; and 3) in biosecurity, strengthen regional epidemiological surveillance to brace against possible future pandemics.</p></details> | 11 pages |

On one hand, big robotics companies offer training programs based on the job requirements. However, these training programs may not be as beneficial as general robotics programs offered by universities or community colleges. On the other hand, community colleges and universities face challenges with required resources, especially qualified instructors, to offer students advanced robotics education. Furthermore, the diverse backgrounds of undergraduate students present additional challenges. Some students bring extensive industry experiences, while others are newcomers to the field. To address these challenges, we propose a student-centered personalized learning framework for robotics. This framework allows a general instructor to teach undergraduate-level robotics courses by breaking down course topics into smaller components with well-defined topic dependencies, structured as a graph. This modular approach enables students to choose their learning path, catering to their unique preferences and pace. Moreover, our framework's flexibility allows for easy customization of teaching materials to meet the specific needs of host institutions. In addition to teaching materials, a frequently-asked-questions document would be prepared for a general instructor. If students' robotics questions cannot be answered by the instructor, the answers to these questions may be included in this document. For questions not covered in this document, we can gather and address them through collaboration with the robotics community and course content creators. Our user study results demonstrate the promise of this method in delivering undergraduate-level robotics education tailored to individual learning outcomes and preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, 2024 ASEE Conference</p></details> |

However, implementing CP still faces key challenges due to the characteristics of the CP task and the dynamics of wireless channels. In this article, a task-oriented wireless communication framework is proposed to jointly optimize the communication scheme and the CP procedure. We first propose channel-adaptive compression and robust fusion approaches to extract and exploit the most valuable semantic information under wireless communication constraints. We then propose a task-oriented distributed scheduling algorithm to identify the best collaborators for CP under dynamic environments. The main idea is learning while scheduling, where the collaboration utility is effectively learned with low computation and communication overhead. Case studies are carried out in connected autonomous driving scenarios to verify the proposed framework.

Specifically, we firstly explore the recent technical developments of NS-COM, followed by the discussions about motivations behind integrating NS-COM into SAGSIN. To further demonstrate the necessity of NS-COM, a comparative analysis between the NS-COM network and other counterparts in SAGSIN is conducted, covering aspects of deployment, coverage, channel characteristics and unique problems of NS-COM network. Afterwards, the technical aspects of NS-COM, including channel modeling, random access, channel estimation, array-based beam management and joint network optimization, are examined in detail. Furthermore, we explore the potential applications of NS-COM, such as structural expansion in SAGSIN communication, civil aviation communication, remote and urgent communication, weather monitoring and carbon neutrality. Finally, some promising research avenues are identified, including stratospheric satellite (StratoSat) -to-ground direct links for mobile terminals, reconfigurable multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and holographic MIMO, federated learning in NS-COM networks, maritime communication, electromagnetic spectrum sensing and adversarial game, integrated sensing and communications, StratoSat-based radar detection and imaging, NS-COM assisted enhanced global navigation system, NS-COM assisted intelligent unmanned system and free space optical (FSO) communication.

In particular, the DGVF controller provides a hierarchical architecture of an upper-level heterogeneous guidance velocity controller and a lower-level signal tracking regulator. Therein, the upper-level controller is to govern multiple heterogeneous USVs and UAVs to approach and maneuver along the prescribed paths and coordinate the formation simultaneously, whereas the low-level regulator is to track the corresponding desired guidance signals provided by the upper-level module. Significantly, the heterogeneous coordination among neighboring UAVs and USVs is achieved merely by the lightweight communication of a scalar (i.e., the additional virtual coordinate), which substantially decreases the communication and computational costs. Sufficient conditions assuring asymptotical convergence of the closed-loop system are derived in presence of the exponentially vanishing tracking errors. Finally, real-lake experiments are conducted on a self-established cross-domain heterogeneous platform consisting of three M-100 UAVs, two HUSTER-16 USVs, a HUSTER-12C USV, and a WiFi 5G wireless communication station to verify the effectiveness of the present DGVF controller.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, many existing Simultaneous Localization, Mapping and Moving Object Tracking (SLAMMOT) methods focus solely on estimating specific object poses and lack estimation of object scales and are unable to effectively track unknown objects. In this paper, we propose a novel SLAM backend that unifies ego-motion tracking, rigid object motion tracking, and modeling within a joint optimization framework. In the perception part, we designed a pixel-level asynchronous object tracker (AOT) based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and DeAOT, enabling the tracker to effectively track target unknown objects guided by various predefined tasks and prompts. In the modeling part, we present a novel object-centric quadric parameterization to unify both static and dynamic object initialization and optimization. Subsequently, in the part of object state estimation, we propose a tightly coupled optimization model for object pose and scale estimation, incorporating hybrids constraints into a novel dual sliding window optimization framework for joint estimation. To our knowledge, we are the first to tightly couple object pose tracking with light-weight modeling of dynamic and static objects using quadric. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on simulation datasets and real-world datasets, demonstrating the state-of-the-art robustness and accuracy in motion estimation and modeling. Our system showcases the potential application of object perception in complex dynamic scenes.</p></details> |  |

Unlike general-purpose systems, unmanned systems cannot deploy complete security protection schemes, due to their limitations in size, cost and performance. MCAs in unmanned systems are particularly difficult to defend against. Furthermore, MCAs have diverse and unpredictable attack interfaces in unmanned systems, severely impacting digital and physical sectors. In this paper, we first generalize, model and taxonomize MCAs found in unmanned systems currently, laying the foundation for designing a portable and general defense approach. According to different attack mechanisms, we found that MCAs are mainly categorized into two types--return2libc and return2shellcode. To tackle return2libc attacks, we model the erratic operation of unmanned systems with cycles and then propose a cycle-task-oriented memory protection (CToMP) approach to protect control flows from tampering. To defend against return2shellcode attacks, we introduce a secure process stack with a randomized memory address by leveraging the memory pool to prevent Shellcode from being executed. Moreover, we discuss the mechanism by which CToMP resists the ROP attack, a novel variant of return2libc attacks. Finally, we implement CToMP on CUAV V5+ with Ardupilot and Crazyflie. The evaluation and security analysis results demonstrate that the proposed approach CToMP is resilient to various MCAs in unmanned systems with low footprints and system overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a method that identifies obstacles in terms of ellipsoids to estimate linear and angular obstacle velocities. Our proposed method is based on the idea of any object can be approximately expressed by ellipsoids. To achieve this, we propose a method based on variational Bayesian estimation of Gaussian mixture model, the Kyachiyan algorithm, and a refinement algorithm. Our proposed method does not require knowledge of the number of clusters and can operate in real-time, unlike existing optimization-based methods. In addition, we define an ellipsoid-based feature vector to match obstacles given two timely close point frames. Our method can be applied to any environment with static and dynamic obstacles, including the ones with rotating obstacles.

In modern operational environments, all job plans are affected by emergency events such as equipment failures and resource shortages, making a quick resolution critical. The use of unmanned systems to assist decision-making can improve resolution efficiency, but their decision-making is not interpretable and may make the wrong decisions. Current unmanned systems require human supervision and control. Based on this, we propose a collaborative human--machine method for resolving unplanned events using two phases: task filtering and task scheduling. In the task filtering phase, we propose a human--machine collaborative decision-making algorithm for dynamic tasks. The GACRNN model is used to predict the state of the job nodes, locate the key nodes, and generate a machine-predicted resolution task list. A human decision-maker supervises the list in real time and modifies and confirms the machine-predicted list through the human--machine interface. In the task scheduling phase, we propose a scheduling algorithm that integrates human experience constraints. The steps to resolve an event are inserted into the normal job sequence to schedule the resolution. We propose several human--machine collaboration methods in each phase to generate steps to resolve an unplanned event while minimizing the impact on the original job plan.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |

However, due to the complexity of unmanned warehouse systems and their susceptibility to errors, incidents may occur during their operation, most often in inbound and outbound operations, which can decrease operational efficiency. Hence it is crucial to to improve the response to such incidents. This paper proposes a collaborative optimization algorithm for emergent incident response based on Safe-MADDPG. To meet safety requirements during emergent incident response, we investigated the intrinsic hidden relationships between various factors. By obtaining constraint information of agents during the emergent incident response process and of the dynamic environment of unmanned warehouses on agents, the algorithm reduces safety risks and avoids the occurrence of chain accidents; this enables an unmanned system to complete emergent incident response tasks and achieve its optimization objectives: (1) minimizing the losses caused by emergent incidents; and (2) maximizing the operational efficiency of inbound and outbound operations during the response process. A series of experiments conducted in a simulated unmanned warehouse scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

Through empirical analysis, infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) enables hard-to-find objects apparent, whereas multimodal salient object detection (SOD) accurately delineates the precise spatial location of objects within the picture. Their common characteristic of seeking complementary cues from different source images motivates us to explore the collaborative relationship between Fusion and Salient object detection tasks on infrared and visible images via an Interactively Reinforced multi-task paradigm for the first time, termed IRFS. To the seamless bridge of multimodal image fusion and SOD tasks, we specifically develop a Feature Screening-based Fusion subnetwork (FSFNet) to screen out interfering features from source images, thereby preserving saliency-related features. After generating the fused image through FSFNet, it is then fed into the subsequent Fusion-Guided Cross-Complementary SOD subnetwork (FC$^2$Net) as the third modality to drive the precise prediction of the saliency map by leveraging the complementary information derived from the fused image. In addition, we develop an interactive loop learning strategy to achieve the mutual reinforcement of IVIF and SOD tasks with a shorter training period and fewer network parameters. Comprehensive experiment results demonstrate that the seamless bridge of IVIF and SOD mutually enhances their performance, and highlights their superiority.</p></details> |  |

Current data is fragmented, siloed, and not easily accessible. There is data conflict, misuse, and eroding levels of trust in provenance and accuracy. With increased autonomy in aviation, Artificially Intelligent (AI) enabled unmanned traffic management (UTM) will be more reliant on secure data from diverse stakeholders. There is an urgent need to develop a secure network that has trustworthy data chains and works with the requirements generated by UTM. Here, we review existing research in 3 key interconnected areas: (1) blockchain development for secure data transfer between competing aviation stakeholders, (2) self-learning networking architectures that distribute consensus to achieve secure air traffic control, (3) explainable AI to build trust with human stakeholders and backpropagate requirements for blockchain and network optimisation. When connected together, this new digital ecosystem blueprint is tailored for safety critical UTM sectors. We motivate the readers with a case study, where a federated learning UTM uses real air traffic and weather data is secured and explained to human operators. This emerging area still requires significant research and development by the community to ensure it can enable future autonomous air mobility.</p></details> | under review in IEEE |

As a long-established problem, however, existing subspace methods suffer from either high complexity or low accuracy. In this work, we propose two efficient methods, to accomplish fast subspace computation and accurate angle of arrival (AoA) acquisition. By leveraging randomized low-rank approximation, our fast multiple signal classification (MUSIC) methods, relying on random sampling and projection techniques, substantially accelerate the subspace estimation by orders of magnitude. Moreover, we establish the theoretical bounds of our proposed methods, which ensure the accuracy of the approximated pseudo-spectrum. As demonstrated, the pseudo-spectrum acquired by our fast-MUSIC would be highly precise; and the estimated AoA is almost as accurate as standard MUSIC. In contrast, our new methods are tremendously faster than standard MUSIC. Thus, our fast-MUSIC enables the high-resolution real-time environmental sensing with massive MIMO radars, which has great potential in the emerging unmanned systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Randomized-MUSIC for mm-Wave Massive MIMO Radars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04570v1)** | 2021-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subspace methods are essential to high-resolution environment sensing in the emerging unmanned systems, if further combined with the millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technique. The estimation of signal/noise subspace, as one critical step, is yet computationally complex and presents a particular challenge when developing high-resolution yet low-complexity automotive radars. In this work, we develop a fast randomized-MUSIC (R-MUSIC) algorithm, which exploits the random matrix sketching to estimate the signal subspace via approximated computation. Our new approach substantially reduces the time complexity in acquiring a high-quality signal subspace. Moreover, the accuracy of R-MUSIC suffers no degradation unlike others low-complexity counterparts, i.e. the high-resolution angle of arrival (AoA) estimation is attained. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the performance of our R-MUSIC method. As shown, it resolves the long-standing contradiction in complexity and accuracy of MIMO radar signal processing, which hence have great potentials in real-time super-resolution automotive sensing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Path Planning of Unmanned System using Carrot-chasing Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13227v1)** | 2020-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When an unmanned system is launched for a mission-critical task, it is required to follow a predetermined path. It means the unmanned system requires a path following algorithm for the completion of the mission. Since the predetermined path is typically given by a set of data-points, not only the curvature and derivative of the pre-determined path are absent, but also it requires a large size of on-board memory. In this work, we study a simple path following algorithm called Carrot-chasing algorithm that uses a simple controller in the form of a proportional controller to control the movement of an unmanned system.</p></details> |  |
| **[P3-LOAM: PPP/LiDAR Loosely Coupled SLAM with Accurate Covariance Estimation and Robust RAIM in Urban Canyon Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02399v1)** | 2020-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has drawn increasing interests in autonomous driving. However, LiDAR-SLAM suffers from accumulating errors which can be significantly mitigated by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Precise Point Positioning (PPP), an accurate GNSS operation mode independent of base stations, gains more popularity in unmanned systems. Considering the features of the two technologies, LiDAR-SLAM and PPP, this paper proposes a SLAM system, namely P3-LOAM (PPP based LiDAR Odometry and Mapping) which couples LiDAR-SLAM and PPP. For better integration, we derive LiDAR-SLAM positioning covariance by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Jacobian model, since SVD provides an explicit analytic solution of Iterative Closest Point (ICP), which is a key issue in LiDAR-SLAM. A novel method is then proposed to evaluate the estimated LiDAR-SLAM covariance. In addition, to increase the reliability of GNSS in urban canyon environment, we develop a LiDAR-SLAM assisted GNSS Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) algorithm. Finally, we validate P$^3$-LOAM with UrbanNav, a challenging public dataset in urban canyon environment. Comprehensive test results prove that P3-LOAM outperforms benchmarks such as Single Point Positioning (SPP), PPP, LeGO-LOAM, SPP-LOAM, and loosely coupled navigation system proposed by the publisher of UrbanNav in terms of accuracy and availability.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Requirements to Autonomous Flight: An Overview of the Monitoring ICAROUS Project](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03745v1)** | 2020-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Independent Configurable Architecture for Reliable Operations of Unmanned Systems (ICAROUS) is a software architecture incorporating a set of algorithms to enable autonomous operations of unmanned aircraft applications. This paper provides an overview of Monitoring ICAROUS, a project whose objective is to provide a formal approach to generating runtime monitors for autonomous systems from requirements written in a structured natural language. This approach integrates FRET, a formal requirement elicitation and authoring tool, and Copilot, a runtime verification framework. FRET is used to specify formal requirements in structured natural language. These requirements are translated into temporal logic formulae. Copilot is then used to generate executable runtime monitors from these temporal logic specifications. The generated monitors are directly integrated into ICAROUS to perform runtime verification during flight.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings FMAS 2020, arXiv:2012.01176</p></details> |
| **[Long-distance tiny face detection based on enhanced YOLOv3 for unmanned system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04421v1)** | 2020-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote tiny face detection applied in unmanned system is a challeng-ing work. The detector cannot obtain sufficient context semantic information due to the relatively long distance. The received poor fine-grained features make the face detection less accurate and robust. To solve the problem of long-distance detection of tiny faces, we propose an enhanced network model (YOLOv3-C) based on the YOLOv3 algorithm for unmanned platform. In this model, we bring in multi-scale features from feature pyramid networks and make the features fu-sion to adjust prediction feature map of the output, which improves the sensitivity of the entire algorithm for tiny target faces. The enhanced model improves the accuracy of tiny face detection in the cases of long-distance and high-density crowds. The experimental evaluation results demonstrated the superior perfor-mance of the proposed YOLOv3-C in comparison with other relevant detectors in remote tiny face detection. It is worth mentioning that our proposed method achieves comparable performance with the state of the art YOLOv4[1] in the tiny face detection tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion Planning for Heterogeneous Unmanned Systems under Partial Observation from UAV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09633v2)** | 2020-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For heterogeneous unmanned systems composed of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), using UAVs serve as eyes to assist UGVs in motion planning is a promising research direction due to the UAVs' vast view scope. However, due to UAVs flight altitude limitations, it may be impossible to observe the global map, and motion planning in the local map is a POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) problem. This paper proposes a motion planning algorithm for heterogeneous unmanned system under partial observation from UAV without reconstruction of global maps, which consists of two parts designed for perception and decision-making, respectively. For the perception part, we propose the Grid Map Generation Network (GMGN), which is used to perceive scenes from UAV's perspective and classify the pathways and obstacles. For the decision-making part, we propose the Motion Command Generation Network (MCGN). Due to the addition of memory mechanism, MCGN has planning and reasoning abilities under partial observation from UAVs. We evaluate our proposed algorithm by comparing with baseline algorithms. The results show that our method effectively plans the motion of heterogeneous unmanned systems and achieves a relatively high success rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Cooperative Robotics and Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12230v1)** | 2020-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intersection of Quantum Technologies and Robotics Autonomy is explored in the present paper. The two areas are brought together in establishing an interdisciplinary interface that contributes to advancing the field of system autonomy, and pushes the engineering boundaries beyond the existing techniques. The present research adopts the experimental aspects of quantum entanglement and quantum cryptography, and integrates these established quantum capabilities into distributed robotic platforms, to explore the possibility of achieving increased autonomy for the control of multi-agent robotic systems engaged in cooperative tasks. Experimental quantum capabilities are realized by producing single photons (using spontaneous parametric down-conversion process), polarization of photons, detecting vertical and horizontal polarizations, and single photon detecting/counting. Specifically, such quantum aspects are implemented on network of classical agents, i.e., classical aerial and ground robots/unmanned systems. With respect to classical systems for robotic applications, leveraging quantum technology is expected to lead to guaranteed security, very fast control and communication, and unparalleled quantum capabilities such as entanglement and quantum superposition that will enable novel applications.</p></details> | 18 pages, 21 figures |

There has been tremendous growth in different applications of UAVs such as lifesaving and rescue missions, commercial use, recreations, etc. Unlike the traditional wireless communications, the data links for these systems do not have any general standardized framework yet to ensure safe co-existence of UAVs with other flying vehicles. This motivated us to provide a comprehensive survey of potential data link technologies available for UAVs. Our goal is to study the current trends and available candidates and carry out a comprehensive comparison among them. The contribution of this survey is to highlight the strength and weakness of the current data link options and their suitability to satisfy the UAVs communication requirements. Satellite links, cellular technologies, Wi-Fi and several similar wireless technologies are studied thoroughly in this paper. We also focus on several available promising standards that can be modified for these data links. Then, we discuss standard-related organizations that are working actively in the area of civilian unmanned systems. Finally, we bring up some future challenges in this area with several potential solutions to motivate further research work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Collision Probability Estimation Based on Finite-Dimensional Monte Carlo Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03973v1)** | 2020-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety concern for unmanned systems, namely the concern for the potential casualty caused by system abnormalities, has been a bottleneck for their development, especially in populated areas. Evidently, the collision between the unmanned system and the obstacles, including both moving and static objects, accounts for a great proportion of the system abnormalities. The route planning and corresponding controller are established in order to avoid the collision, whereas, in the presence of uncertainties, it is possible that the unmanned system would deviate from the predetermined route and collide with the obstacles. Therefore, for the safety of unmanned systems, collision probability estimation and further safety decision are very important. To estimate the collision probability, the Monte Carlo method could be applied, however, it is generally rather slow. This paper introduces a fast collision probability estimation method based on finite-dimensional distribution, whose main idea is to filter out the sampling points needed and generate the states directly by samples of finite-dimensional distribution, reducing the estimation time significantly. Besides, further techniques including the probabilistic equidistance sampling and dimension reduction, also serve to reduce the estimation time. The simulation shows that the proposed method reduces over 99% of the estimation time.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink) in a Nutshell: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10641v1)** | 2019-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink in short) is a communication protocol for unmanned systems (e.g., drones, robots). It specifies a comprehensive set of messages exchanged between unmanned systems and ground stations. This protocol is used in major autopilot systems, mainly ArduPilot and PX4, and provides powerful features not only for monitoring and controlling unmanned systems missions but also for their integration into the Internet. However, there is no technical survey and/or tutorial in the literature that presents these features or explains how to make use of them. Most of the references are online tutorials and basic technical reports, and none of them presents comprehensive and systematic coverage of the protocol. In this paper, we address this gap, and we propose an overview of the MAVLink protocol, the difference between its versions, and its potential in enabling Internet connectivity to unmanned systems. We also discuss the security aspects of MAVLink. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first technical survey and tutorial on the MAVLink protocol, which represents an important reference for unmanned systems users and developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Access, June 2019</p></details> |
| **[Fast Online Exact Solutions for Deterministic MDPs with Sparse Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02785v3)** | 2018-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are a mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision making under uncertainty. The classical approaches for solving MDPs are well known and have been widely studied, some of which rely on approximation techniques to solve MDPs with large state space and/or action space. However, most of these classical solution approaches and their approximation techniques still take much computation time to converge and usually must be re-computed if the reward function is changed. This paper introduces a novel alternative approach for exactly and efficiently solving deterministic, continuous MDPs with sparse reward sources. When the environment is such that the "distance" between states can be determined in constant time, e.g. grid world, our algorithm offers $O( |R|^2 \times |A|^2 \times |S|)$, where $|R|$ is the number of reward sources, $|A|$ is the number of actions, and $|S|$ is the number of states. Memory complexity for the algorithm is $O( |S| + |R| \times |A|)$. This new approach opens new avenues for boosting computational performance for certain classes of MDPs and is of tremendous value for MDP applications such as robotics and unmanned systems. This paper describes the algorithm and presents numerical experiment results to demonstrate its powerful computational performance. We also provide rigorous mathematical description of the approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NIPS 2018; preprint version posted here. 8 pages content, appendices include pseudocode and proof for algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Objective Cooperative Search of Spatially Diverse Routes in Uncertain Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04881v1)** | 2017-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on developing new navigation and reconnaissance capabilities for cooperative unmanned systems in uncertain environments. The goal is to design a cooperative multi-vehicle system that can survey an unknown environment and find the most valuable route for personnel to travel. To accomplish the goal, the multi-vehicle system first explores spatially diverse routes and then selects the safest route. In particular, the proposed cooperative path planner sequentially generates a set of spatially diverse routes according to a number of factors, including travel distance, ease of travel, and uncertainty associated with the ease of travel. The planner's dependence on each of these factors is altered by a weighted score, doing so changes the criteria for determining an optimum route. To penalize the selection of same paths by different vehicles, a control gain is used to increase the cost of paths that lie near the route(s) assigned to other vehicles. By varying the control gain, the spatial diversity among routes can be accomplished. By repeatedly searching for different paths cooperatively, an optimal path can be selected that yields the most valuable route.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to a conference</p></details> |

Target localization plays a crucial role in numerous applications, such as search, and rescue missions, traffic management and surveillance. The objective of this paper is to present an innovative target location learning approach, where numerous machine learning approaches, including K-means clustering and supported vector machines (SVM), are used to learn the data pattern across a list of spatially distributed sensors. To enable the accurate data association from different sensors for accurate target localization, appropriate data pre-processing is essential, which is then followed by the application of different machine learning algorithms to appropriately group data from different sensors for the accurate localization of multiple targets. Through simulation examples, the performance of these machine learning algorithms is quantified and compared.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted for conference publication</p></details> |
