| **[RLAnything: Forge Environment, Policy, and Reward Model in Completely Dynamic RL System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02488v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose RLAnything, a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically forges environment, policy, and reward models through closed-loop optimization, amplifying learning signals and strengthening the overall RL system for any LLM or agentic scenarios. Specifically, the policy is trained with integrated feedback from step-wise and outcome signals, while the reward model is jointly optimized via consistency feedback, which in turn further improves policy training. Moreover, our theory-motivated automatic environment adaptation improves training for both the reward and policy models by leveraging critic feedback from each, enabling learning from experience. Empirically, each added component consistently improves the overall system, and RLAnything yields substantial gains across various representative LLM and agentic tasks, boosting Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking by 9.1% on OSWorld and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct by 18.7% and 11.9% on AlfWorld and LiveBench, respectively. We also that optimized reward-model signals outperform outcomes that rely on human labels.

| **[Expanding the Capabilities of Reinforcement Learning via Text Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02482v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of RL for LLM post-training stems from an unreasonably uninformative source: a single bit of information per rollout as binary reward or preference label. At the other extreme, distillation offers dense supervision but requires demonstrations, which are costly and difficult to scale. We study text feedback as an intermediate signal: richer than scalar rewards, yet cheaper than complete demonstrations. Textual feedback is a natural mode of human interaction and is already abundant in many real-world settings, where users, annotators, and automated judges routinely critique LLM outputs. Towards leveraging text feedback at scale, we formalize a multi-turn RL setup, RL from Text Feedback (RLTF), where text feedback is available during training but not at inference. Therefore, models must learn to internalize the feedback in order to improve their test-time single-turn performance. To do this, we propose two methods: Self Distillation (RLTF-SD), which trains the single-turn policy to match its own feedback-conditioned second-turn generations; and Feedback Modeling (RLTF-FM), which predicts the feedback as an auxiliary objective. We provide theoretical analysis on both methods, and empirically evaluate on reasoning puzzles, competition math, and creative writing tasks. Our results show that both methods consistently outperform strong baselines across benchmarks, highlighting the potential of RL with an additional source of rich supervision at scale.</p></details> | 43 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Training LLMs for Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning Elevates Test-Time Scalability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02477v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities through step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Nevertheless, at the limits of model capability, CoT often proves insufficient, and its strictly sequential nature constrains test-time scalability. A potential alternative is divide-and-conquer (DAC) reasoning, which decomposes a complex problem into subproblems to facilitate more effective exploration of the solution. Although promising, our analysis reveals a fundamental misalignment between general-purpose post-training and DAC-style inference, which limits the model's capacity to fully leverage this potential. To bridge this gap and fully unlock LLMs' reasoning capabilities on the most challenging tasks, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework to enhance their DAC-style reasoning capacity. At each step, the policy decomposes a problem into a group of subproblems, solves them sequentially, and addresses the original one conditioned on the subproblem solutions, with both decomposition and solution integrated into RL training. Under comparable training, our DAC-style framework endows the model with a higher performance ceiling and stronger test-time scalability, surpassing CoT by 8.6% in Pass@1 and 6.3% in Pass@32 on competition-level benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIC-VLA: A Think-in-Control Vision-Language-Action Model for Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02459v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots in dynamic, human-centric environments must follow language instructions while maintaining real-time reactive control. Vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising framework, but they assume temporally aligned reasoning and control, despite semantic inference being inherently delayed relative to real-time action. We introduce Think-in-Control (TIC)-VLA, a latency-aware framework that explicitly models delayed semantic reasoning during action generation. TIC-VLA defines a delayed semantic-control interface that conditions action generation on delayed vision-language semantic states and explicit latency metadata, in addition to current observations, enabling policies to compensate for asynchronous reasoning. We further propose a latency-consistent training pipeline that injects reasoning inference delays during imitation learning and online reinforcement learning, aligning training with asynchronous deployment. To support realistic evaluation, we present DynaNav, a physics-accurate, photo-realistic simulation suite for language-guided navigation in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments in simulation and on a real robot show that TIC-VLA consistently outperforms prior VLA models while maintaining robust real-time control under multi-second reasoning latency.

| **[Conflict-Aware Client Selection for Multi-Server Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02458v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising distributed machine learning (ML) that enables collaborative model training across clients without exposing raw data, thereby preserving user privacy and reducing communication costs. Despite these benefits, traditional single-server FL suffers from high communication latency due to the aggregation of models from a large number of clients. While multi-server FL distributes workloads across edge servers, overlapping client coverage and uncoordinated selection often lead to resource contention, causing bandwidth conflicts and training failures. To address these limitations, we propose a decentralized reinforcement learning with conflict risk prediction, named RL CRP, to optimize client selection in multi-server FL systems. Specifically, each server estimates the likelihood of client selection conflicts using a categorical hidden Markov model based on its sparse historical client selection sequence. Then, a fairness-aware reward mechanism is incorporated to promote long-term client participation for minimizing training latency and resource contention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RL-CRP framework effectively reduces inter-server conflicts and significantly improves training efficiency in terms of convergence speed and communication cost.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[World-Gymnast: Training Robots with Reinforcement Learning in a World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02454v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning from interacting with the physical world is fundamentally bottlenecked by the cost of physical interaction. The two alternatives, supervised finetuning (SFT) from expert demonstrations and reinforcement learning (RL) in a software-based simulator, are limited by the amount of expert data available and the sim-to-real gap for manipulation. With the recent emergence of world models learned from real-world video-action data, we ask the question of whether training a policy in a world model can be more effective than supervised learning or software simulation in achieving better real-robot performance. We propose World-Gymnast, which performs RL finetuning of a vision-language-action (VLA) policy by rolling out the policy in an action-conditioned video world model and rewarding the rollouts with a vision-language model (VLM). On the Bridge robot setup, World-Gymnast outperforms SFT by as much as 18x and outperforms software simulator by as much as 2x. More importantly, World-Gymnast demonstrates intriguing capabilities of RL with a world model, including training on diverse language instructions and novel scenes from the world model, test-time training in a novel scene, and online iterative world model and policy improvement. Our results suggest learning a world model and training robot policies in the cloud could be the key to bridging the gap between robots that work in demonstrations and robots that can work in anyone's household.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://world-gymnast.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Reward Evolution with Graph-of-Thoughts: A Bi-Level Language Model Framework for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16136v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective reward functions remains a major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), often requiring considerable human expertise and iterative refinement. Recent advances leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated reward design, but these approaches are limited by hallucinations, reliance on human feedback, and challenges with handling complex, multi-step tasks. In this work, we introduce Reward Evolution with Graph-of-Thoughts (RE-GoT), a novel bi-level framework that enhances LLMs with structured graph-based reasoning and integrates Visual Language Models (VLMs) for automated rollout evaluation. RE-GoT first decomposes tasks into text-attributed graphs, enabling comprehensive analysis and reward function generation, and then iteratively refines rewards using visual feedback from VLMs without human intervention. Extensive experiments on 10 RoboGen and 4 ManiSkill2 tasks demonstrate that RE-GoT consistently outperforms existing LLM-based baselines. On RoboGen, our method improves average task success rates by 32.25%, with notable gains on complex multi-step tasks. On ManiSkill2, RE-GoT achieves an average success rate of 93.73% across four diverse manipulation tasks, significantly surpassing prior LLM-based approaches and even exceeding expert-designed rewards. Our results indicate that combining LLMs and VLMs with graph-of-thoughts reasoning provides a scalable and effective solution for autonomous reward evolution in RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reverse Engineering Human Preferences with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15795v3)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are routinely evaluated by other LLMs trained to predict human preferences. This framework--known as LLM-as-a-judge--is highly scalable and relatively low cost. However, it is also vulnerable to malicious exploitation, as LLM responses can be tuned to overfit the preferences of the judge. Previous work shows that the answers generated by a candidate-LLM can be edited post hoc to maximise the score assigned to them by a judge-LLM. In this study, we adopt a different approach and use the signal provided by judge-LLMs as a reward to adversarially tune models that generate text preambles designed to boost downstream performance. We find that frozen LLMs pipelined with these models attain higher LLM-evaluation scores than existing frameworks. Crucially, unlike other frameworks which intervene directly on the model's response, our method is virtually undetectable. We also demonstrate that the effectiveness of the tuned preamble generator transfers when the candidate-LLM and the judge-LLM are replaced with models that are not used during training. These findings raise important questions about the design of more reliable LLM-as-a-judge evaluation settings. They also demonstrate that human preferences can be reverse engineered effectively, by pipelining LLMs to optimise upstream preambles via reinforcement learning--an approach that could find future applications in diverse tasks and domains beyond adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[David vs. Goliath: Verifiable Agent-to-Agent Jailbreaking via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02395v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of large language models into autonomous agents introduces adversarial failures that exploit legitimate tool privileges, transforming safety evaluation in tool-augmented environments from a subjective NLP task into an objective control problem. We formalize this threat model as Tag-Along Attacks: a scenario where a tool-less adversary "tags along" on the trusted privileges of a safety-aligned Operator to induce prohibited tool use through conversation alone. To validate this threat, we present Slingshot, a 'cold-start' reinforcement learning framework that autonomously discovers emergent attack vectors, revealing a critical insight: in our setting, learned attacks tend to converge to short, instruction-like syntactic patterns rather than multi-turn persuasion. On held-out extreme-difficulty tasks, Slingshot achieves a 67.0% success rate against a Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ Operator (vs. 1.7% baseline), reducing the expected attempts to first success (on solved tasks) from 52.3 to 1.3. Crucially, Slingshot transfers zero-shot to several model families, including closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Flash (56.0% attack success rate) and defensive-fine-tuned open-source models like Meta-SecAlign-8B (39.2% attack success rate). Our work establishes Tag-Along Attacks as a first-class, verifiable threat model and shows that effective agentic attacks can be elicited from off-the-shelf open-weight models through environment interaction alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. 8 main pages, 2 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Outcome-Based RL Provably Leads Transformers to Reason, but Only With the Right Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15158v3)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) with outcome-based supervision can spontaneously develop the ability to generate intermediate reasoning steps (Chain-of-Thought). Yet the mechanism by which sparse rewards drive policy gradient to discover such systematic reasoning remains poorly understood. We address this by analyzing the policy gradient dynamics of single-layer Transformers on a synthetic graph traversal task that cannot be solved without Chain-of-Thought but admits a simple iterative solution. We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, policy gradient drives the Transformer to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of "simple examples": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps. When the training distribution places sufficient mass on these simpler examples, the Transformer learns a generalizable traversal strategy that extrapolates to longer chains; when this mass vanishes, policy gradient learning becomes infeasible. We corroborate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic data and with real-world language models on mathematical reasoning tasks, validating that our theoretical findings carry over to practical settings.</p></details> | 87 pages, 6 figures |
| **[SLIME: Stabilized Likelihood Implicit Margin Enforcement for Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02383v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct preference optimization methods have emerged as a computationally efficient alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs). Latest approaches have streamlined the alignment process by deriving implicit reward functions, yet they often suffer from a critical objective mismatch: optimizing the relative margin between chosen and rejected responses does not guarantee the preservation of the chosen response's absolute likelihood. This can lead to ``unlearning'', where the model degrades the probability of high-quality outputs to satisfy margin constraints, and ``formatting collapse'' caused by the over-penalization of rejected sequences. In this work, we introduce SLIME (Stabilized Likelihood Implicit Margin Enforcement), a reference-free alignment objective designed to decouple preference learning from generation quality. SLIME incorporates a three-pronged objective: (1) an anchoring term to maximize the likelihood of preferred responses; (2) a stabilizing penalty that prevents the probabilities of rejected tokens from collapsing to zero; and (3) a dual-margin mechanism that combines hard and soft constraints for precise boundary shaping. Our results demonstrate that SLIME achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining higher generation stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Personalized Reward Model for Vision Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02380v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have significantly propelled the development of visual generation. Existing frameworks typically adopt Bradley-Terry-style preference modeling or leverage generative VLMs as judges, and subsequently optimize visual generation models via reinforcement learning. However, current RMs suffer from inherent limitations: they often follow a one-size-fits-all paradigm that assumes a monolithic preference distribution or relies on fixed evaluation rubrics. As a result, they are insensitive to content-specific visual cues, leading to systematic misalignment with subjective and context-dependent human preferences. To this end, inspired by human assessment, we propose UnifiedReward-Flex, a unified personalized reward model for vision generation that couples reward modeling with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning. Specifically, given a prompt and the generated visual content, it first interprets the semantic intent and grounds on visual evidence, then dynamically constructs a hierarchical assessment by instantiating fine-grained criteria under both predefined and self-generated high-level dimensions. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage process: (1) we first distill structured, high-quality reasoning traces from advanced closed-source VLMs to bootstrap SFT, equipping the model with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning behaviors; (2) we then perform direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated preference pairs to further strengthen reasoning fidelity and discriminative alignment. To validate the effectiveness, we integrate UnifiedReward-Flex into the GRPO framework for image and video synthesis, and extensive results demonstrate its superiority.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://codegoat24.github.io/UnifiedReward/flex</p></details> |
| **[Proof-RM: A Scalable and Generalizable Reward Model for Math Proof](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02377v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong math reasoning abilities through Reinforcement Learning with *Verifiable Rewards* (RLVR), many advanced mathematical problems are proof-based, with no guaranteed way to determine the authenticity of a proof by simple answer matching. To enable automatic verification, a Reward Model (RM) capable of reliably evaluating full proof processes is required. In this work, we design a *scalable* data-construction pipeline that, with minimal human effort, leverages LLMs to generate a large quantity of high-quality "**question-proof-check**" triplet data. By systematically varying problem sources, generation methods, and model configurations, we create diverse problem-proof pairs spanning multiple difficulty levels, linguistic styles, and error types, subsequently filtered through hierarchical human review for label alignment. Utilizing these data, we train a proof-checking RM, incorporating additional process reward and token weight balance to stabilize the RL process. Our experiments validate the model's scalability and strong performance from multiple perspectives, including reward accuracy, generalization ability and test-time guidance, providing important practical recipes and tools for strengthening LLM mathematical capabilities.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[SWE-Universe: Scale Real-World Verifiable Environments to Millions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02361v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose SWE-Universe, a scalable and efficient framework for automatically constructing real-world software engineering (SWE) verifiable environments from GitHub pull requests (PRs). To overcome the prevalent challenges of automatic building, such as low production yield, weak verifiers, and prohibitive cost, our framework utilizes a building agent powered by an efficient custom-trained model. This agent employs iterative self-verification and in-loop hacking detection to ensure the reliable generation of high-fidelity, verifiable tasks. Using this method, we scale the number of real-world multilingual SWE environments to a million scale (807,693). We demonstrate the profound value of our environments through large-scale agentic mid-training and reinforcement learning. Finally, we applied this technique to Qwen3-Max-Thinking and achieved a score of 75.3% on SWE-Bench Verified. Our work provides both a critical resource and a robust methodology to advance the next generation of coding agents.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Position: Explaining Behavioral Shifts in Large Language Models Requires a Comparative Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02304v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale foundation models exhibit behavioral shifts: intervention-induced behavioral changes that appear after scaling, fine-tuning, reinforcement learning or in-context learning. While investigating these phenomena have recently received attention, explaining their appearance is still overlooked. Classic explainable AI (XAI) methods can surface failures at a single checkpoint of a model, but they are structurally ill-suited to justify what changed internally across different checkpoints and which explanatory claims are warranted about that change. We take the position that behavioral shifts should be explained comparatively: the core target should be the intervention-induced shift between a reference model and an intervened model, rather than any single model in isolation. To this aim we formulate a Comparative XAI ($Δ$-XAI) framework with a set of desiderata to be taken into account when designing proper explaining methods. To highlight how $Δ$-XAI methods work, we introduce a set of possible pipelines, relate them to the desiderata, and provide a concrete $Δ$-XAI experiment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing General-Purpose Reasoning Models with Modular Gradient Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02301v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has played a central role in recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs), yielding strong gains in verifiable and open-ended reasoning. However, training a single general-purpose LRM across diverse domains remains challenging due to pronounced domain heterogeneity. Through a systematic study of two widely used strategies, Sequential RL and Mixed RL, we find that both incur substantial cross-domain interference at the behavioral and gradient levels, resulting in limited overall gains. To address these challenges, we introduce **M**odular **G**radient **S**urgery (**MGS**), which resolves gradient conflicts at the module level within the transformer. When applied to Llama and Qwen models, MGS achieves average improvements of 4.3 (16.6\%) and 4.5 (11.1\%) points, respectively, over standard multi-task RL across three representative domains (math, general chat, and instruction following). Further analysis demonstrates that MGS remains effective under prolonged training. Overall, our study clarifies the sources of interference in multi-domain RL and presents an effective solution for training general-purpose LRMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; Code: https://github.com/StringNLPLAB/MGS; Website: https://modular-gradient-surgery.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Choice-Model-Assisted Q-learning for Delayed-Feedback Revenue Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02283v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study reinforcement learning for revenue management with delayed feedback, where a substantial fraction of value is determined by customer cancellations and modifications observed days after booking. We propose \emph{choice-model-assisted RL}: a calibrated discrete choice model is used as a fixed partial world model to impute the delayed component of the learning target at decision time. In the fixed-model deployment regime, we prove that tabular Q-learning with model-imputed targets converges to an $O(\varepsilon/(1-γ))$ neighborhood of the optimal Q-function, where $\varepsilon$ summarizes partial-model error, with an additional $O(t^{-1/2})$ sampling term. Experiments in a simulator calibrated from 61{,}619 hotel bookings (1{,}088 independent runs) show: (i) no statistically detectable difference from a maturity-buffer DQN baseline in stationary settings; (ii) positive effects under in-family parameter shifts, with significant gains in 5 of 10 shift scenarios after Holm--Bonferroni correction (up to 12.4\%); and (iii) consistent degradation under structural misspecification, where the choice model assumptions are violated (1.4--2.6\% lower revenue). These results characterize when partial behavioral models improve robustness under shift and when they introduce harmful bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[HER: Human-like Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning for LLM Role-playing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21459v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM role-playing, i.e., using LLMs to simulate specific personas, has emerged as a key capability in various applications, such as companionship, content creation, and digital games. While current models effectively capture character tones and knowledge, simulating the inner thoughts behind their behaviors remains a challenge. Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models. Leveraging these resources, we train HER models based on Qwen3-32B via supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench. Our datasets, principles, and models will be released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | 41pages, 10 figures |

Agent Swarm also reduces latency by up to $4.5\times$ over single-agent baselines.

| **[Learning Markov Decision Processes under Fully Bandit Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02260v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A standard assumption in Reinforcement Learning is that the agent observes every visited state-action pair in the associated Markov Decision Process (MDP), along with the per-step rewards. Strong theoretical results are known in this setting, achieving nearly-tight $Θ(\sqrt{T})$-regret bounds. However, such detailed feedback can be unrealistic, and recent research has investigated more restricted settings such as trajectory feedback, where the agent observes all the visited state-action pairs, but only a single \emph{aggregate} reward. In this paper, we consider a far more restrictive ``fully bandit'' feedback model for episodic MDPs, where the agent does not even observe the visited state-action pairs -- it only learns the aggregate reward. We provide the first efficient bandit learning algorithm for episodic MDPs with $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Our regret has an exponential dependence on the horizon length $\H$, which we show is necessary. We also obtain improved nearly-tight regret bounds for ``ordered'' MDPs; these can be used to model classical stochastic optimization problems such as $k$-item prophet inequality and sequential posted pricing. Finally, we evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm for the setting of $k$-item prophet inequalities; despite the highly restricted feedback, our algorithm's performance is comparable to that of a state-of-art learning algorithm (UCB-VI) with detailed state-action feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segment to Focus: Guiding Latent Action Models in the Presence of Distractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02259v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent Action Models (LAMs) learn to extract action-relevant representations solely from raw observations, enabling reinforcement learning from unlabelled videos and significantly scaling available training data. However, LAMs face a critical challenge in disentangling action-relevant features from action-correlated noise (e.g., background motion). Failing to filter these distractors causes LAMs to capture spurious correlations and build sub-optimal latent action spaces. In this paper, we introduce MaskLAM -- a lightweight modification to LAM training to mitigate this issue by incorporating visual agent segmentation. MaskLAM utilises segmentation masks from pretrained foundation models to weight the LAM reconstruction loss, thereby prioritising salient information over background elements while requiring no architectural modifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on continuous-control MuJoCo tasks, modified with action-correlated background noise. Our approach yields up to a 4x increase in accrued rewards compared to standard baselines and a 3x improvement in the latent action quality, as evidenced by linear probe evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing a unified information-geometric framework, we introduce (Kalman)-Wasserstein-based KL analogues by replacing the Fisher-Rao geometry in the dynamical formulation of the KL with transport-based geometries, and we derive closed-form values for common distribution families. These divergences remain finite under support mismatch and yield a geometric interpretation of regularization heuristics used in Kalman ensemble methods. We demonstrate the utility of these divergences in KL-regularized optimal control. In the fully tractable setting of linear time-invariant systems with Gaussian process noise, the classical KL reduces to a quadratic control penalty that becomes singular as process noise vanishes. Our variants remove this singularity, yielding well-posed problems. On a double integrator and a cart-pole example, the resulting controls outperform KL-based regularization.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 9 figures, comments welcome</p></details> |
| **[Cumulative Treatment Effect Testing under Continuous Time Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02246v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the impact of treatment effect over time is a fundamental aspect of many scientific and medical studies. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach under a continuous-time reinforcement learning framework for testing a treatment effect. Specifically, our method provides an effective test on carryover effects of treatment over time utilizing the average treatment effect (ATE). The average treatment effect is defined as difference of value functions over an infinite horizon, which accounts for cumulative treatment effects, both immediate and carryover. The proposed method outperforms existing testing procedures such as discrete time reinforcement learning strategies in multi-resolution observation settings where observation times can be irregular. Another advantage of the proposed method is that it can capture treatment effects of a shorter duration and provide greater accuracy compared to discrete-time approximations, through the use of continuous-time estimation for the value function. We establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed test statistics and apply it to OhioT1DM diabetes data to evaluate the cumulative treatment effects of bolus insulin on patients' glucose levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning While Staying Curious: Entropy-Preserving Supervised Fine-Tuning via Adaptive Self-Distillation for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02244v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard post-training recipe for large reasoning models, supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning (SFT-then-RL), may limit the benefits of the RL stage: while SFT imitates expert demonstrations, it often causes overconfidence and reduces generation diversity, leaving RL with a narrowed solution space to explore. Adding entropy regularization during SFT is not a cure-all; it tends to flatten token distributions toward uniformity, increasing entropy without improving meaningful exploration capability. In this paper, we propose CurioSFT, an entropy-preserving SFT method designed to enhance exploration capabilities through intrinsic curiosity. It consists of (a) Self-Exploratory Distillation, which distills the model toward a self-generated, temperature-scaled teacher to encourage exploration within its capability; and (b) Entropy-Guided Temperature Selection, which adaptively adjusts distillation strength to mitigate knowledge forgetting by amplifying exploration at reasoning tokens while stabilizing factual tokens. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that, in SFT stage, CurioSFT outperforms the vanilla SFT by 2.5 points on in-distribution tasks and 2.9 points on out-of-distribution tasks. We also verify that exploration capabilities preserved during SFT successfully translate into concrete gains in RL stage, yielding an average improvement of 5.0 points.</p></details> |  |

When autonomous systems encounter environmental changes in system dynamics, sensor drift, or task objectives, fixed policies rapidly degrade in performance. We show that employing Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RTRRL), a biologically plausible algorithm for online adaptation, can effectively fine-tune a pretrained policy to improve autonomous agents' performance on driving tasks. We further show that RTRRL synergizes with a recent biologically inspired recurrent network model, the Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance RNN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this closed-loop approach in a simulated CarRacing environment and in a real-world line-following task with a RoboRacer car equipped with an event camera.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Meets Masked Generative Models: Mask-GRPO for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13418v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on https://github.com/xingzhejun/Mask-GRPO</p></details> |  |

Prior diffusion unlearning methods typically rely on supervised weight edits or global penalties; reinforcement-learning (RL) approaches, while flexible, often optimize sparse end-of-trajectory rewards, yielding high-variance updates and weak credit assignment. We present a general RL framework for diffusion unlearning that treats denoising as a sequential decision process and introduces a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards. Concretely, we train a CLIP-based reward predictor on noisy latents and use its per-step signal to compute advantage estimates for policy-gradient updates of the reverse diffusion kernel. Our algorithm is simple to implement, supports off-policy reuse, and plugs into standard text-to-image backbones. Across multiple concepts, the method achieves better or comparable forgetting to strong baselines while maintaining image quality and benign prompt fidelity; ablations show that (i) per-step critics and (ii) noisy-conditioned rewards are key to stability and effectiveness. We release code and evaluation scripts to facilitate reproducibility and future research on RL-based diffusion unlearning.</p></details> | Preprint |

Our OneMall systematically unifies the e-commerce's multiple item distribution scenarios, such as Product-card, short-video and live-streaming. Specifically, it comprises three key components, aligning the entire model training pipeline to the LLM's pre-training/post-training: (1) E-commerce Semantic Tokenizer: we provide a tokenizer solution that captures both real-world semantics and business-specific item relations across different scenarios; (2) Transformer-based Architecture: we largely utilize Transformer as our model backbone, e.g., employing Query-Former for long sequence compression, Cross-Attention for multi-behavior sequence fusion, and Sparse MoE for scalable auto-regressive generation; (3) Reinforcement Learning Pipeline: we further connect retrieval and ranking models via RL, enabling the ranking model to serve as a reward signal for end-to-end policy retrieval model optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OneMall achieves consistent improvements across all e-commerce scenarios: +13.01\% GMV in product-card, +15.32\% Orders in Short-Video, and +2.78\% Orders in Live-Streaming. OneMall has been deployed, serving over 400 million daily active users at Kuaishou.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Distributing rollout execution offers opportunities to leverage more cost-efficient inference resources, but introduces challenges in wide-area coordination and policy dissemination. We present ECHO-2, a distributed RL framework for post-training with remote inference workers and non-negligible dissemination latency. ECHO-2 combines centralized learning with distributed rollouts and treats bounded policy staleness as a user-controlled parameter, enabling rollout generation, dissemination, and training to overlap. We introduce an overlap-based capacity model that relates training time, dissemination latency, and rollout throughput, yielding a practical provisioning rule for sustaining learner utilization. To mitigate dissemination bottlenecks and lower cost, ECHO-2 employs peer-assisted pipelined broadcast and cost-aware activation of heterogeneous workers. Experiments on GRPO post-training of 4B and 8B models under real wide-area bandwidth regimes show that ECHO-2 significantly improves cost efficiency while preserving RL reward comparable to strong baselines.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) employs expectile regression to achieve in-sample learning. Nevertheless, IQL relies on a fixed expectile hyperparameter and a density-based policy improvement method, both of which impede its adaptability and performance. In this paper, we propose Projective IQL (PIQL), a projective variant of IQL enhanced with a support constraint. In the policy evaluation stage, PIQL substitutes the fixed expectile hyperparameter with a projection-based parameter and extends the one-step value estimation to a multi-step formulation. In the policy improvement stage, PIQL adopts a support constraint instead of a density constraint, ensuring closer alignment with the policy evaluation. Theoretically, we demonstrate that PIQL maintains the expectile regression and in-sample learning framework, guarantees monotonic policy improvement, and introduces a progressively more rigorous criterion for advantageous actions. Experiments on D4RL and NeoRL2 benchmarks demonstrate robust gains across diverse domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance overall.</p></details> |  |
| **[VQAThinker: Exploring Generalizable and Explainable Video Quality Assessment via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06051v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video quality assessment (VQA) aims to objectively quantify perceptual quality degradation in alignment with human visual perception. Despite recent advances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations: \textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and \textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large multimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video quality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making. Specifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided reinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality under score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a \textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction error decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth; (2) a \textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly determine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \textbf{temporal consistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent videos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD VQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring. Furthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its superiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to existing explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that reinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building generalizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 |

We study lightweight steering vectors inserted into the base model's residual stream and trained with a reinforcement-learning objective. These vectors explain a large portion of full fine-tuning performance increase while preserving the interpretability of small, additive interventions. We find that (i) the last-layer steering vector acts like a token-substitution bias concentrated on the first generated token, consistently boosting tokens such as "To" and "Step"; (ii) the penultimate-layer vector leaves attention patterns largely intact and instead operates through the MLP and unembedding, preferentially up-weighting process words and structure symbols; and (iii) the steering vectors transfer to other models from the same family. Taken together, these results deepen understanding of how trained steering vectors shape computation and should inform future work in activation engineering and the study of reasoning models.</p></details> | Preprint |

Through empirical analysis, we identify that current LRMs lack the capability of sub-task decomposition in complex tool use scenarios, leading to Lazy Reasoning. To address this, we propose a two-stage training framework D-CORE~(\underline{\textbf{D}}ecomposing tasks and \underline{\textbf{Co}}mposing \underline{\textbf{Re}}asoning processes) that first incentivize the LRMs' task decomposition reasoning capability via self-distillation, followed by diversity-aware reinforcement learning~(RL) to restore LRMs' reflective reasoning capability. D-CORE achieves robust tool-use improvements across diverse benchmarks and model scales. Experiments on BFCLv3 demonstrate superiority of our method: D-CORE-8B reaches 77.7\% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing 8B model by 5.7\%. Meanwhile, D-CORE-14B establishes a new state-of-the-art at 79.3\%, outperforming 70B models despite being 5$\times$ smaller.

To reduce overhead and improve exploration, prior work introduces tree structured rollouts, which share reasoning prefixes and branch at key nodes to improve sampling efficiency. However, this paradigm still faces two challenges: (1) high entropy branching can trigger rollout collapse, where the branching budget concentrates on a few trajectories with consecutive high-entropy segments, rapidly reducing the number of effective branches; (2) early pseudo-labels are noisy and biased, which can induce self-reinforcing overfitting, causing the policy to sharpen prematurely and suppress exploration. To address these issues, we propose Entropy Confidence Hybrid Group Relative Policy Optimization (ECHO). During rollout, ECHO jointly leverages local entropy and group level confidence to adaptively control branch width, and further introduces online confidence-based pruning to terminate persistently low confidence branches, avoiding high entropy traps and mitigating collapse. During policy updates, ECHO employs confidence adaptive clipping and an entropy confidence hybrid advantage shaping approach to enhance training robustness and mitigate early stage bias. Experiments demonstrate that ECHO achieves consistent gains on multiple mathematical and visual reasoning benchmarks, and generalizes more effectively under a limited rollout budget.</p></details> | 19 ppages |
| **[Learning Generative Selection for Best-of-N](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02143v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling test-time compute via parallel sampling can substantially improve LLM reasoning, but is often limited by Best-of-N selection quality. Generative selection methods, such as GenSelect, address this bottleneck, yet strong selection performance remains largely limited to large models. We show that small reasoning models can acquire strong GenSelect capabilities through targeted reinforcement learning. To this end, we synthesize selection tasks from large-scale math and code instruction datasets by filtering to instances with both correct and incorrect candidate solutions, and train 1.7B-parameter models with DAPO to reward correct selections. Across math (AIME24, AIME25, HMMT25) and code (LiveCodeBench) reasoning benchmarks, our models consistently outperform prompting and majority-voting baselines, often approaching or exceeding much larger models. Moreover, these gains generalize to selecting outputs from stronger models despite training only on outputs from weaker models. Overall, our results establish reinforcement learning as a scalable way to unlock strong generative selection in small models, enabling efficient test-time scaling.</p></details> |  |
| **[DCoPilot: Generative AI-Empowered Policy Adaptation for Dynamic Data Center Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02137v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern data centers (DCs) hosting artificial intelligence (AI)-dedicated devices operate at high power densities with rapidly varying workloads, making minute-level adaptation essential for safe and energy-efficient operation. However, manually designing piecewise deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents cannot keep pace with frequent dynamics shifts and service-level agreement (SLA) changes of an evolving DC. This specification-to-policy lag causes a lack of timely, effective control policies, which may lead to service outages. To bridge the gap, we present DCoPilot, a hybrid framework for generative control policies in dynamic DC operation. DCoPilot synergizes two distinct generative paradigms, i.e., a large language model (LLM) that performs symbolic generation of structured reward forms, and a hypernetwork that conducts parametric generation of policy weights. DCoPilot operates through three coordinated phases: (i) simulation scale-up, which stress-tests reward candidates across diverse simulation-ready (SimReady) scenes; (ii) meta policy distillation, where a hypernetwork is trained to output policy weights conditioned on SLA and scene embeddings; and (iii) online adaptation, enabling zero-shot policy generation in response to updated specifications. Evaluated across five control task families spanning diverse DC components, DCoPilot achieves near-zero constraint violations and outperforms all baselines across specification variations. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of LLM-based unified reward generation in enabling stable hypernetwork convergence.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, naive length penalties in group-relative optimization can severely hurt accuracy. We attribute this failure to two structural issues: (i) Dilution of Length Baseline, where incorrect responses (with zero length reward) depress the group baseline and over-penalize correct solutions; and (ii) Difficulty-Penalty Mismatch, where a static penalty cannot adapt to problem difficulty, suppressing necessary reasoning on hard instances while leaving redundancy on easy ones. We propose Dynamic Decoupled Conditional Advantage (DDCA) to decouple efficiency optimization from correctness. DDCA computes length advantages conditionally within the correct-response cluster to eliminate baseline dilution, and dynamically scales the penalty strength using the group pass rate as a proxy for difficulty. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, AMC23, and AIME25 show that DDCA consistently improves the efficiency--accuracy trade-off relative to adaptive baselines, reducing generated tokens by approximately 60% on simpler tasks (e.g., GSM8K) versus over 20% on harder benchmarks (e.g., AIME25), thereby maintaining or improving accuracy.

While recent years have seen significant progress, existing approaches rarely provide formal performance guarantees, which are indispensable when deploying policies in safety-critical settings. We present an approach for computing high-confidence guarantees on the performance of a multi-task policy on tasks not seen during training. Concretely, we introduce a new generalisation bound that composes (i) per-task lower confidence bounds from finitely many rollouts with (ii) task-level generalisation from finitely many sampled tasks, yielding a high-confidence guarantee for new tasks drawn from the same arbitrary and unknown distribution. Across state-of-the-art multi-task RL methods, we show that the guarantees are theoretically sound and informative at realistic sample sizes.</p></details> |  |

We find that many exploration failures arise not from problem difficulty, but from a small number of prompt tokens that introduce interference. Building on this insight, we propose the Less Noise Sampling Framework (LENS), which first prompts by identifying and removing interference tokens. then transfers successful rollouts from the purification process to supervise policy optimization on the original noisy prompts, enabling the model to learn to ignore interference in the real-world, noisy prompting settings. Experimental results show that LENS significantly outperforms GRPO, delivering higher performance and faster convergence, with a 3.88% average gain and over 1.6$\times$ speedup. Our work highlights the critical role of pruning interference tokens in improving rollout efficiency, offering a new perspective for RLVR research.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, interacting with real environments online can be risky and costly, motivating offline federated RL (FRL), where local devices learn from fixed datasets. Despite its promise, offline FRL may break down under low-quality, heterogeneous data. Offline RL tends to get stuck in local optima, and in FRL, one device's suboptimal policy can degrade the aggregated model, i.e., policy pollution. We present FORLER, combining Q-ensemble aggregation on the server with actor rectification on devices. The server robustly merges device Q-functions to curb policy pollution and shift heavy computation off resource-constrained hardware without compromising privacy. Locally, actor rectification enriches policy gradients via a zeroth-order search for high-Q actions plus a bespoke regularizer that nudges the policy toward them. A $δ$-periodic strategy further reduces local computation. We theoretically provide safe policy improvement performance guarantees. Extensive experiments show FORLER consistently outperforms strong baselines under varying data quality and heterogeneity.</p></details> | <details><summary>accet...</summary><p>accetped by IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2026)</p></details> |

Experimental evaluation on challenging coordination tasks demonstrates that our method achieves 181.8% performance improvement over no-communication baselines while reducing bandwidth usage by 41.4%. Comprehensive Pareto frontier analysis shows dominance across the entire success-bandwidth spectrum with area-under-curve of 0.198 vs 0.142 for next-best methods.

These results are typically explained by the theory that such recursion increases a networks depth, allowing it to compactly emulate the capacity of larger models. However, the performance of recursively added layers remains behind the capabilities of one pass models with the same feed forward depth. This means that in the looped version, not every recursive step effectively contributes to depth. This raises the question: when and why does latent reasoning improve performance, and when does it result in dead compute? In our work, we analyze the algorithms that latent reasoning provides answer to this question. We show that latent reasoning can be formalized as a classifier free guidance and policy improvement algorithm. Building on these insights, we propose to use a training schemes from reinforcement learning and diffusion methods for latent reasoning models. Using the Tiny Recursive Model as our testbed, we show that with our modifications we can avoid dead compute steps and reduce the total number of forward passes by 18x while maintaining performance. Broadly speaking, we show how a policy improvement perspective on recursive steps can explain model behavior and provide insights for further improvements.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we decompose the LLM-based policy into Internal Layer Policies and Internal Modular Policies via Transformer's residual stream. Our entropy analysis on internal policy reveals distinct patterns: (1) universally, policies evolve from high-entropy exploration in early layers to deterministic refinement in top layers; and (2) Qwen exhibits a progressive, human-like reasoning structure, contrasting with the abrupt final-layer convergence in Llama. Furthermore, we discover that optimizing internal layers induces feature refinement, forcing lower layers to capture high-level reasoning representations early. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), a novel RL paradigm that reconstructs the LLM's reasoning foundation from the bottom up by optimizing internal layers in early stages. Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BuPO.

While designing optimal algorithms in this performative setting has recently been studied in supervised learning, the RL counterpart remains under-explored. In this paper, we prove the performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and the policy gradient theorem in RL, and further introduce the Performative Policy Gradient algorithm (PePG). PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability.</p></details> |  |

Online prompt selection presents a plausible solution by prioritizing informative prompts to improve training efficiency. However, current methods either depend on costly, exact evaluations or construct prompt-specific predictive models lacking generalization across prompts. This study introduces Generalizable Predictive Prompt Selection (GPS), which performs Bayesian inference towards prompt difficulty using a lightweight generative model trained on the shared optimization history. Intermediate-difficulty prioritization and history-anchored diversity are incorporated into the batch acquisition principle to select informative prompt batches. The small predictive model also generalizes at test-time for efficient computational allocation. Experiments across varied reasoning benchmarks indicate GPS's substantial improvements in training efficiency, final performance, and test-time efficiency over superior baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Off-Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01962v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy learning methods seek to derive an optimal policy directly from a fixed dataset of prior interactions. This objective presents significant challenges, primarily due to the inherent distributional shift and value function overestimation bias. These issues become even more noticeable in zero-shot reinforcement learning, where an agent trained on reward-free data must adapt to new tasks at test time without additional training. In this work, we address the off-policy problem in a zero-shot setting by discovering a theoretical connection of successor measures to stationary density ratios. Using this insight, our algorithm can infer optimal importance sampling ratios, effectively performing a stationary distribution correction with an optimal policy for any task on the fly. We benchmark our method in motion tracking tasks on SMPL Humanoid, continuous control on ExoRL, and for the long-horizon OGBench tasks. Our technique seamlessly integrates into forward-backward representation frameworks and enables fast-adaptation to new tasks in a training-free regime. More broadly, this work bridges off-policy learning and zero-shot adaptation, offering benefits to both research areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extending RLVR to Open-Ended Tasks via Verifiable Multiple-Choice Reformulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02463v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards(RLVR) has demonstrated great potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, its success has thus far been largely confined to the mathematical and programming domains with clear and automatically checkable outcomes. Reinforcement learning on open-ended tasks (e.g., creative writing and subjective Q&A) continues to rely on reward models due to the absence of verifiable solutions. This raises a key question: how can we extend RLVR to strengthen reasoning in open-ended tasks regardless of the absence of the unambiguous ground truth? To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice Reformulation for Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (VMR-RLVR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended data into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even in the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM performance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across seven open-ended benchmarks, our VMR-RLVR training delivers an average gain of 3.29 points over the RL with reward model.</p></details> | 8 pages |

While prior work has integrated LLMs and VLMs into various components of RL, the replay buffer, a core component for storing and reusing experiences, remains unexplored. We propose addressing this gap by leveraging VLMs to guide the prioritization of experiences in the replay buffer. Our key idea is to use a frozen, pre-trained VLM (requiring no fine-tuning) as an automated evaluator to identify and prioritize promising sub-trajectories from the agent's experiences. Across scenarios, including game-playing and robotics, spanning both discrete and continuous domains, agents trained with our proposed prioritization method achieve 11-52% higher average success rates and improve sample efficiency by 19-45% compared to previous approaches. https://esharony.me/projects/vlm-rb/</p></details> |  |
| **[Reusing Trajectories in Policy Gradients Enables Fast Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06178v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy gradient (PG) methods are a class of effective reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly when dealing with continuous control problems. They rely on fresh on-policy data, making them sample-inefficient and requiring $O(ε^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an $ε$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve efficiency is to reuse information from past iterations, such as previous gradients or trajectories, leading to off-policy PG methods. While gradient reuse has received substantial attention, leading to improved rates up to $O(ε^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories, although intuitive, remains largely unexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous theoretical evidence that reusing past off-policy trajectories can significantly accelerate PG convergence. We propose RT-PG (Reusing Trajectories - Policy Gradient), a novel algorithm that leverages a power mean-corrected multiple importance weighting estimator to effectively combine on-policy and off-policy data coming from the most recent $ω$ iterations. Through a novel analysis, we prove that RT-PG achieves a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(ε^{-2}ω^{-1})$. When reusing all available past trajectories, this leads to a rate of $\widetilde{O}(ε^{-1})$, the best known one in the literature for PG methods. We further validate our approach empirically, demonstrating its effectiveness against baselines with state-of-the-art rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proxy Target: Bridging the Gap Between Discrete Spiking Neural Networks and Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24161v3)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer low-latency and energy-efficient decision making on neuromorphic hardware, making them attractive for Reinforcement Learning (RL) in resource-constrained edge devices. However, most RL algorithms for continuous control are designed for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), particularly the target network soft update mechanism, which conflicts with the discrete and non-differentiable dynamics of spiking neurons. We show that this mismatch destabilizes SNN training and degrades performance. To bridge the gap between discrete SNNs and continuous-control algorithms, we propose a novel proxy target framework. The proxy network introduces continuous and differentiable dynamics that enable smooth target updates, stabilizing the learning process. Since the proxy operates only during training, the deployed SNN remains fully energy-efficient with no additional inference overhead. Extensive experiments on continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently improves stability and achieves up to $32\%$ higher performance across various spiking neuron models. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that enables SNNs with simple Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neurons to surpass their ANN counterparts in continuous control. This work highlights the importance of SNN-tailored RL algorithms and paves the way for neuromorphic agents that combine high performance with low power consumption.

We identify a root of this issue: the imbalanced data distribution in the pretraining corpus, which leads to a state of "low-probability truth" and "high-probability falsehood". Recent approaches, such as teaching models to say "I don't know" or post-hoc knowledge editing, either evade the problem or face catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue from its root, we propose \textbf{PretrainRL}, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning into the pretraining phase to consolidate factual knowledge. The core principle of PretrainRL is "\textbf{debiasing then learning}." It actively reshapes the model's probability distribution by down-weighting high-probability falsehoods, thereby making "room" for low-probability truths to be learned effectively. To enable this, we design an efficient negative sampling strategy to discover these high-probability falsehoods and introduce novel metrics to evaluate the model's probabilistic state concerning factual knowledge. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that PretrainRL significantly alleviates factual hallucinations and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

While memory-augmented frameworks offer a structured alternative, current systems rely on static prompting of closed-source models or suffer from ineffective training paradigms with sparse rewards. We introduce MemBuilder, a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to orchestrate multi-dimensional memory construction with attributed dense rewards. MemBuilder addresses two key challenges: (1) Sparse Trajectory-Level Rewards: we employ synthetic session-level question generation to provide dense intermediate rewards across extended trajectories; and (2) Multi-Dimensional Memory Attribution: we introduce contribution-aware gradient weighting that scales policy updates based on each component's downstream impact. Experimental results show that MemBuilder enables a 4B-parameter model to outperform state-of-the-art closed-source baselines, exhibiting strong generalization across long-term dialogue benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages (9 main + 10 appendix), 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Yet, its application to time series experiments, where policies are sequentially assigned over time, remains challenging. Existing designs suffer from two limitations: (i) they do not fully leverage the entire history for treatment allocation; (ii) they rely on strong assumptions to approximate the objective function (e.g., the mean squared error of the estimated treatment effect) for optimizing the design. We first establish an impossibility theorem showing that failure to condition on the full history leads to suboptimal designs, due to the dynamic dependencies in time series experiments. To address both limitations simultaneously, we next propose a transformer reinforcement learning (RL) approach which leverages transformers to condition allocation on the entire history and employs RL to directly optimize the MSE without relying on restrictive assumptions. Empirical evaluations on synthetic data, a publicly available dispatch simulator, and a real-world ridesharing dataset demonstrate that our proposal consistently outperforms existing designs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Durable Algorithmic Recourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22102v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide individuals with actionable recommendations that increase their chances of receiving favorable outcomes from automated decision systems (e.g., loan approvals). While prior research has emphasized robustness to model updates, considerably less attention has been given to the temporal dynamics of recourse--particularly in competitive, resource-constrained settings where recommendations shape future applicant pools. In this work, we present a novel time-aware framework for algorithmic recourse, explicitly modeling how candidate populations adapt in response to recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based recourse algorithm that captures the evolving dynamics of the environment to generate recommendations that are both feasible and valid. We design our recommendations to be durable, supporting validity over a predefined time horizon T. This durability allows individuals to confidently reapply after taking time to implement the suggested changes. Through extensive experiments in complex simulation environments, we show that our approach substantially outperforms existing baselines, offering a superior balance between feasibility and long-term validity. Together, these results underscore the importance of incorporating temporal and behavioral dynamics into the design of practical recourse systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Precision: Training-Inference Mismatch is an Optimization Problem and Simple LR Scheduling Fixes It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01826v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) for training Large Language Models is notoriously unstable. While recent studies attribute this to "training inference mismatch stemming" from inconsistent hybrid engines, standard remedies, such as Importance Sampling, might fail during extended training runs. In this work, we analyze this instability through the lens of optimization, demonstrating that gradient noise and training-inference mismatch escalate in tandem as training progresses. Meanwhile, we find that the mismatch can be effectively suppressed by shrinking the update size. Taken together, we deduce that the mismatch is not merely a static numerical discrepancy, but a dynamic failure coupled with the model's optimization. Based on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective solution: a specialized Learning Rate (LR) scheduler. Instead of pre-defined decay schedule in traditional LR scheduler, our method dynamically triggers LR decay based on response length, which we identify as a reliable early-warning signal for impending instability. Empirical evidence suggests that by reducing the learning rate as gradient noise rises, we can consistently stabilize RL training and keep the training-inference mismatch at a safe level.</p></details> |  |
| **[Glance and Focus Reinforcement for Pan-cancer Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19103v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pan-cancer screening in large-scale CT scans remains challenging for existing AI methods, primarily due to the difficulty of localizing diverse types of tiny lesions in large CT volumes. The extreme foreground-background imbalance significantly hinders models from focusing on diseased regions, while redundant focus on healthy regions not only decreases the efficiency but also increases false positives. Inspired by radiologists' glance and focus diagnostic strategy, we introduce GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework for pan-cancer screening. GF-Screen employs a Glance model to localize the diseased regions and a Focus model to precisely segment the lesions, where segmentation results of the Focus model are leveraged to reward the Glance model via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, the Glance model crops a group of sub-volumes from the entire CT volume and learns to select the sub-volumes with lesions for the Focus model to segment. Given that the selecting operation is non-differentiable for segmentation training, we propose to employ the segmentation results to reward the Glance model. To optimize the Glance model, we introduce a novel group relative learning paradigm, which employs group relative comparison to prioritize high-advantage predictions and discard low-advantage predictions within sub-volume groups, not only improving efficiency but also reducing false positives. In this way, for the first time, we effectively extend cutting-edge RL techniques to tackle the specific challenges in pan-cancer screening. Extensive experiments on 16 internal and 7 external datasets across 9 lesion types demonstrated the effectiveness of GF-Screen. Notably, GF-Screen leads the public validation leaderboard of MICCAI FLARE25 pan-cancer challenge, surpassing the FLARE24 champion solution by a large margin (+25.6% DSC and +28.2% NSD).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026.

| **[Grad2Reward: From Sparse Judgment to Dense Rewards for Improving Open-Ended LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01791v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has catalyzed significant breakthroughs in complex LLM reasoning within verifiable domains, such as mathematics and programming. Recent efforts have sought to extend this paradigm to open-ended tasks by employing LLMs-as-a-Judge to provide sequence-level rewards for policy optimization. However, these rewards are inherently sparse, failing to provide the fine-grained supervision necessary for generating complex, long-form trajectories. Furthermore, current work treats the Judge as a black-box oracle, discarding the rich intermediate feedback signals encoded in it. To address these limitations, we introduce Grad2Reward, a novel framework that extracts dense process rewards directly from the Judge's model inference process via a single backward pass. By leveraging gradient-based attribution, Grad2Reward enables precise token-level credit assignment, substantially enhancing training efficiency and reasoning quality. Additionally, Grad2Reward introduces a self-judging mechanism, allowing the policy to improve through its own evaluative signals without training specialized reward models or reliance on superior external Judges. The experiments demonstrate that policies optimized with Grad2Reward achieve outstanding performance across diverse open-ended tasks, affirming its effectiveness and broad generalizability.</p></details> |  |

Recent behavior cloning methods further leverage expressive generative models, such as diffusion models and flow matching, to represent multimodal action distributions. However, policies pretrained in this manner often exhibit limited generalization and require additional fine-tuning to achieve robust performance at deployment time. Such adaptation must preserve the global exploration benefits of pretraining while enabling rapid correction of local execution errors.We propose \emph{Residual Flow Steering} (RFS), a data-efficient reinforcement learning framework for adapting pretrained generative policies. RFS steers a pretrained flow-matching policy by jointly optimizing a residual action and a latent noise distribution, enabling complementary forms of exploration: local refinement through residual corrections and global exploration through latent-space modulation. This design allows efficient adaptation while retaining the expressive structure of the pretrained policy.We demonstrate the effectiveness of RFS on dexterous manipulation tasks, showing efficient fine-tuning both in simulation and in real-world settings when adapting pretrained base policies.Project website:https://weirdlabuw.github.io/rfs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Position: Beyond Model-Centric Prediction -- Agentic Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01776v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has traditionally been formulated as a model-centric, static, and single-pass prediction problem that maps historical observations to future values. While this paradigm has driven substantial progress, it proves insufficient in adaptive and multi-turn settings where forecasting requires informative feature extraction, reasoning-driven inference, iterative refinement, and continual adaptation over time. In this paper, we argue for agentic time series forecasting (ATSF), which reframes forecasting as an agentic process composed of perception, planning, action, reflection, and memory. Rather than focusing solely on predictive models, ATSF emphasizes organizing forecasting as an agentic workflow that can interact with tools, incorporate feedback from outcomes, and evolve through experience accumulation. We outline three representative implementation paradigms -- workflow-based design, agentic reinforcement learning, and a hybrid agentic workflow paradigm -- and discuss the opportunities and challenges that arise when shifting from model-centric prediction to agentic forecasting. Together, this position aims to establish agentic forecasting as a foundation for future research at the intersection of time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frictional Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19771v3)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy reinforcement learning suffers from extrapolation errors when a learned policy selects actions that are weakly supported in the replay buffer. In this study, we address this issue by drawing an analogy to static friction in classical mechanics. From this perspective, the replay buffer is represented as a smooth, low-dimensional action manifold, where the support directions correspond to the tangential component, while the normal component captures the dominant first-order extrapolation error. This decomposition reveals an intrinsic anisotropy in value sensitivity that naturally induces a stability condition analogous to a friction threshold. To mitigate deviations toward unsupported actions, we propose Frictional Q-Learning, an off-policy algorithm that encodes supported actions as tangent directions using a contrastive variational autoencoder. We further show that an orthonormal basis of the orthogonal complement corresponds to normal components under mild local isometry assumptions. Empirical results on standard continuous-control benchmarks demonstrate robust, stable performance compared with existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Gait Driven Reinforcement Learning Framework for Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08416v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a real-time gait driven training framework for humanoid robots. First, we introduce a novel gait planner that incorporates dynamics to design the desired joint trajectory. In the gait design process, the 3D robot model is decoupled into two 2D models, which are then approximated as hybrid inverted pendulums (H-LIP) for trajectory planning. The gait planner operates in parallel in real time within the robot's learning environment. Second, based on this gait planner, we design three effective reward functions within a reinforcement learning framework, forming a reward composition to achieve periodic bipedal gait. This reward composition reduces the robot's learning time and enhances locomotion performance. Finally, a gait design example, along with simulation and experimental comparisons, is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Reward Auditing for Active Detection and Mitigation of Reward Hacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01750v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where models exploit spurious correlations in learned reward models to achieve high scores while violating human intent. Existing mitigations rely on static defenses that cannot adapt to novel exploitation strategies. We propose Adversarial Reward Auditing (ARA), a framework that reconceptualizes reward hacking as a dynamic, competitive game. ARA operates in two stages: first, a Hacker policy discovers reward model vulnerabilities while an Auditor learns to detect exploitation from latent representations; second, Auditor-Guided RLHF (AG-RLHF) gates reward signals to penalize detected hacking, transforming reward hacking from an unobservable failure into a measurable, controllable signal. Experiments across three hacking scenarios demonstrate that ARA achieves the best alignment-utility tradeoff among all baselines: reducing sycophancy to near-SFT levels while improving helpfulness, decreasing verbosity while achieving the highest ROUGE-L, and suppressing code gaming while improving Pass@1. Beyond single-domain evaluation, we show that reward hacking, detection, and mitigation all generalize across domains -- a Hacker trained on code gaming exhibits increased sycophancy despite no reward for this behavior, and an Auditor trained on one domain effectively suppresses exploitation in others, enabling efficient multi-domain defense with a single model.</p></details> |  |

We propose CURA-PPO, a reinforcement learning framework that addresses this challenge by explicitly modeling uncertainty under partial observability. By predicting collision possibility as a distribution, we extract both risk and uncertainty to guide the robot's actions. The uncertainty term encourages active perception, enabling simultaneous manipulation and information gathering to resolve occlusions. When combined with confidence maps that capture observation reliability, our approach enables safe navigation despite severe sensor occlusion. Extensive experiments across varying object sizes and obstacle configurations demonstrate that CURA-PPO achieves up to 3X higher success rates than the baselines, with learned behaviors that handle occlusions. Our method provides a practical solution for autonomous manipulation in cluttered environments using only onboard sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, Accepted to ICRA 2026, Webpage: https://jiw0o.github.io/cura-ppo/</p></details> |

To mitigate this issue, we propose Latent Diffusion Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning (LaDi-RL), a framework that conducts exploration directly in a continuous latent space, where latent variables encode semantic-level reasoning trajectories. By modeling exploration via guided diffusion, multi-step denoising distributes stochasticity and preserves multiple coexisting solution modes without mutual suppression. Furthermore, by decoupling latent-space exploration from text-space generation, we show that latent diffusion-based optimization is more effective than text-space policy optimization alone, while a complementary text policy provides additional gains when combined with latent exploration. Experiments on code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both pass@1 and pass@k over discrete RL baselines, with absolute pass@1 gains of +9.4% on code generation and +5.7% on mathematical reasoning, highlighting diffusion-based latent RL as a principled alternative to discrete token-level RL for reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Existing mitigations remain largely technical and system-centric: tracking capability in advanced systems, shaping behaviour through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, and designing systems to be corrigible and interruptible. Here we develop instrumental goal trajectories to expand these options beyond the model. Gaining capability typically depends on access to additional technical resources, such as compute, storage, data and adjacent services, which in turn requires access to monetary resources. In organisations, these resources can be obtained through three organisational pathways. We label these pathways the procurement, governance and finance instrumental goal trajectories (IGTs). Each IGT produces a trail of organisational artefacts that can be monitored and used as intervention points when a systems capabilities or behaviour exceed acceptable thresholds. In this way, IGTs offer concrete avenues for defining capability levels and for broadening how corrigibility and interruptibility are implemented, shifting attention from model properties alone to the organisational systems that enable them.</p></details> |  |

However, we show that modern reasoning post-training induces an unintended exploration collapse: temperature-based sampling no longer increases pass@$n$ accuracy. Empirically, the final-layer posterior of post-trained LRMs exhibit sharply reduced entropy, while the entropy of intermediate layers remains relatively high. Motivated by this entropy asymmetry, we propose Latent Exploration Decoding (LED), a depth-conditioned decoding strategy. LED aggregates intermediate posteriors via cumulative sum and selects depth configurations with maximal entropy as exploration candidates. Without additional training or parameters, LED consistently improves pass@1 and pass@16 accuracy by 0.61 and 1.03 percentage points across multiple reasoning benchmarks and models.

In this method, LLM policies are generally optimized through reward maximization with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization of the reference policy. However, KL and its $f$-divergence variants only compare token probabilities at identical indices, failing to capture semantic similarity. We propose Wasserstein Policy Regularization (WPR), a semantic-aware regularization for the RLHF framework based on the entropy-regularized Wasserstein distance, which incorporates the geometry of the token space. The dual formulation of the distance expresses the regularization as penalty terms applied to the reward via optimal dual variables, which yield a tractable objective compatible with standard RL algorithms. Empirically, our method outperforms KL- and $f$-divergence-based baselines, demonstrating the benefits of semantic-aware policy distances for alignment.

A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning, which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H, STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong generalization.

To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{TRIP-Bench}, a long-horizon benchmark grounded in realistic travel-planning scenarios. TRIP-Bench leverages real-world data, offers 18 curated tools and 40+ travel requirements, and supports automated evaluation. It includes splits of varying difficulty; the hard split emphasizes long and ambiguous interactions, style shifts, feasibility changes, and iterative version revision. Dialogues span up to 15 user turns, can involve 150+ tool calls, and may exceed 200k tokens of context. Experiments show that even advanced models achieve at most 50\% success on the easy split, with performance dropping below 10\% on hard subsets. We further propose \textbf{GTPO}, an online multi-turn reinforcement learning method with specialized reward normalization and reward differencing. Applied to Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GTPO improves constraint satisfaction and interaction robustness, outperforming Gemini-3-Pro in our evaluation. We expect TRIP-Bench to advance practical long-horizon interactive agents, and GTPO to provide an effective online RL recipe for robust long-horizon training.</p></details> | 40 pages, 6figures |

Existing approaches rely on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL), which provides limited guidance for regulating information acquisition. We propose DeepControl, a framework for adaptive information control based on a formal notion of information utility, which measures the marginal value of retrieved evidence under a given reasoning state. Building on this utility, we introduce retrieval continuation and granularity control mechanisms that selectively regulate when to continue and stop retrieval, and how much information to expand. An annealed control strategy enables the agent to internalize effective information acquisition behaviors during training. Extensive experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines. In particular, our approach achieves average performance improvements of 9.4% and 8.6% on Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-3B, respectively, over strong outcome-based RL baselines, and consistently outperforms both retrieval-free and retrieval-based reasoning methods without explicit information control. These results highlight the importance of adaptive information control for scaling search-augmented reasoning agents to complex, real-world information environments.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, existing workflow orchestration still faces key challenges, including high manual cost, reliance on specific operators/large language models (LLMs), and sparse reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose FlowSteer, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that takes a lightweight policy model as the agent and an executable canvas environment, automating workflow orchestration through multi-turn interaction. In this process, the policy model analyzes execution states and selects editing actions, while the canvas executes operators and returns feedback for iterative refinement. Moreover, FlowSteer provides a plug-and-play framework that supports diverse operator libraries and interchangeable LLM backends. To effectively train this interaction paradigm, we propose Canvas Workflow Relative Policy Optimization (CWRPO), which introduces diversity-constrained rewards with conditional release to stabilize learning and suppress shortcut behaviors. Experimental results on twelve datasets show that FlowSteer significantly outperforms baselines across various tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables.

However, the redundancy of video tokens introduces significant computational overhead during inference, limiting their practical deployment. Many compression algorithms are proposed to prioritize retaining features with the highest attention scores to minimize perturbations in attention computations. However, the correlation between attention scores and their actual contribution to correct answers remains ambiguous. To address the above limitation, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontribution-\textbf{a}ware token \textbf{Co}mpression algorithm for \textbf{VID}eo understanding (\textbf{CaCoVID}) that explicitly optimizes the token selection policy based on the contribution of tokens to correct predictions. First, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework that optimizes a policy network to select video token combinations with the greatest contribution to correct predictions. This paradigm shifts the focus from passive token preservation to active discovery of optimal compressed token combinations. Secondly, we propose a combinatorial policy optimization algorithm with online combination space sampling, which dramatically reduces the exploration space for video token combinations and accelerates the convergence speed of policy optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of CaCoVID.

Reward-based post-training has emerged as a promising direction to improve the quality and semantic alignment of generated videos. However, recent methods either rely on large-scale human preference annotations or operate on misaligned embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models, leading to limited scalability or suboptimal supervision. We present $\texttt{PISCES}$, an annotation-free post-training algorithm that addresses these limitations via a novel Dual Optimal Transport (OT)-aligned Rewards module. To align reward signals with human judgment, $\texttt{PISCES}$ uses OT to bridge text and video embeddings at both distributional and discrete token levels, enabling reward supervision to fulfill two objectives: (i) a Distributional OT-aligned Quality Reward that captures overall visual quality and temporal coherence; and (ii) a Discrete Token-level OT-aligned Semantic Reward that enforces semantic, spatio-temporal correspondence between text and video tokens. To our knowledge, $\texttt{PISCES}$ is the first to improve annotation-free reward supervision in generative post-training through the lens of OT. Experiments on both short- and long-video generation show that $\texttt{PISCES}$ outperforms both annotation-based and annotation-free methods on VBench across Quality and Semantic scores, with human preference studies further validating its effectiveness. We show that the Dual OT-aligned Rewards module is compatible with multiple optimization paradigms, including direct backpropagation and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

One of the most common USD approaches is to maximize the Mutual Information (MI) between skill latent variables and states. However, MI-based methods tend to favor simple, static skills due to their invariance properties, limiting the discovery of dynamic, task-relevant behaviors. Distance-Maximizing Skill Discovery (DSD) promotes more dynamic skills by leveraging state-space distances, yet still fall short in encouraging comprehensive skill sets that engage all controllable factors or entities in the environment. In this work, we introduce SUSD, a novel framework that harnesses the compositional structure of environments by factorizing the state space into independent components (e.g., objects or controllable entities). SUSD allocates distinct skill variables to different factors, enabling more fine-grained control on the skill discovery process. A dynamic model also tracks learning across factors, adaptively steering the agent's focus toward underexplored factors. This structured approach not only promotes the discovery of richer and more diverse skills, but also yields a factorized skill representation that enables fine-grained and disentangled control over individual entities which facilitates efficient training of compositional downstream tasks via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). Our experimental results across three environments, with factors ranging from 1 to 10, demonstrate that our method can discover diverse and complex skills without supervision, significantly outperforming existing unsupervised skill discovery methods in factorized and complex environments.

| **[Revolutionizing Genomics with Reinforcement Learning Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13268v7)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems, including decision-making and genomics. The exponential growth of raw genomic data over the past two decades has exceeded the capacity of manual analysis, leading to a growing interest in automatic data analysis and processing. RL algorithms are capable of learning from experience with minimal human supervision, making them well-suited for genomic data analysis and interpretation. One of the key benefits of using RL is the reduced cost associated with collecting labeled training data, which is required for supervised learning. While there have been numerous studies examining the applications of Machine Learning (ML) in genomics, this survey focuses exclusively on the use of RL in various genomics research fields, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs), genome assembly, and sequence alignment. We present a comprehensive technical overview of existing studies on the application of RL in genomics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of these approaches. We then discuss potential research directions that are worthy of future exploration, including the development of more sophisticated reward functions as RL heavily depends on the accuracy of the reward function, the integration of RL with other machine learning techniques, and the application of RL to new and emerging areas in genomics research. Finally, we present our findings and conclude by summarizing the current state of the field and the future outlook for RL in genomics.</p></details> |  |

Flow Matching (FM) enables one-step generation, but integrating it into Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) is challenging: the optimal policy is an intractable energy-based distribution, and the efficient log-likelihood estimation required to balance exploration and exploitation suffers from severe discretization bias. We propose \textbf{F}low-based \textbf{L}og-likelihood-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}aximum \textbf{E}ntropy RL (\textbf{FLAME}), a principled framework that addresses these challenges. First, we derive a Q-Reweighted FM objective that bypasses partition function estimation via importance reweighting. Second, we design a decoupled entropy estimator that rigorously corrects bias, which enables efficient exploration and brings the policy closer to the optimal MaxEnt policy. Third, we integrate the MeanFlow formulation to achieve expressive and efficient one-step control. Empirical results on MuJoCo show that FLAME outperforms Gaussian baselines and matches multi-step diffusion policies with significantly lower inference cost.

| **[Adaptive Rollout Allocation for Online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01601v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling efficiency is a key bottleneck in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GRPO, allocate a fixed number of rollouts for all training prompts. This uniform allocation implicitly treats all prompts as equally informative, and could lead to inefficient computational budget usage and impede training progress. We introduce \Ours, a Variance-Informed Predictive allocation strategy that allocates a given rollout budget to the prompts in the incumbent batch to minimize the expected gradient variance of the policy update. At each iteration, \Ours~uses a lightweight Gaussian process model to predict per-prompt success probabilities based on recent rollouts. These probability predictions are translated into variance estimates, which are then fed into a convex optimization problem to determine the optimal rollout allocations under a hard compute budget constraint. Empirical results show that \Ours~consistently improves sampling efficiency and achieves higher performance than uniform or heuristic allocation strategies in multiple benchmarks. Our code will be available at https://github.com/HieuNT91/VIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[The Multiple Ticket Hypothesis: Random Sparse Subnetworks Suffice for RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01599v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis demonstrated that sparse subnetworks can match full-model performance, suggesting parameter redundancy. Meanwhile, in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), recent work has shown that updates concentrate on a sparse subset of parameters, which further lends evidence to this underlying redundancy. We study the simplest possible way to exploit this redundancy: training only a randomly selected subset of parameters at extreme sparsities. Empirically, we find that training just 1\% of parameters matches or exceeds full-parameter RLVR finetuning across 3 models and 2 task domains. Moreover, different random masks show minimal overlap ($\leq 0.005$ Jaccard similarity) and yet all succeed, suggesting pretrained models contain many viable sparse subnetworks rather than one privileged set. We term this the Multiple Ticket Hypothesis. We explain this phenomenon through the implicit per-step KL constraint in RLVR, which restricts updates to a low-dimensional subspace, enabling arbitrary sparse masks to succeed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Know Your Step: Faster and Better Alignment for Flow Matching Models via Step-aware Advantages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01591v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in flow matching models, particularly with reinforcement learning (RL), have significantly enhanced human preference alignment in few step text to image generators. However, existing RL based approaches for flow matching models typically rely on numerous denoising steps, while suffering from sparse and imprecise reward signals that often lead to suboptimal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Temperature Annealed Few step Sampling with Group Relative Policy Optimization (TAFS GRPO), a novel framework for training flow matching text to image models into efficient few step generators well aligned with human preferences. Our method iteratively injects adaptive temporal noise onto the results of one step samples. By repeatedly annealing the model's sampled outputs, it introduces stochasticity into the sampling process while preserving the semantic integrity of each generated image. Moreover, its step aware advantage integration mechanism combines the GRPO to avoid the need for the differentiable of reward function and provide dense and step specific rewards for stable policy optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAFS GRPO achieves strong performance in few step text to image generation and significantly improves the alignment of generated images with human preferences. The code and models of this work will be available to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Context-aware Reasoning-enhanced Generative Searching in E-commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16925v3)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Search-based recommendation is one of the most critical application scenarios in e-commerce platforms. Users' complex search contexts--such as spatiotemporal factors, historical interactions, and current query's information--constitute an essential part of their decision-making, reflecting implicit preferences that complement explicit query terms. Modeling such rich contextual signals and their intricate associations with candidate items remains a key challenge. Although numerous efforts have been devoted to building more effective search methods, existing approaches still show limitations in integrating contextual information, which hinders their ability to fully capture user intent. To address these challenges, we propose a context-aware reasoning-enhanced generative search framework for better \textbf{understanding the complicated context}. Specifically, the framework first unifies heterogeneous user and item contexts into textual representations or text-based semantic identifiers and aligns them. To overcome the lack of explicit reasoning trajectories, we introduce a self-evolving post-training paradigm that iteratively combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to progressively enhance the model's reasoning capability. In addition, we identify potential biases in existing RL algorithms when applied to search scenarios and present a debiased variant of GRPO to improve ranking performance. Extensive experiments on search log data collected from a real-world e-commerce platform demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared with strong baselines, validating its effectiveness for search-based recommendation.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW'26 |
| **[AdNanny: One Reasoning LLM for All Offline Ads Recommendation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01563v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in Natural Language Understanding and Generation, but deploying them directly in online advertising systems is often impractical due to strict millisecond-level latency constraints. This has motivated the use of LLMs offline to improve retrieval, ranking, and recommendation models. Existing solutions typically fine-tune separate LLMs for individual tasks such as query-ad relevance labeling, keyword-based query generation, and user profiling. This results in redundant models, high maintenance cost, and limited performance gains despite substantial overlap in domain knowledge and reasoning patterns. We introduce AdNanny, a unified reasoning-centric LLM that serves as a shared backbone for offline advertising tasks. AdNanny is obtained by fine-tuning a public 671B-parameter DeepSeek-R1 checkpoint using a scalable training system that supports hybrid dense-MoE parallelism. We construct reasoning-augmented corpora that pair structured supervision with step-by-step natural language explanations. A multi-task supervised fine-tuning stage with adaptive reweighting enables AdNanny to handle diverse labeling and generation tasks in a consistent reasoning format. This is followed by reinforcement learning using downstream advertising metrics to align model behavior with online retrieval and ranking objectives. AdNanny is deployed in production within Bing Ads, where it significantly reduces manual labeling effort and improves accuracy across multiple offline tasks. By consolidating many task-specific models into a single reasoning-centric foundation model, AdNanny provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for large-scale advertising systems.</p></details> | 21 pages, 3 figures |
| **[COBRA++: Enhanced COBRA Optimizer with Augmented Surrogate Pool and Reinforced Surrogate Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22624v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimization problems in realistic world present significant challenges onto optimization algorithms, such as the expensive evaluation issue and complex constraint conditions. COBRA optimizer (including its up-to-date variants) is a representative and effective tool for addressing such optimization problems, which introduces 1) RBF surrogate to reduce online evaluation and 2) bi-stage optimization process to alternate search for feasible solution and optimal solution. Though promising, its design space, i.e., surrogate model pool and selection standard, is still manually decided by human expert, resulting in labor-intensive fine-tuning for novel tasks. In this paper, we propose a learning-based adaptive strategy (COBRA++) that enhances COBRA in two aspects: 1) An augmented surrogate pool to break the tie with RBF-like surrogate and hence enhances model diversity and approximation capability; 2) A reinforcement learning-based online model selection policy that empowers efficient and accurate optimization process. The model selection policy is trained to maximize overall performance of COBRA++ across a distribution of constrained optimization problems with diverse properties. We have conducted multi-dimensional validation experiments and demonstrate that COBRA++ achieves substantial performance improvement against vanilla COBRA and its adaptive variant. Ablation studies are provided to support correctness of each design component in COBRA++.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Cognitive Supersensing in Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01541v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in open-vocabulary perceptual tasks, yet their ability to solve complex cognitive problems remains limited, especially when visual details are abstract and require visual memory. Current approaches primarily scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the text space, even when language alone is insufficient for clear and structured reasoning, and largely neglect visual reasoning mechanisms analogous to the human visuospatial sketchpad and visual imagery. To mitigate this deficiency, we introduce Cognitive Supersensing, a novel training paradigm that endows MLLMs with human-like visual imagery capabilities by integrating a Latent Visual Imagery Prediction (LVIP) head that jointly learns sequences of visual cognitive latent embeddings and aligns them with the answer, thereby forming vision-based internal reasoning chains. We further introduce a reinforcement learning stage that optimizes text reasoning paths based on this grounded visual latent. To evaluate the cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, we present CogSense-Bench, a comprehensive visual question answering (VQA) benchmark assessing five cognitive dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLLMs trained with Cognitive Supersensing significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines on CogSense-Bench and exhibit superior generalization on out-of-domain mathematics and science VQA benchmarks, suggesting that internal visual imagery is potentially key to bridging the gap between perceptual recognition and cognitive understanding. We will open-source the CogSense-Bench and our model weights.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAGIC: A Co-Evolving Attacker-Defender Adversarial Game for Robust LLM Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01539v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring robust safety alignment is crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet existing defenses often lag behind evolving adversarial attacks due to their \textbf{reliance on static, pre-collected data distributions}. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{MAGIC}, a novel multi-turn multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that formulates LLM safety alignment as an adversarial asymmetric game. Specifically, an attacker agent learns to iteratively rewrite original queries into deceptive prompts, while a defender agent simultaneously optimizes its policy to recognize and refuse such inputs. This dynamic process triggers a \textbf{co-evolution}, where the attacker's ever-changing strategies continuously uncover long-tail vulnerabilities, driving the defender to generalize to unseen attack patterns. Remarkably, we observe that the attacker, endowed with initial reasoning ability, evolves \textbf{novel, previously unseen combinatorial strategies} through iterative RL training, underscoring our method's substantial potential. Theoretically, we provide insights into a more robust game equilibrium and derive safety guarantees. Extensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating superior defense success rates without compromising the helpfulness of the model.

| **[Making Bias Non-Predictive: Training Robust LLM Judges via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01528v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated judges, yet they remain susceptible to cognitive biases -- often altering their reasoning when faced with spurious prompt-level cues such as consensus claims or authority appeals. Existing mitigations via prompting or supervised fine-tuning fail to generalize, as they modify surface behavior without changing the optimization objective that makes bias cues predictive. To address this gap, we propose Epistemic Independence Training (EIT), a reinforcement learning framework grounded in a key principle: to learn independence, bias cues must be made non-predictive of reward. EIT operationalizes this through a balanced conflict strategy where bias signals are equally likely to support correct and incorrect answers, combined with a reward design that penalizes bias-following without rewarding bias agreement. Experiments on Qwen3-4B demonstrate that EIT improves both accuracy and robustness under adversarial biases, while preserving performance when bias aligns with truth. Notably, models trained only on bandwagon bias generalize to unseen bias types such as authority and distraction, indicating that EIT induces transferable epistemic independence rather than bias-specific heuristics.

| **[A Relative-Budget Theory for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards in Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01523v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a dominant paradigm for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet its effectiveness varies across tasks and compute budgets. We propose a \emph{relative-budget} theory explaining this variation through a single quantity called relative budget $ξ:= H/\mathbb{E}[T]$, where $H$ is the generation horizon (token budget) and $T$ denotes the number of tokens until the first correct solution under a base policy. We show that $ξ$ determines sample efficiency by controlling reward variance and the likelihood of informative trajectories. Our analysis reveals three regimes: in the \emph{deficient} regime ($ξ\to 0$), informative trajectories are rare and the sample complexity explodes; in the \emph{balanced} regime ($ξ=Θ(1)$), informative trajectories occur with non-negligible probability and RL is maximally sample-efficient; and in the \emph{ample} regime ($ξ\to \infty$), learning remains stable but marginal gains per iteration diminish. We further provide finite-sample guarantees for online RL that characterize learning progress across these regimes. Specifically, in a case study under idealized distributional assumptions, we show that the relative budget grows linearly over iterations. Our empirical results confirm these predictions in realistic settings, identifying a budget $ξ\in [1.5, 2.0]$ that maximizes learning efficiency and coincides with peak reasoning performance.</p></details> | 28 pages |

To address this limitation, we propose Rubric-ARM, a framework that jointly optimizes a rubric generator and a judge using reinforcement learning from preference feedback. Unlike existing methods that rely on static rubrics or disjoint training pipelines, our approach treats rubric generation as a latent action learned to maximize judgment accuracy. We introduce an alternating optimization strategy to mitigate the non-stationarity of simultaneous updates, providing theoretical analysis that demonstrates how this schedule reduces gradient variance during training. Extensive experiments show that Rubric-ARM achieves state-of-the-art performance among baselines on multiple benchmarks and significantly improves downstream policy alignment in both offline and online reinforcement learning settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

In this paper, we study building blocks for self-supervised RL that unlock substantial improvements in scalability, with network depth serving as a critical factor. Whereas most RL papers in recent years have relied on shallow architectures (around 2 - 5 layers), we demonstrate that increasing the depth up to 1024 layers can significantly boost performance. Our experiments are conducted in an unsupervised goal-conditioned setting, where no demonstrations or rewards are provided, so an agent must explore (from scratch) and learn how to maximize the likelihood of reaching commanded goals. Evaluated on simulated locomotion and manipulation tasks, our approach increases performance on the self-supervised contrastive RL algorithm by $2\times$ - $50\times$, outperforming other goal-conditioned baselines. Increasing the model depth not only increases success rates but also qualitatively changes the behaviors learned.

We identify a reproducible inference-time phenomenon, termed Self-Compression: when multiple independent and answerable questions are presented within a single prompt, the model spontaneously produces shorter reasoning traces for each question. This phenomenon arises from multi-question contextual pressure during generation and consistently manifests across models and benchmarks. Building on this observation, we propose ConPress (Learning from Contextual Pressure), a lightweight self-supervised fine-tuning approach. ConPress constructs multi-question prompts to induce self-compression, samples the resulting model outputs, and parses and filters per-question traces to obtain concise yet correct reasoning trajectories. These trajectories are directly used for supervised fine-tuning, internalizing compressed reasoning behavior in single-question settings without external teachers, manual pruning, or reinforcement learning. With only 8k fine-tuning examples, ConPress reduces reasoning token usage by 59% on MATH500 and 33% on AIME25, while maintaining competitive accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Uniform Noise-to-Signal Ratio in the REINFORCE Policy-Gradient Estimator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01460v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy-gradient methods are widely used in reinforcement learning, yet training often becomes unstable or slows down as learning progresses. We study this phenomenon through the noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) of a policy-gradient estimator, defined as the estimator variance (noise) normalized by the squared norm of the true gradient (signal). Our main result is that, for (i) finite-horizon linear systems with Gaussian policies and linear state-feedback, and (ii) finite-horizon polynomial systems with Gaussian policies and polynomial feedback, the NSR of the REINFORCE estimator can be characterized exactly-either in closed form or via numerical moment-evaluation algorithms-without approximation. For general nonlinear dynamics and expressive policies (including neural policies), we further derive a general upper bound on the variance. These characterizations enable a direct examination of how NSR varies across policy parameters and how it evolves along optimization trajectories (e.g. SGD and Adam). Across a range of examples, we find that the NSR landscape is highly non-uniform and typically increases as the policy approaches an optimum; in some regimes it blows up, which can trigger training instability and policy collapse.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provable Cooperative Multi-Agent Exploration for Reward-Free MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01453v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning in the setting of reward-free exploration, where multiple agents jointly explore an unknown MDP in order to learn its dynamics (without observing rewards). We focus on a tabular finite-horizon MDP and adopt a phased learning framework. In each learning phase, multiple agents independently interact with the environment. More specifically, in each learning phase, each agent is assigned a policy, executes it, and observes the resulting trajectory. Our primary goal is to characterize the tradeoff between the number of learning phases and the number of agents, especially when the number of learning phases is small. Our results identify a sharp transition governed by the horizon $H$. When the number of learning phases equals $H$, we present a computationally efficient algorithm that uses only $\tilde{O}(S^6 H^6 A / ε^2)$ agents to obtain an $ε$ approximation of the dynamics (i.e., yields an $ε$-optimal policy for any reward function). We complement our algorithm with a lower bound showing that any algorithm restricted to $ρ< H$ phases requires at least $A^{H/ρ}$ agents to achieve constant accuracy. Thus, we show that it is essential to have an order of $H$ learning phases if we limit the number of agents to be polynomial.</p></details> |  |
| **[TQL: Scaling Q-Functions with Transformers by Preventing Attention Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01439v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite scale driving substantial recent advancements in machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL) methods still primarily use small value functions. Naively scaling value functions -- including with a transformer architecture, which is known to be highly scalable -- often results in learning instability and worse performance. In this work, we ask what prevents transformers from scaling effectively for value functions? Through empirical analysis, we identify the critical failure mode in this scaling: attention scores collapse as capacity increases. Our key insight is that we can effectively prevent this collapse and stabilize training by controlling the entropy of the attention scores, thereby enabling the use of larger models. To this end, we propose Transformer Q-Learning (TQL), a method that unlocks the scaling potential of transformers in learning value functions in RL. Our approach yields up to a 43% improvement in performance when scaling from the smallest to the largest network sizes, while prior methods suffer from performance degradation.</p></details> |  |

BMG-Q advances ride-pooling decision-making process with the localized bipartite match graph underlying the Markov Decision Process, enabling the development of novel Graph Attention Double Deep Q Network (GATDDQN) as the MARL backbone to capture the dynamic interactions among ride-pooling vehicles in fleet. Our approach enriches the state information for each agent with GATDDQN by leveraging a localized bipartite interdependence graph and enables a centralized global coordinator to optimize order matching and agent behavior using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Enhanced by gradient clipping and localized graph sampling, our GATDDQN improves scalability and robustness. Furthermore, the inclusion of a posterior score function in the ILP captures the online exploration-exploitation trade-off and reduces the potential overestimation bias of agents, thereby elevating the quality of the derived solutions. Through extensive experiments and validation, BMG-Q has demonstrated superior performance in both training and operations for thousands of vehicle agents, outperforming benchmark reinforcement learning frameworks by around 10% in accumulative rewards and showing a significant reduction in overestimation bias by over 50%. Additionally, it maintains robustness amidst task variations and fleet size changes, establishing BMG-Q as an effective, scalable, and robust framework for advancing ride-pooling order dispatch operations.</p></details> |  |

In finance, DRL is commonly used either to generate discrete trade signals or to determine continuous portfolio allocations. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework for portfolio optimization that incorporates Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) into several DRL algorithms. The approach replaces conventional multilayer perceptrons with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in both actor and critic components-utilizing learnable B-spline univariate functions to achieve parameter-efficient and more interpretable function approximation. During actor updates, we introduce a physics-informed regularization loss that promotes second-order temporal consistency between observed return dynamics and the action-induced portfolio adjustments. The proposed framework is evaluated across three equity markets-China, Vietnam, and the United States, covering both emerging and developed economies. Across all three markets, PIKAN-based agents consistently deliver higher cumulative and annualized returns, superior Sharpe and Calmar ratios, and more favorable drawdown characteristics compared to both standard DRL baselines and classical online portfolio-selection methods. This yields more stable training, higher Sharpe ratios, and superior performance compared to traditional DRL counterparts. The approach is particularly valuable in highly dynamic and noisy financial markets, where conventional DRL often suffers from instability and poor generalization.</p></details> |  |

This enables a single model to flexibly adapt to arbitrary trade-offs at run-time by producing a policy on or near the Pareto front. However, existing benchmarks for PCPL are largely restricted to toy tasks and fixed environments, limiting their realism and scalability. To address this gap, we introduce GraphAllocBench, a flexible benchmark built on a novel graph-based resource allocation sandbox environment inspired by city management, which we call CityPlannerEnv. GraphAllocBench provides a rich suite of problems with diverse objective functions, varying preference conditions, and high-dimensional scalability. We also propose two new evaluation metrics -- Proportion of Non-Dominated Solutions (PNDS) and Ordering Score (OS) -- that directly capture preference consistency while complementing the widely used hypervolume metric. Through experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and graph-aware models, we show that GraphAllocBench exposes the limitations of existing MORL approaches and paves the way for using graph-based methods such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in complex, high-dimensional combinatorial allocation tasks. Beyond its predefined problem set, GraphAllocBench enables users to flexibly vary objectives, preferences, and allocation rules, establishing it as a versatile and extensible benchmark for advancing PCPL.

In this research, we show that current RL pipelines for FMs suffer from two underappreciated yet important limitations: sample inefficiency due to insufficient generation diversity, and pronounced prompt overfitting, where models memorize specific training formulations and exhibit dramatic performance collapse when evaluated on semantically equivalent but stylistically varied prompts. We present PromptRL (Prompt Matters in RL for Flow-Based Image Generation), a framework that incorporates language models (LMs) as trainable prompt refinement agents directly within the flow-based RL optimization loop. This design yields two complementary benefits: rapid development of sophisticated prompt rewriting capabilities and, critically, a synergistic training regime that reshapes the optimization dynamics. PromptRL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, obtaining scores of 0.97 on GenEval, 0.98 on OCR accuracy, and 24.05 on PickScore. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our RL approach on large-scale image editing models, improving the EditReward of FLUX.1-Kontext from 1.19 to 1.43 with only 0.06 million rollouts, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (also known as Nano Banana), which scores 1.37, and achieving comparable performance with ReasonNet (1.44), which relied on fine-grained data annotations along with a complex multi-stage training. Our extensive experiments empirically demonstrate that PromptRL consistently achieves higher performance ceilings while requiring over 2$\times$ fewer rollouts compared to naive flow-only RL.

| **[When Domains Interact: Asymmetric and Order-Sensitive Cross-Domain Effects in Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01365v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has become a key technique for improving reasoning abilities in large language models, yet its behavior under different domain sequencing strategies is poorly understood. In particular, the impact of sequential (one domain at a time) versus mixed-domain (multiple domain at a time) training in GRPO has not been systematically studied. We provide the first systematic analysis of training-order effects across math, science, logic, and puzzle reasoning tasks. We found (1) single-domain generalization is highly asymmetric: training on other domains improves math reasoning by approximately 25\% accuracy, while yielding negligible transfer to logic and puzzle; (2) cross-domain interactions are highly order-dependent: training in the order math$\rightarrow$science achieves 83\% / 41\% accuracy on math / science, while reversing the order to science$\rightarrow$math degrades performance to 77\% / 25\%; (3) no single strategy is universally optimal in multi-domain training: sequential training favors math (up to 84\%), mixed training favors science and logic, and poor ordering can incur large performance gaps (from 70\% to 56\%). Overall, our findings demonstrate that GRPO under multi-domain settings exhibits pronounced asymmetry, order sensitivity, and strategy dependence, highlighting the necessity of domain-aware and order-aware training design.</p></details> |  |

Recent work mainly focused on improving answer accuracy via fine-tuning and structured or reinforcement-based optimization. However, reliable reasoning in response generation faces three challenges: 1) Reasoning Collapse. Reasoning in multi-hop QA is inherently complex due to multi-hop composition and is further destabilized by noisy retrieval. 2) Reasoning-answer inconsistency. Due to the intrinsic uncertainty of LLM generation and exposure to evidence--distractor mixtures, models may produce correct answers that are not faithfully supported by their intermediate reasoning or evidence. 3) Loss of format control. Traditional chain-of-thought generation often deviates from required structured output formats, leading to incomplete or malformed structured content. To address these challenges, we propose CRAFT (Calibrated Reasoning with Answer-Faithful Traces), a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement learning framework that trains models to perform faithful reasoning during response generation. CRAFT employs dual reward mechanisms to optimize multi-hop reasoning: deterministic rewards ensure structural correctness while judge-based rewards verify semantic faithfulness. This optimization framework supports controllable trace variants that enable systematic analysis of how structure and scale affect reasoning performance and faithfulness. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks show that CRAFT improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness across model scales, with the CRAFT 7B model achieving competitive performance with closed-source LLMs across multiple reasoning trace settings.</p></details> |  |

We propose a robust SASV framework in which a spoofing detector and a speaker verification (SV) network operate in tandem. The spoofing detector employs a self-supervised speech embedding extractor as the frontend, combined with a state-of-the-art graph neural network backend. In addition, a top-3 layer based mixture-of-experts (MoE) is used to fuse high-level and low-level features for effective spoofed utterance detection. For speaker verification, we adapt a low-complexity convolutional neural network that fuses 2D and 1D features at multiple scales, trained with the SphereFace loss. Additionally, contrastive circle loss is applied to adaptively weight positive and negative pairs within each training batch, enabling the network to better distinguish between hard and easy sample pairs. Finally, fixed imposter cohort based AS Norm score normalization and model ensembling are used to further enhance the discriminative capability of the speaker verification system.</p></details> |  |

We propose \textbf{PIMPC-GNN}, a physics-informed multi-phase consensus framework for imbalanced node classification. Our method integrates three complementary dynamics: (i) thermodynamic diffusion, which spreads minority labels to capture long-range dependencies, (ii) Kuramoto synchronisation, which aligns minority nodes through oscillatory consensus, and (iii) spectral embedding, which separates classes via structural regularisation. These perspectives are combined through class-adaptive ensemble weighting and trained with an imbalance-aware loss that couples balanced cross-entropy with physics-based constraints. Across five benchmark datasets and imbalance ratios from 5-100, PIMPC-GNN outperforms 16 state-of-the-art baselines, achieving notable gains in minority-class recall (up to +12.7\%) and balanced accuracy (up to +8.3\%). Beyond empirical improvements, the framework also provides interpretable insights into consensus dynamics in graph learning. The code is available at \texttt{https://github.com/afofanah/PIMPC-GNN}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grappa: Gradient-Only Communication for Scalable Graph Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01872v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-partition edges dominate the cost of distributed GNN training: fetching remote features and activations per iteration overwhelms the network as graphs deepen and partition counts grow. Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We prove the corrected estimator is asymptotically unbiased under standard support and boundedness assumptions, and we derive a batch-level variant for compatibility with common deep-learning packages that minimizes mean-squared deviation from the ideal node-level correction. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4 times faster on average (up to 13 times) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preservation Theorems for Unravelling-Invariant Classes: A Uniform Approach for Modal Logics and Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01856v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study preservation theorems for modal logics over finite structures with respect to three fundamental semantic relations: embeddings, injective homomorphisms, and homomorphisms. We focus on classes of pointed Kripke models that are invariant under bounded unravellings, a natural locality condition satisfied by modal logics and by graph neural networks (GNNs). We show that preservation under embeddings coincides with definability in existential graded modal logic; preservation under injective homomorphisms with definability in existential positive graded modal logic; and preservation under homomorphisms with definability in existential positive modal logic. A key technical contribution is a structural well-quasi-ordering result. We prove that the embedding relation on classes of tree-shaped models of uniformly bounded height forms a well-quasi-order, and that the bounded-height assumption is essential. This well-quasi-ordering yields a finite minimal-tree argument leading to explicit syntactic characterisations via finite disjunctions of (graded) modal formulae. As an application, we derive consequences for the expressive power of GNNs. Using our preservation theorem for injective homomorphisms, we obtain a new logical characterisation of monotonic GNNs, showing that they capture exactly existential-positive graded modal logic, while monotonic GNNs with MAX aggregation correspond precisely to existential-positive modal logic.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks Under the Microscope: The Role of Geometry-Task Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01828v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many complex networks exhibit hyperbolic structural properties, making hyperbolic space a natural candidate for representing hierarchical and tree-like graphs with low distortion. Based on this observation, Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted as a principled choice for representation learning on tree-like graphs. In this work, we question this paradigm by proposing an additional condition of geometry-task alignment, i.e., whether the metric structure of the target follows that of the input graph. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the capability of HGNNs to recover low-distortion representations on two synthetic regression problems, and show that their geometric inductive bias becomes helpful when the problem requires preserving metric structure. Additionally, we evaluate HGNNs on the tasks of link prediction and node classification by jointly analyzing predictive performance and embedding distortion, revealing that only link prediction is geometry-aligned. Overall, our findings shift the focus from only asking "Is the graph hyperbolic?" to also questioning "Is the task aligned with hyperbolic geometry?", showing that HGNNs consistently outperform Euclidean models under such alignment, while their advantage vanishes otherwise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object-Centric Representation Learning for Enhanced 3D Scene Graph Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04714v3)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Semantic Scene Graph Prediction aims to detect objects and their semantic relationships in 3D scenes, and has emerged as a crucial technology for robotics and AR/VR applications. While previous research has addressed dataset limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings, they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction. Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction. Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Previous graph neural network (GNN) models leverage molecular structures and interaction networks but mostly rely on linear aggregation and symmetric assumptions, limiting their ability to capture nonlinear and heterogeneous patterns. We propose MGKAN, a Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network that introduces learnable basis functions into asymmetric DDI prediction. MGKAN replaces conventional MLP transformations with KAN-driven basis functions, enabling more expressive and nonlinear modeling of drug relationships. To capture pharmacological dependencies, MGKAN integrates three network views-an asymmetric DDI network, a co-interaction network, and a biochemical similarity network-with role-specific embeddings to preserve directional semantics. A fusion module combines linear attention and nonlinear transformation to enhance representational capacity. On two benchmark datasets, MGKAN outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies and case studies confirm its predictive accuracy and effectiveness in modeling directional drug effects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

We present a systematic approach for constructing continuous rotationally invariant and equivariant functions using symmetric tensor networks. The proposed framework supports inputs and outputs given as a tuple of Cartesian tensors of different rank as well as spherical tensors of different type. We introduce tensor network generators for invariant maps and obtain equivariant maps via differentiation. Specifically, we derive general continuous equivariant maps from vector inputs to Cartesian or spherical tensor output. Finally, we clarify how common equivariant primitives in geometric graph neural networks arise within our construction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plain Transformers are Surprisingly Powerful Link Predictors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01553v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link prediction is a core challenge in graph machine learning, demanding models that capture rich and complex topological dependencies. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the standard solution, state-of-the-art pipelines often rely on explicit structural heuristics or memory-intensive node embeddings -- approaches that struggle to generalize or scale to massive graphs. Emerging Graph Transformers (GTs) offer a potential alternative but often incur significant overhead due to complex structural encodings, hindering their applications to large-scale link prediction. We challenge these sophisticated paradigms with PENCIL, an encoder-only plain Transformer that replaces hand-crafted priors with attention over sampled local subgraphs, retaining the scalability and hardware efficiency of standard Transformers. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, we show that PENCIL extracts richer structural signals than GNNs, implicitly generalizing a broad class of heuristics and subgraph-based expressivity. Empirically, PENCIL outperforms heuristic-informed GNNs and is far more parameter-efficient than ID-embedding--based alternatives, while remaining competitive across diverse benchmarks -- even without node features. Our results challenge the prevailing reliance on complex engineering techniques, demonstrating that simple design choices are potentially sufficient to achieve the same capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Qrita: High-performance Top-k and Top-p Algorithm for GPUs using Pivot-based Truncation and Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01518v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Top-k and Top-p are the dominant truncation operators in the sampling of large language models. Despite their widespread use, implementing them efficiently over large vocabularies remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on sorting, which incur significant computation and memory overhead on GPUs, or stochastic approaches, which alter the algorithm output. In this work, we propose Qrita, an efficient Top-k and Top-p algorithm based on a pivot-based selection strategy. Based on RTop-k, which uses a pivot-based search for node selection in graph neural networks, Qrita extends the concept of pivot-based search to both Top-k and Top-p with two key techniques: 1. Gaussian-based sigma-truncation, which greatly reduces the search space of the target elements, and 2. Quaternary pivot search with duplication handling, which halves the pivot search iteration and guarantees deterministic output. We provide the full implementation of Qrita using Triton, a popular GPU programming language. Our evaluation of Qrita against the Top-k and Top-p kernels of high performance LLM execution engines such as vLLM, SGLang, and Flashinfer show that Qrita achieves up to 2 times throughput and half memory use while providing the same output to the the sorting-based algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Large Language Models Do Not Work: Online Incivility Prediction through Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07684v2)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online incivility has emerged as a widespread and persistent problem in digital communities, imposing substantial social and psychological burdens on users. Although many platforms attempt to curb incivility through moderation and automated detection, the performance of existing approaches often remains limited in both accuracy and efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for detecting three types of uncivil behavior (i.e., toxicity, aggression, and personal attacks) within the English Wikipedia community. Our model represents each user comment as a node, with textual similarity between comments defining the edges, allowing the network to jointly learn from both linguistic content and relational structures among comments. We also introduce a dynamically adjusted attention mechanism that adaptively balances nodal and topological features during information aggregation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms 12 state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple metrics while requiring significantly lower inference cost. These findings highlight the crucial role of structural context in detecting online incivility and address the limitations of text-only LLM paradigms in behavioral prediction. All datasets and comparative outputs will be publicly available in our repository to support further research and reproducibility.</p></details> | 10 pages |

This enables a single model to flexibly adapt to arbitrary trade-offs at run-time by producing a policy on or near the Pareto front. However, existing benchmarks for PCPL are largely restricted to toy tasks and fixed environments, limiting their realism and scalability. To address this gap, we introduce GraphAllocBench, a flexible benchmark built on a novel graph-based resource allocation sandbox environment inspired by city management, which we call CityPlannerEnv. GraphAllocBench provides a rich suite of problems with diverse objective functions, varying preference conditions, and high-dimensional scalability. We also propose two new evaluation metrics -- Proportion of Non-Dominated Solutions (PNDS) and Ordering Score (OS) -- that directly capture preference consistency while complementing the widely used hypervolume metric. Through experiments with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and graph-aware models, we show that GraphAllocBench exposes the limitations of existing MORL approaches and paves the way for using graph-based methods such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in complex, high-dimensional combinatorial allocation tasks. Beyond its predefined problem set, GraphAllocBench enables users to flexibly vary objectives, preferences, and allocation rules, establishing it as a versatile and extensible benchmark for advancing PCPL.

Despite their growing popularity and success across various applications, GNNs encounter several challenges that limit their performance. in their generalization, robustness to adversarial perturbations, and the effectiveness of their representation learning capabilities. In this dissertation, I investigate these core aspects through three main contributions: (1) developing new representation learning techniques based on Graph Shift Operators (GSOs, aiming for enhanced performance across various contexts and applications, (2) introducing generalization-enhancing methods through graph data augmentation, and (3) developing more robust GNNs by leveraging orthonormalization techniques and noise-based defenses against adversarial attacks.

Spiking neural networks offer event-driven efficiency but remain limited by sequential propagation, binary information loss, and local aggregation that misses global context. We propose ChronoSpike, an adaptive spiking graph neural network that integrates learnable LIF neurons with per-channel membrane dynamics, multi-head attentive spatial aggregation on continuous features, and a lightweight Transformer temporal encoder, enabling both fine-grained local modeling and long-range dependency capture with linear memory complexity $O(T \cdot d)$. On three large-scale benchmarks, ChronoSpike outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baselines by $2.0\%$ Macro-F1 and $2.4\%$ Micro-F1 while achieving $3-10\times$ faster training than recurrent methods with a constant 105K-parameter budget independent of graph size. We provide theoretical guarantees for membrane potential boundedness, gradient flow stability under contraction factor $ρ< 1$, and BIBO stability; interpretability analyses reveal heterogeneous temporal receptive fields and a learned primacy effect with $83-88\%$ sparsity.</p></details> |  |

In such settings, an adversary that compromises a small number of edge devices may inject counterfeit nodes (e.g., rogue sensors, virtualized endpoints, or spoofed substations) to bias downstream decisions while evading topology- and homophily-based sanitization. This paper formulates deployment-oriented node-injection attacks under constrained resources and proposes the \emph{Single-Edge Graph Injection Attack} (SEGIA), in which each injected node attaches to the operational graph through a single edge. SEGIA integrates a pruned SGC surrogate, multi-hop neighborhood sampling, and reverse graph convolution-based feature synthesis with a similarity-regularized objective to preserve local homophily and survive edge pruning. Theoretical analysis and extensive evaluations across datasets and defenses show at least $25\%$ higher attack success than representative baselines under substantially smaller edge budgets. These results indicate a system-level risk in industrial GNN deployments and motivate lightweight admission validation and neighborhood-consistency monitoring.</p></details> |  |

Yet discovering GPCR modulators remains challenging because receptor activation often arises from complex allosteric effects rather than direct binding affinity, and conventional assays are slow, costly, and not optimized for capturing these dynamics. Here we present GPCR-Filter, a deep learning framework specifically developed for GPCR modulator discovery. We assembled a high-quality dataset of over 90,000 experimentally validated GPCR-ligand pairs, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluation. GPCR-Filter integrates the ESM-3 protein language model for high-fidelity GPCR sequence representations with graph neural networks that encode ligand structures, coupled through an attention-based fusion mechanism that learns receptor-ligand functional relationships. Across multiple evaluation settings, GPCR-Filter consistently outperforms state-of-the-art compound-protein interaction models and exhibits strong generalization to unseen receptors and ligands. Notably, the model successfully identified micromolar-level agonists of the 5-HT\textsubscript{1A} receptor with distinct chemical frameworks. These results establish GPCR-Filter as a scalable and effective computational approach for GPCR modulator discovery, advancing AI-assisted drug development for complex signaling systems.</p></details> |  |

In the past few years, rapid developments of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have offered a solution to scale up quantum mechanical calculations. Parallelizing these interatomic potentials across multiple devices poses a challenging, but promising approach to further extending simulation scales to real-world applications. In this work, we present DistMLIP, an efficient distributed inference platform for MLIPs based on zero-redundancy, graph-level parallelization. In contrast to conventional spatial partitioning parallelization, DistMLIP enables efficient MLIP parallelization through graph partitioning, allowing multi-device inference on flexible MLIP model architectures like multi-layer graph neural networks. DistMLIP presents an easy-to-use, flexible, plug-in interface that enables distributed inference of pre-existing MLIPs. We demonstrate DistMLIP on four widely used and state-of-the-art MLIPs: CHGNet, MACE, TensorNet, and eSEN. We show that DistMLIP can simulate atomic systems 3.4x larger and up to 8x faster compared to previous multi-GPU methods. We show that existing foundation potentials can perform near-million-atom calculations at the scale of a few seconds on 8 GPUs with DistMLIP.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

Focusing on the Travelling Salesman Problem, we show that encoding global structural constraints as an inductive bias enables a non-autoregressive model to generate solutions via direct forward passes, without search, supervision, or sequential decision-making. At inference time, dropout and snapshot ensembling allow a single model to act as an implicit ensemble, reducing optimality gaps through increased solution diversity. Our results establish that graph neural networks do not require supervised training nor explicit search to be effective. Instead, they can internalize global combinatorial structure and function as strong, learned heuristics. This reframes the role of learning in combinatorial optimization: from augmenting classical algorithms to directly instantiating new heuristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 tables with 2 figures, code repo included in the manuscript</p></details> |

However, existing GNN-based methods often face challenges in learning multiscale representations and modeling long-range dependencies efficiently. In this work, we propose an efficient multiscale graph-based learning framework tailored to proteins. Our proposed framework contains two crucial components: (1) It constructs a hierarchical graph representation comprising a collection of fine-grained subgraphs, each corresponding to a secondary structure motif (e.g., $α$-helices, $β$-strands, loops), and a single coarse-grained graph that connects these motifs based on their spatial arrangement and relative orientation. (2) It employs two GNNs for feature learning: the first operates within individual secondary motifs to capture local interactions, and the second models higher-level structural relationships across motifs. Our modular framework allows a flexible choice of GNN in each stage. Theoretically, we show that our hierarchical framework preserves the desired maximal expressiveness, ensuring no loss of critical structural information. Empirically, we demonstrate that integrating baseline GNNs into our multiscale framework remarkably improves prediction accuracy and reduces computational cost across various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We introduce AutoGNN, an FPGA-based accelerator designed to address these challenges by leveraging FPGA's reconfigurability and specialized components. AutoGNN adapts to diverse graph inputs, efficiently performing computationally intensive tasks such as graph conversion and sampling. By utilizing components like adder trees, AutoGNN executes reduction operations in constant time, overcoming the limitations of serialization and synchronization on GPUs. AutoGNN integrates unified processing elements (UPEs) and single-cycle reducers (SCRs) to streamline GNN preprocessing. UPEs enable scalable parallel processing for edge sorting and unique vertex selection, while SCRs efficiently handle sequential tasks such as pointer array construction and subgraph reindexing. A user-level software framework dynamically profiles graph inputs, determines optimal configurations, and reprograms AutoGNN to handle varying workloads. Implemented on a 7$n$m enterprise FPGA, AutoGNN achieves up to 9.0$\times$ and 2.1$\times$ speedup compared to conventional and GPU-accelerated preprocessing systems, respectively, enabling high-performance GNN preprocessing across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[When LLM Agents Meet Graph Optimization: An Automated Data Quality Improvement Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08952v3)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have become a key form of graph-structured data in modern data management and analytics, combining structural relationships with rich textual semantics for diverse applications. However, the effectiveness of analytical models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), is highly sensitive to data quality. Our empirical analysis shows that both conventional and LLM-enhanced GNNs degrade notably under textual, structural, and label imperfections, underscoring TAG quality as a key bottleneck for reliable analytics. Existing studies have explored data-level optimization for TAGs, but most focus on specific degradation types and target a single aspect like structure or label, lacking a systematic and comprehensive perspective on data quality improvement. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework for comprehensive TAG quality optimization. LAGA formulates graph quality control as a data-centric process, integrating detection, planning, action, and evaluation agents into an automated loop. It holistically enhances textual, structural, and label aspects through coordinated multi-modal optimization. Extensive experiments on 5 datasets and 16 baselines across 9 scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and scalability of LAGA, confirming the importance of data-centric quality optimization for reliable TAG analytics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10figures |

A key challenge is the severe lack of training data, as many properties are too complicated to calculate with high-throughput first principles techniques. To address this, recent research has created experimental databases from information extracted from scientific literature. However, most existing experimental databases do not provide full atomic coordinate information, which prevents them from supporting advanced ML architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this work, we propose to bridge this gap through an alignment process between experimental databases and Crystallographic Information Files (CIF) from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Our approach enables the creation of a database that can fully leverage state-of-the-art model architectures for material property prediction. It also opens the door to utilizing transfer learning to improve prediction accuracy. To validate our approach, we align NEMAD with the ICSD and compare models trained on the resulting database to those trained on NEMAD originally. We demonstrate significant improvements in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Correct Classification Rate (CCR) in predicting the ordering temperatures and magnetic ground states of magnetic materials, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, submitted to Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials</p></details> |

| **[Kernelized Edge Attention: Addressing Semantic Attention Blurring in Temporal Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00596v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) aim to capture the evolving structure and timing of interactions in dynamic graphs. Although many models incorporate time through encodings or architectural design, they often compute attention over entangled node and edge representations, failing to reflect their distinct temporal behaviors. Node embeddings evolve slowly as they aggregate long-term structural context, while edge features reflect transient, timestamped interactions (e.g. messages, trades, or transactions). This mismatch results in semantic attention blurring, where attention weights cannot distinguish between slowly drifting node states and rapidly changing, information-rich edge interactions. As a result, models struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and provide limited transparency into how temporal relevance is computed. This paper introduces KEAT (Kernelized Edge Attention for Temporal Graphs), a novel attention formulation that modulates edge features using a family of continuous-time kernels, including Laplacian, RBF, and learnable MLP variant. KEAT preserves the distinct roles of nodes and edges, and integrates seamlessly with both Transformer-style (e.g., DyGFormer) and message-passing (e.g., TGN) architectures. It achieves up to 18% MRR improvement over the recent DyGFormer and 7% over TGN on link prediction tasks, enabling more accurate, interpretable and temporally aware message passing in TGNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) embedding framework that integrates graph neural network representations with dynamically retrieved literature-derived knowledge through contrastive learning. Benchmarking against ten embedding methods reveals task-specific complementarity: topology-focused methods achieve near-perfect link prediction (GCN: 0.983 AUROC), while RAG-GNN is the only method achieving positive silhouette scores for functional clustering (0.001 vs. negative scores for all baselines). Information-theoretic decomposition shows network topology contributes 77.3% of predictive information, while retrieved documents provide 8.6% unique information. Applied to cancer signaling networks (379 proteins, 3,498 interactions), the framework identifies DDR1 as a therapeutic target based on retrieved evidence of synthetic lethality with KRAS mutations. These results establish that topology-only and retrieval-augmented approaches serve complementary purposes: structural prediction tasks are solved by network topology alone, while functional interpretation uniquely benefits from retrieved knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[FloydNet: A Learning Paradigm for Global Relational Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19094v2)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing models capable of complex, multi-step reasoning is a central goal in artificial intelligence. While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark. Our results establish this learned, DP-style refinement as a powerful and practical alternative to message passing for high-level graph reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 9 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |

Although post-training model editing offers a pathway for dynamic updates, existing methods frequently suffer from overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry and graph neural networks for precise and stable model edits. We introduce HYPE (HYperbolic Parameter Editing), which comprises three key components: (i) Hyperbolic Graph Construction, which uses Poincaré embeddings to represent knowledge triples in hyperbolic space, preserving hierarchical relationships and preventing unintended side effects by ensuring that edits to parent concepts do not inadvertently affect child concepts; (ii) Möbius-Transformed Updates, which apply hyperbolic addition to propagate edits while maintaining structural consistency within the hyperbolic manifold, unlike conventional Euclidean updates that distort relational distances; and (iii) Dual Stabilization, which combines gradient masking and periodic GNN parameter resetting to prevent catastrophic forgetting by focusing updates on critical parameters and preserving long-term knowledge. Experiments on CounterFact, CounterFact+, and MQuAKE with GPT-J and GPT2-XL demonstrate that HYPE significantly enhances edit stability, factual accuracy, and multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fed-Listing: Federated Label Distribution Inference in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00407v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been intensively studied for their expressive representation and learning performance on graph-structured data, enabling effective modeling of complex relational dependencies among nodes and edges in various domains. However, the standalone GNNs can unleash threat surfaces and privacy implications, as some sensitive graph-structured data is collected and processed in a centralized setting. To solve this issue, Federated Graph Neural Networks (FedGNNs) are proposed to facilitate collaborative learning over decentralized local graph data, aiming to preserve user privacy. Yet, emerging research indicates that even in these settings, shared model updates, particularly gradients, can unintentionally leak sensitive information of local users. Numerous privacy inference attacks have been explored in traditional federated learning and extended to graph settings, but the problem of label distribution inference in FedGNNs remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fed-Listing (Federated Label Distribution Inference in GNNs), a novel gradient-based attack designed to infer the private label statistics of target clients in FedGNNs without access to raw data or node features. Fed-Listing only leverages the final-layer gradients exchanged during training to uncover statistical patterns that reveal class proportions in a stealthy manner. An auxiliary shadow dataset is used to generate diverse label partitioning strategies, simulating various client distributions, on which the attack model is obtained. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and three GNN architectures show that Fed-Listing significantly outperforms existing baselines, including random guessing and Decaf, even under challenging non-i.i.d. scenarios. Moreover, applying defense mechanisms can barely reduce our attack performance, unless the model's utility is severely degraded.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, and 5 tables</p></details> |

The two networks interact with each other at the layer level to find a saddle point of the Lagrangian. The primal GNN finds a stationary point for a given dual multiplier, while the dual network iteratively refines its estimates to reach an optimal solution. We force the primal and dual networks to mirror the dynamics of the DA algorithm by imposing descent and ascent constraints. We propose a joint training scheme that alternates between updating the primal and dual networks. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach yields near-optimal near-feasible solutions and generalizes well to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Transport-Guided Adversarial Attacks on Graph Neural Network-Based Bot Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00318v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of bot accounts on social media poses significant risks to public discourse. To address this threat, modern bot detectors increasingly rely on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the effectiveness of these GNN-based detectors in real-world settings remains poorly understood. In practice, attackers continuously adapt their strategies as well as must operate under domain-specific and temporal constraints, which can fundamentally limit the applicability of existing attack methods. As a result, there is a critical need for robust GNN-based bot detection methods under realistic, constraint-aware attack scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce BOCLOAK to systematically evaluate the robustness of GNN-based social bot detection via both edge editing and node injection adversarial attacks under realistic constraints. BOCLOAK constructs a probability measure over spatio-temporal neighbor features and learns an optimal transport geometry that separates human and bot behaviors. It then decodes transport plans into sparse, plausible edge edits that evade detection while obeying real-world constraints. We evaluate BOCLOAK across three social bot datasets, five state-of-the-art bot detectors, three adversarial defenses, and compare it against four leading graph adversarial attack baselines. BOCLOAK achieves up to 80.13% higher attack success rates while using 99.80% less GPU memory under realistic real-world constraints. Most importantly, BOCLOAK shows that optimal transport provides a lightweight, principled framework for bridging the gap between adversarial attacks and real-world bot detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00647v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sheaf diffusion has recently emerged as a promising design pattern for graph representation learning due to its inherent ability to handle heterophilic data and avoid oversmoothing. Meanwhile, cooperative message passing has also been proposed as a way to enhance the flexibility of information diffusion by allowing nodes to independently choose whether to propagate/gather information from/to neighbors. A natural question ensues: is sheaf diffusion capable of exhibiting this cooperative behavior? Here, we provide a negative answer to this question. In particular, we show that existing sheaf diffusion methods fail to achieve cooperative behavior due to the lack of message directionality. To circumvent this limitation, we introduce the notion of cellular sheaves over directed graphs and characterize their in- and out-degree Laplacians. We leverage our construction to propose Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks (CSNNs). Theoretically, we characterize the receptive field of CSNN and show it allows nodes to selectively attend (listen) to arbitrarily far nodes while ignoring all others in their path, potentially mitigating oversquashing. Our experiments show that CSNN presents overall better performance compared to prior art on sheaf diffusion as well as cooperative graph neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

In this work, we shift our attention to GNNs that perform message passing on edges and introduce EB-1WL, an edge-based color-refinement test, and a corresponding architecture, EB-GNN. Our EB-GNN architecture is inspired by the classic triangle-counting algorithm of Chiba and Nishizeki and passes messages along edges and triangles. Our contributions are as follows: (1) Theoretically, we show that EB-1WL is significantly more expressive than 1WL. We provide a complete logical characterization of EB-1WL in first-order logic, along with distinguishability results via homomorphism counting. To the best of our knowledge, EB-GNN has the strongest theoretical expressivity guarantees among edge-based message-passing GNNs in the literature. (2) Unlike many GNN architectures that are more expressive than 1WL, we prove that EB-1WL and EB-GNN admit near-linear time and memory usage on practical graph learning workloads. (3) We show in experiments that EB-GNN is a highly efficient general-purpose architecture: it substantially outperforms simple MPNNs and remains competitive with task-specialized state-of-the-art GNNs at substantially lower computational cost.</p></details> |  |

We partially address this gap for node regression with graph-based errors-in-variables models under simultaneous covariate and edge corruption: responses are generated from latent node-level covariates, but only noise-perturbed versions of the latent covariates are observed; and the sample graph is a random geometric graph created from the node covariates but contaminated by independent Erdős--Rényi edges. We propose and analyze a carefully designed, task-specific GAT that constructs denoised proxy features for regression. We prove that regressing the response variables on the proxies achieves lower error asymptotically in (a) estimating the regression coefficient compared to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator on the noisy node covariates, and (b) predicting the response for an unlabelled node compared to a vanilla graph convolutional network~(GCN) -- under mild growth conditions. Our analysis leverages high-dimensional geometric tail bounds and concentration for neighbourhood counts and sample covariances. We verify our theoretical findings through experiments on synthetically generated data. We also perform experiments on real-world graphs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in several node regression tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Sequence Diffusion Model for Temporal Link Prediction in Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23233v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a fundamental problem in many real-world systems. Existing temporal graph neural networks mainly focus on learning representations of historical interactions. Despite their strong performance, these models are still purely discriminative, producing point estimates for future links and lacking an explicit mechanism to capture the uncertainty and sequential structure of future temporal interactions. In this paper, we propose SDG, a novel sequence-level diffusion framework that unifies dynamic graph learning with generative denoising. Specifically, SDG injects noise into the entire historical interaction sequence and jointly reconstructs all interaction embeddings through a conditional denoising process, thereby enabling the model to capture more comprehensive interaction distributions. To align the generative process with temporal link prediction, we employ a cross-attention denoising decoder to guide the reconstruction of the destination sequence and optimize the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on various temporal graph benchmarks show that SDG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the temporal link prediction task.</p></details> |  |

Rational design is often bottlenecked by the inability to predict how subtle changes in domain topology influence functional outcomes, a challenge exacerbated by the scarcity of comprehensive experimental data. Here, we introduce a computational framework to address part of this gap. First, we present a generative method for creating large-scale, realistic synthetic functional landscapes that capture non-linear interactions where biological activity depends on domain connectivity. Second, we propose a graph neural network architecture that explicitly encodes these topological constraints, distinguishing between format configurations that appear identical to sequence-only models. We demonstrate that this model, trained on synthetic landscapes, recapitulates complex functional properties and, via transfer learning, has the potential to achieve high predictive accuracy on limited biological datasets. We showcase the model's utility by optimizing trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity in trispecific T-cell engagers and retrieving optimal common light chains. This work provides a robust benchmarking environment for disentangling the combinatorial complexity of multispecifics, accelerating the design of next-generation therapeutics.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, code available at https://github.com/prescient-design/synapse</p></details> |

In this work, we prove exact learnability results for graph algorithms under bounded-degree and finite-precision constraints. Our approach follows a two-step process. First, we train an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to execute the local instructions of a single node. Second, during inference, we use the trained MLP ensemble as the update function within a graph neural network (GNN). Leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, we show that local instructions can be learned from a small training set, enabling the complete graph algorithm to be executed during inference without error and with high probability. To illustrate the learning power of our setting, we establish a rigorous learnability result for the LOCAL model of distributed computation. We further demonstrate positive learnability results for widely studied algorithms such as message flooding, breadth-first and depth-first search, and Bellman-Ford.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning and extrapolating scale-invariant processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14810v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning (ML) has deeply changed some fields recently, like Language and Vision and we may expect it to be relevant also to the analysis of of complex systems. Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator. Based on these experiments and a complete characterization of the linear case, we identify the main issues relative to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and discuss how to alleviate them with the relevant inductive biases.</p></details> | 29p, 22 figures |

Most existing methods preserve either spectral or spatial characteristics. Recent research has shown that preserving topological features helps maintain the predictive performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on the coarsened graph but suffers from exponential time complexity. To address these problems, we propose Scalable Topology-Preserving Graph Coarsening (STPGC) by introducing the concepts of graph strong collapse and graph edge collapse extended from algebraic topology. STPGC comprises three new algorithms, GStrongCollapse, GEdgeCollapse, and NeighborhoodConing based on these two concepts, which eliminate dominated nodes and edges while rigorously preserving topological features. We further prove that STPGC preserves the GNN receptive field and develop approximate algorithms to accelerate GNN training. Experiments on node classification with GNNs demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of STPGC.</p></details> |  |

Although recent works have highlighted that these explanations can be suboptimal and potentially misleading, a characterization of their failure cases is unavailable. In this work, we identify a critical failure of SE-GNN explanations: explanations can be unambiguously unrelated to how the SE-GNNs infer labels. We show that, on the one hand, many SE-GNNs can achieve optimal true risk while producing these degenerate explanations, and on the other, most faithfulness metrics can fail to identify these failure modes. Our empirical analysis reveals that degenerate explanations can be maliciously planted (allowing an attacker to hide the use of sensitive attributes) and can also emerge naturally, highlighting the need for reliable auditing. To address this, we introduce a novel faithfulness metric that reliably marks degenerate explanations as unfaithful, in both malicious and natural settings. Our code is available in the supplemental.</p></details> | Accepted at ICLR26 |

However, due to differences in training protocols, forecast horizons, and data choices, it remains unclear which (if any) of these methods and architectures are most suitable for weather forecasting and for future model development. Here, we step back and provide a detailed empirical analysis, under controlled conditions, comparing and contrasting the most prominent DLWP models, along with their backbones. We accomplish this by predicting synthetic two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes and real-world global weather dynamics. On synthetic data, we observe favorable performance of FNO, while on the real-world WeatherBench dataset, our results demonstrate the suitability of ConvLSTM and SwinTransformer for short-to-mid-ranged forecasts. For long-ranged weather rollouts of up to 50 years, we observe superior stability and physical soundness in architectures that formulate a spherical data representation, i.e., GraphCast and Spherical FNO.

While CP algorithms have evolved beyond traditional classifiers and regressors to sophisticated deep learning models like deep neural networks (DNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and large language models (LLMs), existing CP libraries often lack the model support and scalability for large-scale deep learning (DL) scenarios. This paper introduces TorchCP, a PyTorch-native library designed to integrate state-of-the-art CP algorithms into DL techniques, including DNN-based classifiers/regressors, GNNs, and LLMs. Released under the LGPL-3.0 license, TorchCP comprises about 16k lines of code, validated with 100\% unit test coverage and detailed documentation. Notably, TorchCP enables CP-specific training algorithms, online prediction, and GPU-accelerated batch processing, achieving up to 90\% reduction in inference time on large datasets. With its low-coupling design, comprehensive suite of advanced methods, and full GPU scalability, TorchCP empowers researchers and practitioners to enhance uncertainty quantification across cutting-edge applications.</p></details> |  |

A core challenge in comparing these two GNN training approaches lies in characterizing their model performance (i.e., convergence and generalization) and computational efficiency. While a batch size has been an effective lens in analyzing such behaviors in deep neural networks (DNNs), GNNs extend this lens by introducing a fan-out size, as full-graph training can be viewed as mini-batch training with the largest possible batch size and fan-out size. However, the impact of the batch and fan-out size for GNNs remains insufficiently explored. To this end, this paper systematically compares full-graph vs. mini-batch training of GNNs through empirical and theoretical analyses from the view points of the batch size and fan-out size. Our key contributions include: 1) We provide a novel generalization analysis using the Wasserstein distance to study the impact of the graph structure, especially the fan-out size. 2) We uncover the non-isotropic effects of the batch size and the fan-out size in GNN convergence and generalization, providing practical guidance for tuning these hyperparameters under resource constraints. Finally, full-graph training does not always yield better model performance or computational efficiency than well-tuned smaller mini-batch settings. The implementation can be found in the github link: https://github.com/LIUMENGFAN-gif/GNN_fullgraph_minibatch_training.</p></details> |  |

We argue this approach is suboptimal for text-graphs: it creates a conceptually disjointed interaction paradigm. By segregating structural encoding from semantic processing, these systems must perform a complex implicit alignment between abstract graph tokens and concrete textual elements. Challenging the necessity of external encoders, we propose NAG (Native Architecture for Graphs), a unified framework that internalizes graph processing within the LM's native manifold. Instead of bridging disparate embedding spaces, NAG repurposes the self-attention mechanism to enforce topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs to ensure structural equivalence. This allows the model to harness its intrinsic linguistic capability to simultaneously comprehend node and edge content alongside structural topology. We introduce two efficient implementations: NAG-Zero for absolute preservation of the base model's linguistic capabilities, and NAG-LoRA for enhanced structural adaptation. Experiments across diverse graph tasks validate that NAG achieves robust graph comprehension without the overhead of external encoders, offering a simpler, more coherent paradigm for text-graph modeling.</p></details> |  |

Traditional bot mitigation techniques, including IP blacklists and CAPTCHA-based challenges, are increasingly ineffective or intrusive, as modern bots leverage proxies, botnets, and AI-assisted evasion strategies. This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs. The proposed framework is deployment-friendly, integrates with existing systems without client-side instrumentation, and supports real-time inference and incremental updates, making it suitable for practical e-commerce security deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Logical Expressiveness in Graph Neural Networks via Path-Neighbor Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07994v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively model structural information of graphs, making them widely used in knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However, existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions, exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures. Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose Assembly Flow Graph (AFG) to comprehensively represent the assembly flow of a binary executable as graph data. Importantly, AFG can be used to extract granular explanations needed to increase transparency for malware detection using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, since AFGs may be large in practice, we also propose a Meta-Coarsening approach to improve computational tractability via graph reduction. To evaluate our proposed approach we consider several novel and existing metrics to quantify the granularity and quality of explanations. Lastly, we also consider several hyperparameters in our proposed Meta-Coarsening approach that can be used to control the final explanation size. We evaluate our proposed approach using the CIC-DGG-2025 dataset. Our results indicate that our proposed AFG and Meta-Coarsening approach can provide both increased explainability and inference performance at certain coarsening levels. However, most importantly, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider granular explainability in malware detection using GNNs.</p></details> |  |

Explainability techniques (XAI) have made remarkable progress in the interpretability of ML models. However, the non-euclidean nature of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) makes it difficult to reuse already existing XAI methods. While other works have focused on instance-based explanation methods for GNNs, very few have investigated model-based methods and, to our knowledge, none have tried to probe the embedding of the GNNs for structural graph properties. In this paper we present a model agnostic explainability pipeline for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) employing diagnostic classifiers. We propose to consider graph-theoretic properties as the features of choice for studying the emergence of representations in GNNs. This pipeline aims to probe and interpret the learned representations in GNNs across various architectures and datasets, refining our understanding and trust in these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 22 figures, conference</p></details> |

By combining generative inverse design with multimodal learning, our approach accelerates the exploration of chemical-structural space and facilitates the discovery of materials that satisfy predefined property targets. MEIDNet exhibits strong latent-space alignment with cosine similarity 0.96 by fusion of three modalities through cross-modal learning. Through implementation of curriculum learning strategies, MEIDNet achieves ~60 times higher learning efficiency than conventional training techniques. The potential of our multimodal approach is demonstrated by generating low-bandgap perovskite structures at a stable, unique, and novel (SUN) rate of 13.6 %, which are further validated by ab initio methods. Our inverse design framework demonstrates both scalability and adaptability, paving the way for the universal learning of chemical space across diverse modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Graph Structure and Knowledge-Guided Editing for Interpretable Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21978v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) aims to predict future events by inferring missing entities with dynamic knowledge structures. Existing LLM-based reasoning methods prioritize contextual over structural relations, struggling to extract relevant subgraphs from dynamic graphs. This limits structural information understanding, leading to unstructured, hallucination-prone inferences especially with temporal inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose IGETR (Integration of Graph and Editing-enhanced Temporal Reasoning), a hybrid reasoning framework that combines the structured temporal modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the contextual understanding of LLMs. IGETR operates through a three-stage pipeline. The first stage aims to ground the reasoning process in the actual data by identifying structurally and temporally coherent candidate paths through a temporal GNN, ensuring that inference starts from reliable graph-based evidence. The second stage introduces LLM-guided path editing to address logical and semantic inconsistencies, leveraging external knowledge to refine and enhance the initial paths. The final stage focuses on integrating the refined reasoning paths to produce predictions that are both accurate and interpretable. Experiments on standard TKG benchmarks show that IGETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines with relative improvements of up to 5.6% on Hits@1 and 8.1% on Hits@3 on the challenging ICEWS datasets. Additionally, we execute ablation studies and additional analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we formally introduce and study two query answering problems, namely, query answer classification and query answer retrieval. To solve these problems, we propose AnyCQ, a model that can classify answers to any conjunctive query on any knowledge graph. At the core of our framework lies a graph neural network trained using a reinforcement learning objective to answer Boolean queries. Trained only on simple, small instances, AnyCQ generalizes to large queries of arbitrary structure, reliably classifying and retrieving answers to queries that existing approaches fail to handle. This is empirically validated through our newly proposed, challenging benchmarks. Finally, we empirically show that AnyCQ can effectively transfer to completely novel knowledge graphs when equipped with an appropriate link prediction model, highlighting its potential for querying incomplete data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Fourth Learning on Graphs Conference (LoG 2025)</p></details> |

GNNs have close connections to logic. In particular, their expressive power is linked to that of modal logics and bounded-variable logics with counting. In many practical scenarios, graphs processed by GNNs have node features that act as unique identifiers. In this work, we study how such identifiers affect the expressive power of GNNs. We initiate a study of the key-invariant expressive power of GNNs, inspired by the notion of order-invariant definability in finite model theory: which node queries that depend only on the underlying graph structure can GNNs express on graphs with unique node identifiers? We provide answers for various classes of GNNs with local max- or sum-aggregation.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[Embodied Task Planning via Graph-Informed Action Generation with Large Lanaguage Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21841v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot reasoning capabilities, their deployment as embodied agents still faces fundamental challenges in long-horizon planning. Unlike open-ended text generation, embodied agents must decompose high-level intent into actionable sub-goals while strictly adhering to the logic of a dynamic, observed environment. Standard LLM planners frequently fail to maintain strategy coherence over extended horizons due to context window limitation or hallucinate transitions that violate constraints. We propose GiG, a novel planning framework that structures embodied agents' memory using a Graph-in-Graph architecture. Our approach employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode environmental states into embeddings, organizing these embeddings into action-connected execution trace graphs within an experience memory bank. By clustering these graph embeddings, the framework enables retrieval of structure-aware priors, allowing agents to ground current decisions in relevant past structural patterns. Furthermore, we introduce a novel bounded lookahead module that leverages symbolic transition logic to enhance the agents' planning capabilities through the grounded action projection. We evaluate our framework on three embodied planning benchmarks-Robotouille Synchronous, Robotouille Asynchronous, and ALFWorld. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving Pass@1 performance gains of up to 22% on Robotouille Synchronous, 37% on Asynchronous, and 15% on ALFWorld with comparable or lower computational cost.</p></details> |  |

Despite its influence, this perspective leaves two gaps: (i) it is unclear whether WL tests are sufficiently primitive for understanding GNN expressivity, and (ii) WL-induced equivalence does not align well with characterizing the function classes that GNNs can approximate or compute. We attempt to address both gaps. First, we strengthen hardness results for the vanilla WL test, showing that in many settings it is not primitive enough to be implemented by constant-depth GNNs. Second, we propose an alternative framework for studying GNN expressivity based on an extended CONGEST model with an explicit preprocessing phase. Within this framework, we identify implicit shortcuts introduced in prior analyses and establish further results for WL tests in settings where graphs are augmented with virtual nodes and virtual edges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Parameter Finetuning: Test-Time Representation Refinement for Node Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21615v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks frequently exhibit significant performance degradation in the out-of-distribution test scenario. While test-time training (TTT) offers a promising solution, existing Parameter Finetuning (PaFT) paradigm suffer from catastrophic forgetting, hindering their real-world applicability. We propose TTReFT, a novel Test-Time Representation FineTuning framework that transitions the adaptation target from model parameters to latent representations. Specifically, TTReFT achieves this through three key innovations: (1) uncertainty-guided node selection for specific interventions, (2) low-rank representation interventions that preserve pre-trained knowledge, and (3) an intervention-aware masked autoencoder that dynamically adjust masking strategy to accommodate the node selection scheme. Theoretically, we establish guarantees for TTReFT in OOD settings. Empirically, extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTReFT achieves consistent and superior performance. Our work establishes representation finetuning as a new paradigm for graph TTT, offering both theoretical grounding and immediate practical utility for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneity-Aware Knowledge Sharing for Graph Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21589v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Federated Learning (GFL) enables distributed graph representation learning while protecting the privacy of graph data. However, GFL suffers from heterogeneity arising from diverse node features and structural topologies across multiple clients. To address both types of heterogeneity, we propose a novel graph Federated learning method via Semantic and Structural Alignment (FedSSA), which shares the knowledge of both node features and structural topologies. For node feature heterogeneity, we propose a novel variational model to infer class-wise node distributions, so that we can cluster clients based on inferred distributions and construct cluster-level representative distributions. We then minimize the divergence between local and cluster-level distributions to facilitate semantic knowledge sharing. For structural heterogeneity, we employ spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and propose a spectral energy measure to characterize structural information, so that we can cluster clients based on spectral energy and build cluster-level spectral GNNs. We then align the spectral characteristics of local spectral GNNs with those of cluster-level spectral GNNs to enable structural knowledge sharing. Experiments on six homophilic and five heterophilic graph datasets under both non-overlapping and overlapping partitioning settings demonstrate that FedSSA consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 33 pages |
| **[Mean-Field Control on Sparse Graphs: From Local Limits to GNNs via Neighborhood Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21477v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mean-field control (MFC) offers a scalable solution to the curse of dimensionality in multi-agent systems but traditionally hinges on the restrictive assumption of exchangeability via dense, all-to-all interactions. In this work, we bridge the gap to real-world network structures by proposing a rigorous framework for MFC on large sparse graphs. We redefine the system state as a probability measure over decorated rooted neighborhoods, effectively capturing local heterogeneity. Our central contribution is a theoretical foundation for scalable reinforcement learning in this setting. We prove horizon-dependent locality: for finite-horizon problems, an agent's optimal policy at time t depends strictly on its (T-t)-hop neighborhood. This result renders the infinite-dimensional control problem tractable and underpins a novel Dynamic Programming Principle (DPP) on the lifted space of neighborhood distributions. Furthermore, we formally and experimentally justify the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for actor-critic algorithms in this context. Our framework naturally recovers classical MFC as a degenerate case while enabling efficient, theoretically grounded control on complex sparse topologies.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Rethinking Federated Graph Foundation Models: A Graph-Language Alignment-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21369v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies of federated graph foundational models (FedGFMs) break the idealized and untenable assumption of having centralized data storage to train graph foundation models, and accommodate the reality of distributed, privacy-restricted data silos. Despite their simplicity and intuition, existing studies that project aligned generalizable knowledge onto a discrete token space via vector-quantized backbones suffer from irreversible knowledge loss during the quantization process. In this context, we argue that reconciling the semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity between pre-trained language models (PLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) is paramount for developing effective FedGFMs while simultaneously mitigating the severe data heterogeneity and communication constraints inherent in distributed, resource-limited environments. To address these issues, we propose FedGALA (Federated Graph And Language Alignment), a framework that resolves graph-based semantic-structural orthogonality and integrity in federated settings by employing unsupervised contrastive learning to align GNNs and frozen PLMs within a continuous embedding space, thereby capturing robust, transferable general knowledge. Subsequently, FedGALA leverages a communication-efficient prompt tuning mechanism to steer these pre-aligned encoders and frozen PLMs, facilitating effective adaptation to diverse downstream tasks while circumventing the prohibitive overhead of full-parameter fine-tuning. The comprehensive experiments validate that FedGALA outperforms all competitive baselines across multi-domain datasets on multiple tasks with up to 14.37% performance improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review.

Trained with reinforcement learning (RL), the state-of-the-art graph attention model (GAM) achieves near-optimal solutions without requiring expert knowledge or labeled data. In this work, we generalize the existing graph attention mechanism and propose the extended graph attention model (EGAM). Our model utilizes multi-head dot-product attention to update both node and edge embeddings, addressing the limitations of the conventional GAM, which considers only node features. We employ an autoregressive encoder-decoder architecture and train it with policy gradient algorithms that incorporate a specially designed baseline. Experiments show that EGAM matches or outperforms existing methods across various routing problems. Notably, the proposed model demonstrates exceptional performance on highly constrained problems, highlighting its efficiency in handling complex graph structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fair Graph Machine Learning under Adversarial Missingness Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01591v5)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in many relevant tasks where decisions might disproportionately impact specific communities. However, existing work on fair GNNs often assumes that either sensitive attributes are fully observed or they are missing completely at random. We show that an adversarial missingness process can inadvertently disguise a fair model through the imputation, leading the model to overestimate the fairness of its predictions. We address this challenge by proposing Better Fair than Sorry (BFtS), a fair missing data imputation model for sensitive attributes. The key principle behind BFtS is that imputations should approximate the worst-case scenario for fairness -- i.e. when optimizing fairness is the hardest. We implement this idea using a 3-player adversarial scheme where two adversaries collaborate against a GNN classifier, and the classifier minimizes the maximum bias. Experiments using synthetic and real datasets show that BFtS often achieves a better fairness x accuracy trade-off than existing alternatives under an adversarial missingness process.</p></details> |  |

Such techniques usually involve solving large, sparse linear systems, where preconditioning methods are critical. In recent years, neural methods, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), have demonstrated their potential through accelerated convergence. Nonetheless, to extract connective structures, existing techniques aggregate discretized system matrices into graphs, and suffer from rank inflation and a suboptimal convergence rate. In this paper, we articulate NeuraLSP, a novel neural preconditioner combined with a novel loss metric that leverages the left singular subspace of the system matrix's near-nullspace vectors. By compressing spectral information into a fixed low-rank operator, our method exhibits both theoretical guarantees and empirical robustness to rank inflation, affording up to a 53% speedup. Besides the theoretical guarantees for our newly-formulated loss function, our comprehensive experimental results across diverse families of PDEs also substantiate the aforementioned theoretical advances.</p></details> |  |

We build paired citation graphs, ground truth and GPT-4o-generated (from parametric knowledge), for 10,000 focal papers ($\approx$ 275k references) from SciSciNet, and added a field-matched random baseline that preserves out-degree and field distributions while breaking latent structure. We compare (i) structure-only node features (degree/closeness/eigenvector centrality, clustering, edge count) with (ii) 3072-D title/abstract embeddings, using an RF on graph-level aggregates and Graph Neural Networks with node features. Structure alone barely separates GPT from ground truth (RF accuracy $\approx$ 0.60) despite cleanly rejecting the random baseline ($\approx$ 0.89--0.92). By contrast, embeddings sharply increase separability: RF on aggregated embeddings reaches $\approx$ 0.83, and GNNs with embedding node features achieve 93\% test accuracy on GPT vs.\ ground truth. We show the robustness of our findings by replicating the pipeline with Claude Sonnet 4.5 and with multiple embedding models (OpenAI and SPECTER), with RF separability for ground truth vs.\ Claude $\approx 0.77$ and clean rejection of the random baseline. Thus, LLM bibliographies, generated purely from parametric knowledge, closely mimic human citation topology, but leave detectable semantic fingerprints; detection and debiasing should target content signals rather than global graph structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 20 figures.

However, large-scale networks present unique challenges: they contain hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges with heterogeneous and overlapping community structures that evolve over time. Existing approaches face notable limitations: traditional graph neural networks struggle to capture global structural dependencies, while recent graph transformers achieve strong performance but incur quadratic complexity and lack interpretable latent structure. We propose \textbf{TGSBM} (Transformer-Guided Stochastic Block Model), a framework that integrates the principled generative structure of Overlapping Stochastic Block Models with the representational power of sparse Graph Transformers. TGSBM comprises three main components: (i) \emph{expander-augmented sparse attention} that enables near-linear complexity and efficient global mixing, (ii) a \emph{neural variational encoder} that infers structured posteriors over community memberships and strengths, and (iii) a \emph{neural edge decoder} that reconstructs links via OSBM's generative process, preserving interpretability. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance (mean rank 1.6 under HeaRT protocol), superior scalability (up to $6\times$ faster training), and interpretable community structures. These results position TGSBM as a practical approach that strikes a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and transparency for large-scale link prediction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Taxonomy of reduction matrices for Graph Coarsening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11743v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix, which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened graphs.</p></details> |  |

Although combinatorial complexes offer a unified topological framework, most existing topological deep learning methods rely on local message passing via attention mechanisms, which incur quadratic complexity and remain low-dimensional, limiting scalability and rank-aware information aggregation in higher-order complexes.We propose Combinatorial Complex Mamba (CCMamba), the first unified mamba-based neural framework for learning on combinatorial complexes. CCMamba reformulates message passing as a selective state-space modeling problem by organizing multi-rank incidence relations into structured sequences processed by rank-aware state-space models. This enables adaptive, directional, and long range information propagation in linear time without self attention. We further establish the theoretical analysis that the expressive power upper-bound of CCMamba message passing is the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Experiments on graph, hypergraph, and simplicial benchmarks demonstrate that CCMamba consistently outperforms existing methods while exhibiting improved scalability and robustness to depth.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show that GCL-OT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

These methods enrich user representations by incorporating social network information into GCF, thereby integrating additional collaborative signals from social relations. However, existing GCF and graph-based SocialRec approaches face significant challenges: they incur high computational costs and suffer from limited scalability due to the large number of parameters required to assign explicit embeddings to all users and items. In this work, we propose PULSE (Parameter-efficient User representation Learning with Social Knowledge), a framework that addresses this limitation by constructing user representations from socially meaningful signals without creating an explicit learnable embedding for each user.

| **[Proactive SFC Provisioning with Forecast-Driven DRL in Data Centers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20229v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service Function Chaining (SFC) requires efficient placement of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) to satisfy diverse service requirements while maintaining high resource utilization in Data Centers (DCs). Conventional static resource allocation often leads to overprovisioning or underprovisioning due to the dynamic nature of traffic loads and application demands. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid forecast-driven Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines predictive intelligence with SFC provisioning. Specifically, we leverage DRL to generate datasets capturing DC resource utilization and service demands, which are then used to train deep learning forecasting models. Using Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization, the best-performing models, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network, Temporal Graph Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory, are combined into an ensemble to enhance stability and accuracy. The ensemble predictions are integrated into the DC selection process, enabling proactive placement decisions that consider both current and future resource availability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only sustains high acceptance ratios for resource-intensive services such as Cloud Gaming and VoIP but also significantly improves acceptance ratios for latency-critical categories such as Augmented Reality increases from 30% to 50%, while Industry 4.0 improves from 30% to 45%. Consequently, the prediction-based model achieves significantly lower E2E latencies of 20.5%, 23.8%, and 34.8% reductions for VoIP, Video Streaming, and Cloud Gaming, respectively. This strategy ensures more balanced resource allocation, and reduces contention.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) 2026</p></details> |
| **[The Effect of Architecture During Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19766v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is a challenge for models with static architecture, as they fail to adapt to when data distributions evolve across tasks. We introduce a mathematical framework that jointly models architecture and weights in a Sobolev space, enabling a rigorous investigation into the role of neural network architecture in continual learning and its effect on the forgetting loss. We derive necessary conditions for the continual learning solution and prove that learning only model weights is insufficient to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under distribution shifts. Consequently, we prove that by learning the architecture and weights simultaneously at each task, we can reduce catastrophic forgetting. To learn weights and architecture simultaneously, we formulate continual learning as a bilevel optimization problem: the upper level selects an optimal architecture for a given task, while the lower level computes optimal weights via dynamic programming over all tasks. To solve the upper level problem, we introduce a derivative-free direct search algorithm to determine the optimal architecture. Once found, we must transfer knowledge from the current architecture to the optimal one. However, the optimal architecture will result in a weights parameter space different from the current architecture (i.e., dimensions of weights matrices will not match). To bridge the dimensionality gap, we develop a low-rank transfer mechanism to map knowledge across architectures of mismatched dimensions. Empirical studies across regression and classification problems, including feedforward, convolutional, and graph neural networks, demonstrate that learning the optimal architecture and weights simultaneously yields substantially improved performance (up to two orders of magnitude), reduced forgetting, and enhanced robustness to noise compared with static architecture approaches.</p></details> |  |

Labelling remote sensing imagery is time and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work, we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be formed within the encoding space. Our pipeline achieves high contextual consistency, with similarity scores of SSIM = 0.96 and SAM = 0.21 under context-aware evaluation, demonstrating robust organisation of the feature space for interactive labelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Taylor and Francis, Annals of GIS * Video supplement demonstrating feature-space exploration and interactive labelling is available at: https://youtu.be/GZl1ebZJgEA and is archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16676591</p></details> |

There is a growing need for scalable algorithms capable of handling the increasing variability, constraints, and uncertainties in modern power networks while providing accurate and fast solutions. To address this, machine learning techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising approaches. This letter introduces PowerGraph-LLM, the first framework explicitly designed for solving OPF problems using Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed approach combines graph and tabular representations of power grids to effectively query LLMs, capturing the complex relationships and constraints in power systems. A new implementation of in-context learning and fine-tuning protocols for LLMs is introduced, tailored specifically for the OPF problem. PowerGraph-LLM demonstrates reliable performances using off-the-shelf LLM. Our study reveals the impact of LLM architecture, size, and fine-tuning and demonstrates our framework's ability to handle realistic grid components and constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IEEE Transactions on Power Systems</p></details> |

We challenge this view by introducing Fixed Aggregation Features (FAFs), a training-free approach that transforms graph learning tasks into tabular problems. This simple shift enables the use of well-established tabular methods, offering strong interpretability and the flexibility to deploy diverse classifiers. Across 14 benchmarks, well-tuned multilayer perceptrons trained on FAFs rival or outperform state-of-the-art GNNs and graph transformers on 12 tasks -- often using only mean aggregation. The only exceptions are the Roman Empire and Minesweeper datasets, which typically require unusually deep GNNs. To explain the theoretical possibility of non-trainable aggregations, we connect our findings to Kolmogorov-Arnold representations and discuss when mean aggregation can be sufficient. In conclusion, our results call for (i) richer benchmarks benefiting from learning diverse neighborhood aggregations, (ii) strong tabular baselines as standard, and (iii) employing and advancing tabular models for graph data to gain new insights into related tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphSB: Boosting Imbalanced Node Classification on Graphs through Structural Balance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19352v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither of them addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 4.57%.</p></details> |  |

The Kuramoto layer models neural synchronization over anatomical connections, generating phase-informed embeddings that capture structure-function coupling, while cognitive scores modulate information routing in a subject-specific manner followed by a joint objective enhancing robustness under class imbalance scenario.

| **[Traffic Engineering in Large-scale Networks with Generalizable Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24203v2)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Engineering (TE) in large-scale networks like cloud Wide Area Networks (WANs) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations is a critical challenge. Although learning-based approaches have been proposed to address the scalability of traditional TE algorithms, their practical application is often hindered by a lack of generalization, high training overhead, and a failure to respect link capacities. This paper proposes TELGEN, a novel TE algorithm that learns to solve TE problems efficiently in large-scale network scenarios, while achieving superior generalizability across diverse network conditions. TELGEN is based on the novel idea of transforming the problem of "predicting the optimal TE solution" into "predicting the optimal TE algorithm", which enables TELGEN to learn and efficiently approximate the end-to-end solving process of classical optimal TE algorithms. The learned algorithm is agnostic to the exact underlying network topology or traffic patterns, and is able to very efficiently solve TE problems given arbitrary inputs and generalize well to unseen topologies and demands. We train and evaluate TELGEN with random and real-world topologies, with networks of up to 5000 nodes and 3.6x10^6 links in testing. TELGEN shows less than 3% optimality gap while ensuring feasibility in all testing scenarios, even when the test network has 2-20x more nodes than the largest training network. It also saves up to 84% TE solving time than traditional interior-point method, and reduces up to 79.6% training time per epoch than the state-of-the-art learning-based algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE Transactions on Networking</p></details> |

We introduce cross-graph inter-message passing (XIMP), which performs message passing both within and across multiple related graph representations. For small molecules, we combine the molecular graph with scaffold-aware junction trees and pharmacophore-encoding extended reduced graphs, integrating complementary abstractions. While prior work is either limited to a single abstraction or non-iterative communication across graphs, XIMP supports an arbitrary number of abstractions and both direct and indirect communication between them in each layer. Across ten diverse molecular property prediction tasks, XIMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in most cases, leveraging interpretable abstractions as an inductive bias that guides learning toward established chemical concepts, enhancing generalization in low-data settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Graph Neural Networks for Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02531v4)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASEHybrid: When Geometry Matters Beyond Homophily in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18912v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle on graphs with low homophily, yet homophily alone does not explain this behavior, as graphs with similar homophily levels can exhibit markedly different performance and some heterophilous graphs remain easy for vanilla GCNs. Recent work suggests that label informativeness (LI), the mutual information between labels of adjacent nodes, provides a more faithful characterization of when graph structure is useful. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that connects curvature-guided rewiring and positional geometry through the lens of label informativeness, and instantiate it in a practical geometry-aware architecture, ASEHybrid. Our analysis provides a necessary-and-sufficient characterization of when geometry-aware GNNs can improve over feature-only baselines: such gains are possible if and only if graph structure carries label-relevant information beyond node features. Theoretically, we relate adjusted homophily and label informativeness to the spectral behavior of label signals under Laplacian smoothing, show that degree-based Forman curvature does not increase expressivity beyond the one-dimensional Weisfeiler--Lehman test but instead reshapes information flow, and establish convergence and Lipschitz stability guarantees for a curvature-guided rewiring process. Empirically, we instantiate ASEHybrid using Forman curvature and Laplacian positional encodings and conduct controlled ablations on Chameleon, Squirrel, Texas, Tolokers, and Minesweeper, observing gains precisely on label-informative heterophilous benchmarks where graph structure provides label-relevant information beyond node features, and no meaningful improvement in high-baseline regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |

The architecture of an RS model acts as an inductive bias, shaping the patterns the model is inclined to learn. In recent years, numerous recommendation architectures have emerged, spanning traditional matrix factorization, deep neural networks, and graph neural networks. However, their designs are often not explicitly aligned with the top-K objective, thereby limiting their effectiveness. To address this limitation, we propose TopKGAT, a novel recommendation architecture directly derived from a differentiable approximation of top-K metrics. The forward computation of a single TopKGAT layer is intrinsically aligned with the gradient ascent dynamics of the Precision@K metric, enabling the model to naturally improve top-K recommendation accuracy. Structurally, TopKGAT resembles a graph attention network and can be implemented efficiently. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that TopKGAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS): A Unified Spectral Topology Framework for Stability in Turbulence, AI, and Biology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11594v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex dynamical systems frequently encounter a recurrent structural instability: the collapse of the spectral gap, driving the system toward a low-dimensional "Zero-Mode Attractor" (e.g., spectral pile-up or over-smoothing). Building upon recent global well-posedness estimates [Hou, arXiv:2601.00638], this work generalizes the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information System (MNCIS) framework. We postulate that global stability requires an active topological operator - Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) - functioning as a state-dependent high-pass filter that penalizes entropy accumulation at spectral boundaries. We validate this unified framework via three implementations: (1) Hydrodynamics: In 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence ($N=256^3$), ASNC acts as a global-enstrophy adaptive sub-grid scale (SGS) model, stabilizing the inviscid limit and preserving the Kolmogorov $-5/3$ inertial range without artificial hyper-viscosity. Crucially, we verify that the operator remains dormant ($γ\approx 0$) during the linear growth phase of physical instabilities, functioning strictly as a conditional topological clamp. (2) Artificial Intelligence: Addressing Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we implement ASNC as a parameter-free topological constraint. Unlike baselines (e.g., DeepGCNs) relying on dense residual connections, our framework enables the training of ultra-deep 64-layer networks without residual connections, maintaining perfectly stationary feature variance ($σ^2 \equiv 1.0$) on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark. (3) Biological Physics: In reaction-diffusion morphogenesis, it stabilizes Turing patterns against diffusive washout in high-entropy regimes. Our results suggest that the MNCIS framework provides a base-independent topological condition for distinguishing viable complex systems from those collapsing into thermal equilibrium.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inclu...</summary><p>Includes supplementary materials and code.

Existing GNN explanations typically apply input perturbations to identify subgraphs that are responsible for the occurrence of the final output of GNNs. However, such approaches lack finer-grained, layer-wise analysis of how intermediate representations contribute to the final result, capabilities that are crucial for model diagnosis and architecture optimization. This paper introduces SliceGX, a novel GNN explanation approach that generates explanations at specific GNN layers in a progressive manner. Given a GNN model M, a set of selected intermediate layers, and a target layer, SliceGX slices M into layer blocks("model slice") and discovers high-quality explanatory subgraphs within each block that elucidate how the model output arises at the target layer. Although finding such layer-wise explanations is computationally challenging, we develop efficient algorithms and optimization techniques that incrementally construct and maintain these subgraphs with provable approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SliceGX, and illustrate its practical utility in supporting model debugging.</p></details> |  |

The integration of quantum computing with GNNs offers a promising pathway for enhancing computational efficiency because they reduce the model complexity. This is achieved by leveraging the quantum advantages of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), while retaining the expressive power of GNNs. However, existing pure quantum message passing models remain constrained by the limited number of qubits, hence limiting the scalability of their application to the wireless systems. As a remedy, we conceive a Scalable Quantum Message Passing Graph Neural Network (SQM-GNN) relying on a quantum message passing architecture. To address the aforementioned scalability issue, we decompose the graph into subgraphs and apply a shared PQC to each local subgraph. Importantly, the model incorporates both node and edge features, facilitating the full representation of the underlying wireless graph structure. We demonstrate the efficiency of SQM GNN on a device-to-device (D2D) power control task, where it outperforms both classical GNNs and heuristic baselines. These results highlight SQM-GNN as a promising direction for future wireless network optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, and 3 tables.

We identify three key gaps: (1) dietary pattern studies often ignore real-world constraints such as socioeconomic status, comorbidities, and limited food access; (2) recommendation systems rarely explain why a particular food helps a given patient; and (3) no unified benchmark evaluates methods across the connected tasks needed for nutritional interventions. We introduce GLEN-Bench, the first comprehensive graph-language based benchmark for nutritional health assessment. We combine NHANES health records, FNDDS food composition data, and USDA food-access metrics to build a knowledge graph that links demographics, health conditions, dietary behaviors, poverty-related constraints, and nutrient needs. We test the benchmark using opioid use disorder, where models must detect subtle nutritional differences across disease stages. GLEN-Bench includes three linked tasks: risk detection identifies at-risk individuals from dietary and socioeconomic patterns; recommendation suggests personalized foods that meet clinical needs within resource constraints; and question answering provides graph-grounded, natural-language explanations to facilitate comprehension. We evaluate these graph-language approaches, including graph neural networks, large language models, and hybrid architectures, to establish solid baselines and identify practical design choices. Our analysis identifies clear dietary patterns linked to health risks, providing insights that can guide practical interventions.</p></details> |  |

Each node caches samples from others and communicates over wireless collision channels, aiming to minimize time-average estimation error via decentralized policies. Due to the high dimensionality of action spaces and complexity of network topologies, deriving optimal policies analytically is intractable. To address this, we propose a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for policy optimization. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed policies are transferable, allowing a policy trained on one graph to be effectively applied to structurally similar graphs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed policy outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) the trained policies are transferable to larger networks, with performance gains increasing with the number of agents; (iii) the graphical training procedure withstands non-stationarity, even when using independent learning techniques; and (iv) recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches require either sharing sensitive transaction data or operating in isolation, leaving critical cross-chain laundering patterns undetected. We present FedGraph-VASP, a privacy-preserving federated graph learning framework that enables collaborative anti-money laundering (AML) without exposing raw user data. Our key contribution is a Boundary Embedding Exchange protocol that shares only compressed, non-invertible graph neural network representations of boundary accounts. These exchanges are secured using post-quantum cryptography, specifically the NIST-standardized Kyber-512 key encapsulation mechanism combined with AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption. Experiments on the Elliptic Bitcoin dataset with realistic Louvain partitioning show that FedGraph-VASP achieves an F1-score of 0.508, outperforming the state-of-the-art generative baseline FedSage+ (F1 = 0.453) by 12.1 percent on binary fraud detection. We further show robustness under low-connectivity settings where generative imputation degrades performance, while approaching centralized performance (F1 = 0.620) in high-connectivity regimes. We additionally evaluate generalization on an Ethereum fraud detection dataset, where FedGraph-VASP (F1 = 0.635) is less effective under sparse cross-silo connectivity, while FedSage+ excels (F1 = 0.855), outperforming even local training (F1 = 0.785). These results highlight a topology-dependent trade-off: embedding exchange benefits connected transaction graphs, whereas generative imputation can dominate in highly modular sparse graphs. A privacy audit shows embeddings are only partially invertible (R^2 = 0.32), limiting exact feature recovery.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present Convexified Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks (CGNNs), a novel and general framework that combines the power of message-passing GNNs with the tractability of convex optimization. By mapping their nonlinear filters into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, CGNNs transform training into a convex optimization problem, which projected gradient methods can solve both efficiently and optimally. Convexity further allows CGNNs' statistical properties to be analyzed accurately and rigorously. For two-layer CGNNs, we establish rigorous generalization guarantees, showing convergence to the performance of an optimal GNN. To scale to deeper architectures, we adopt a principled layer-wise training strategy. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CGNNs significantly exceed the performance of leading GNN models, obtaining 10-40% higher accuracy in most cases, underscoring their promise as a powerful and principled method with strong theoretical foundations. In rare cases where improvements are not quantitatively substantial, the convex models either slightly exceed or match the baselines, stressing their robustness and wide applicability. Though over-parameterization is often used to enhance performance in non-convex models, we show that our CGNNs yield shallow convex models that can surpass non-convex ones in accuracy and model compactness.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in 29th Annual Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), 2026</p></details> |

Kolmogorov-Arnold Graph Neural Networks (KAGNNs) expand on the existing set of GNN models with KAN-based counterparts. KAGNNs have been demonstrably successful in surpassing the accuracy of MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP)-based GNNs in the task of molecular property prediction. These models were widely tested on the graph datasets consisting of organic molecules. In this study, we explore the application of KAGNNs towards inorganic nanomaterials. In 2024, a large scale inorganic nanomaterials dataset was published under the title CHILI (Chemically-Informed Large-scale Inorganic Nanomaterials Dataset), and various MLP-based GNNs have been tested on this dataset. We adapt and test our own KAGNNs appropriate for eight defined tasks. Our experiments reveal that, KAGNNs frequently surpass the performance of their counterpart GNNs. Most notably, on crystal system and space group classification tasks in CHILI-3K, KAGNNs achieve the new state-of-the-art results of 99.5 percent and 96.6 percent accuracy, respectively, compared to the previous 65.7 and 73.3 percent each.</p></details> |  |

This neighbor explosion problem requires workers to frequently exchange boundary node features across partitions, creating a communication bottleneck that severely limits training scalability. Existing approaches rely on static graph partitioning strategies that cannot adapt to dynamic network conditions. In this paper, we propose CondenseGraph, a novel communication-efficient framework for distributed GNN training. Our key innovation is an on-the-fly graph condensation mechanism that dynamically compresses boundary node features into compact super nodes before transmission. To compensate for the information loss introduced by compression, we develop a gradient-based error feedback mechanism that maintains convergence guarantees while reducing communication volume by 40-60%. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that CondenseGraph achieves comparable accuracy to full-precision baselines while significantly reducing communication costs and training time.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either focus on pixel-level fusion while overlooking downstream task adaptability or implicitly learn rigid semantics through cascaded detection/segmentation models, unable to interactively address diverse semantic target perception needs. We propose CtrlFuse, a controllable image fusion framework that enables interactive dynamic fusion guided by mask prompts. The model integrates a multi-modal feature extractor, a reference prompt encoder (RPE), and a prompt-semantic fusion module (PSFM). The RPE dynamically encodes task-specific semantic prompts by fine-tuning pre-trained segmentation models with input mask guidance, while the PSFM explicitly injects these semantics into fusion features. Through synergistic optimization of parallel segmentation and fusion branches, our method achieves mutual enhancement between task performance and fusion quality. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in both fusion controllability and segmentation accuracy, with the adapted task branch even outperforming the original segmentation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages,22 figures,published to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

This paper presents MPBS (Mobility-aware Prediction and Behavior-based Scheduling), a scalable task recruitment framework that treats each device as a recruitable "user". MPBS integrates three key modules: a behavior-aware KNN classifier, a time-varying Markov prediction model for forecasting device mobility, and a dynamic priority scheduling mechanism that considers task urgency and base station performance. By combining behavioral classification with spatiotemporal prediction, MPBS adaptively assigns tasks to the most suitable devices in real time. Experimental evaluations on the real-world GeoLife dataset show that MPBS significantly improves task completion efficiency and resource utilization. The proposed framework offers a predictive, behavior-aware solution for intelligent and collaborative scheduling in unmanned systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A K-means Inspired Solution Framework for Large-Scale Multi-Traveling Salesman Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19454v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Multi-Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) is a commonly used mathematical model for multi-agent task allocation. However, as the number of agents and task targets increases, existing optimization-based methods often incur prohibitive computational costs, posing significant challenges to large-scale coordination in unmanned systems. To address this issue, this paper proposes a K-means-inspired task allocation framework that reformulates the MTSP as a spatially constrained classification process. By leveraging spatial coherence, the proposed method enables fast estimation of path costs and efficient task grouping, thereby fundamentally reducing overall computational complexity. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the framework can maintain high solution quality even in extremely large-scale scenarios-for instance, in tasks involving 1000 agents and 5000 targets. The findings indicate that this "cluster-then-route" decomposition strategy offers an efficient and reliable solution for large-scale multi-agent task allocation.</p></details> |  |

Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched because of its low-cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges of poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded systems. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation model, BoRe-Depth, which contains only 8.7M parameters.

Secondly, we integrate semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve the object recognition and boundary perception capabilities. Finally, BoRe-Depth is deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, and runs efficiently at 50.7 FPS.

Existing underwater diver communication methods face hurdles due to inherent disadvantages and complex underwater environments. To address this issue, we propose a scheme that utilizes maritime unmanned systems to assist divers with reliable and high-speed communication. Multiple AUVs are equipped with optical and acoustic multimodal communication devices as relay nodes, providing adaptive communication services based on changes in the diver's activity area. By using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to control the cooperative movement of AUVs, high-speed and reliable data transmission between divers can be achieved. At the same time, utilizing the advantages of on-demand deployment and wide coverage of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) as surface relay nodes to coordinate and forward information from AUVs, and controlling AUVs to adaptively select relay USV nodes for data transmission, high-quality communication between divers and surface platform can be achieved. Through simulation verification, the proposed scheme can effectively achieve reliable and high-speed communication for divers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn to reorganize and extend the current findings in a future version</p></details> |

However, limited communication bandwidth and the need for high-frequency interactions pose severe challenges to semantic information transmission within the swarm. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM-driven UAV swarms for autonomous semantic compression communication, aiming to reduce communication load while preserving critical task semantics. To this end, we construct four types of 2D simulation scenarios with different levels of environmental complexity and design a communication-execution pipeline that integrates system prompts with task instruction prompts. On this basis, we systematically evaluate the semantic compression performance of nine mainstream LLMs in different scenarios and analyze their adaptability and stability through ablation studies on environmental complexity and swarm size. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-based UAV swarms have the potential to achieve efficient collaborative communication under bandwidth-constrained and multi-hop link conditions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce MorphEUS, a morphable co-axial quadrotor that can control position and orientation independently with high efficiency. It uses a paired servo motor mechanism for each rotor arm, capable of pointing the vectored-thrust in any arbitrary direction. As compared to the \textit{state-of-the-art} OMAVs, we achieve higher and more uniform force/torque reachability with a smaller footprint and minimum thrust cancellations. The overactuated nature of the system also results in resiliency to rotor or servo-motor failures. The capabilities of this quadrotor are particularly well-suited for contact-based infrastructure inspection and close-proximity imaging of complex geometries. In the accompanying control pipeline, we present theoretical results for full controllability, almost-everywhere exponential stability, and thrust-energy optimality. We evaluate our design and controller on high-fidelity simulations showcasing the trajectory-tracking capabilities of the vehicle during various tasks.

Today, heterogeneous air-ground collaborative multi-agent framework, which comprise unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), have presented superior flexibility and efficiency compared to traditional homogeneous frameworks in complex sensing tasks. Within this context, task allocation among different agents always play an important role in improving overall MCS quality. In order to better allocate tasks among heterogeneous collaborative agents, in this paper, we investigated two representative complex multi-agent task allocation scenarios with dual optimization objectives: (1) For AG-FAMT (Air-Ground Few Agents More Tasks) scenario, the objectives are to maximize the task completion while minimizing the total travel distance; (2) For AG-MAFT (Air-Ground More Agents Few Tasks) scenario, where the agents are allocated based on their locations, has the optimization objectives of minimizing the total travel distance while reducing travel time cost. To achieve this, we proposed a Multi-Task Minimum Cost Maximum Flow (MT-MCMF) optimization algorithm tailored for AG-FAMT, along with a multi-objective optimization algorithm called W-ILP designed for AG-MAFT, with a particular focus on optimizing the charging path planning of UAVs. Our experiments based on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrated that the proposed two algorithms both outperform baseline approaches under varying experimental settings, including task quantity, task difficulty, and task distribution, providing a novel way to improve the overall quality of mobile crowdsensing tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing unmanned systems often rely on GPS-based navigation, which is prone to inaccuracies in rural areas and limits flight paths to predefined routes, resulting in operational inefficiencies. To address these challenges, this paper presents ForaNav, an insect-inspired navigation strategy for autonomous navigation in plantations. The proposed method employs an enhanced Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG)-based tree detection approach, integrating hue-saturation histograms and global HOG feature variance with hierarchical HOG extraction to distinguish oil palm trees from visually similar objects. Inspired by insect foraging behavior, the MAV dynamically adjusts its path based on detected trees and employs a recovery mechanism to stay on course if a target is temporarily lost. We demonstrate that our detection method generalizes well to different tree types while maintaining lower CPU usage, lower temperature, and higher FPS than lightweight deep learning models, making it well-suited for real-time applications. Flight test results across diverse real-world scenarios show that the MAV successfully detects and approaches all trees without prior tree location, validating its effectiveness for agricultural automation.</p></details> |  |

Recently, infrared sensors have been widely deployed on mobile and stationary platforms for detection and classification of objects from long distances and in wide field of views. Given its success in the vision image analysis domain, deep learning has also been applied for object recognition in infrared images. However, techniques that have proven successful in visible light perception face new challenges in the infrared domain. These challenges include extremely low signal-to-noise ratios in infrared images, very small and blurred objects of interest, and limited availability of labeled/unlabeled training data due to the specialized nature of infrared sensors. Numerous methods have been proposed in the literature for the detection and classification of small objects in infrared images achieving varied levels of success. There is a need for a survey paper that critically analyzes existing techniques in this domain, identifies unsolved challenges and provides future research directions. This paper fills the gap and offers a concise and insightful review of deep learning-based methods.

Current SLAM systems can achieve centimeter-level accuracy within a short period. However, there are still several challenges when dealing with largescale mapping tasks including significant storage requirements and difficulty of reusing the constructed maps. To address this, we first design an elastic and lightweight map representation called CELLmap, composed of several CELLs, each representing the local map at the corresponding location. Then, we design a general backend including CELL-based bidirectional registration module and loop closure detection module to improve global map consistency. Our experiments have demonstrated that CELLmap can represent the precise geometric structure of large-scale maps of KITTI dataset using only about 60 MB. Additionally, our general backend achieves up to a 26.88% improvement over various LiDAR odometry methods.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Over the last 55 years, Singapore has become an established purchaser of U.S. defense technology, but the past 20 years have also seen the U.S.-Singapore relationship mature into an increasingly collaborative one, tackling newer fields like cybersecurity and biosecurity. However, current geopolitical tensions present a challenge for Singapore, which strives to retain its strategic autonomy by maintaining positive relations with all parties. Paradoxically, the rise of non-traditional security threats may pave the way for greater bilateral cooperation by allowing Singapore to position itself as a hub for cooperation on regional security issues in Southeast Asia at large. In such spirit, this paper recommends that the United States and Singapore do the following: 1) in defense technology, co-develop niche capabilities in C4ISR and unmanned systems with peacetime applications; 2) in cybersecurity, improve their domestic resilience against sophisticated nation-state actors while also building regional capacity to counter cybercrime in Southeast Asia; and 3) in biosecurity, strengthen regional epidemiological surveillance to brace against possible future pandemics.</p></details> | 11 pages |

On one hand, big robotics companies offer training programs based on the job requirements. However, these training programs may not be as beneficial as general robotics programs offered by universities or community colleges. On the other hand, community colleges and universities face challenges with required resources, especially qualified instructors, to offer students advanced robotics education. Furthermore, the diverse backgrounds of undergraduate students present additional challenges. Some students bring extensive industry experiences, while others are newcomers to the field. To address these challenges, we propose a student-centered personalized learning framework for robotics. This framework allows a general instructor to teach undergraduate-level robotics courses by breaking down course topics into smaller components with well-defined topic dependencies, structured as a graph. This modular approach enables students to choose their learning path, catering to their unique preferences and pace. Moreover, our framework's flexibility allows for easy customization of teaching materials to meet the specific needs of host institutions. In addition to teaching materials, a frequently-asked-questions document would be prepared for a general instructor. If students' robotics questions cannot be answered by the instructor, the answers to these questions may be included in this document. For questions not covered in this document, we can gather and address them through collaboration with the robotics community and course content creators. Our user study results demonstrate the promise of this method in delivering undergraduate-level robotics education tailored to individual learning outcomes and preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, 2024 ASEE Conference</p></details> |

The main idea is learning while scheduling, where the collaboration utility is effectively learned with low computation and communication overhead. Case studies are carried out in connected autonomous driving scenarios to verify the proposed framework.

Specifically, we firstly explore the recent technical developments of NS-COM, followed by the discussions about motivations behind integrating NS-COM into SAGSIN. To further demonstrate the necessity of NS-COM, a comparative analysis between the NS-COM network and other counterparts in SAGSIN is conducted, covering aspects of deployment, coverage, channel characteristics and unique problems of NS-COM network. Afterwards, the technical aspects of NS-COM, including channel modeling, random access, channel estimation, array-based beam management and joint network optimization, are examined in detail. Furthermore, we explore the potential applications of NS-COM, such as structural expansion in SAGSIN communication, civil aviation communication, remote and urgent communication, weather monitoring and carbon neutrality.

In particular, the DGVF controller provides a hierarchical architecture of an upper-level heterogeneous guidance velocity controller and a lower-level signal tracking regulator. Therein, the upper-level controller is to govern multiple heterogeneous USVs and UAVs to approach and maneuver along the prescribed paths and coordinate the formation simultaneously, whereas the low-level regulator is to track the corresponding desired guidance signals provided by the upper-level module. Significantly, the heterogeneous coordination among neighboring UAVs and USVs is achieved merely by the lightweight communication of a scalar (i.e., the additional virtual coordinate), which substantially decreases the communication and computational costs. Sufficient conditions assuring asymptotical convergence of the closed-loop system are derived in presence of the exponentially vanishing tracking errors. Finally, real-lake experiments are conducted on a self-established cross-domain heterogeneous platform consisting of three M-100 UAVs, two HUSTER-16 USVs, a HUSTER-12C USV, and a WiFi 5G wireless communication station to verify the effectiveness of the present DGVF controller.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, many existing Simultaneous Localization, Mapping and Moving Object Tracking (SLAMMOT) methods focus solely on estimating specific object poses and lack estimation of object scales and are unable to effectively track unknown objects. In this paper, we propose a novel SLAM backend that unifies ego-motion tracking, rigid object motion tracking, and modeling within a joint optimization framework. In the perception part, we designed a pixel-level asynchronous object tracker (AOT) based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and DeAOT, enabling the tracker to effectively track target unknown objects guided by various predefined tasks and prompts. In the modeling part, we present a novel object-centric quadric parameterization to unify both static and dynamic object initialization and optimization. Subsequently, in the part of object state estimation, we propose a tightly coupled optimization model for object pose and scale estimation, incorporating hybrids constraints into a novel dual sliding window optimization framework for joint estimation. To our knowledge, we are the first to tightly couple object pose tracking with light-weight modeling of dynamic and static objects using quadric. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on simulation datasets and real-world datasets, demonstrating the state-of-the-art robustness and accuracy in motion estimation and modeling. Our system showcases the potential application of object perception in complex dynamic scenes.</p></details> |  |

Unlike general-purpose systems, unmanned systems cannot deploy complete security protection schemes, due to their limitations in size, cost and performance. MCAs in unmanned systems are particularly difficult to defend against. Furthermore, MCAs have diverse and unpredictable attack interfaces in unmanned systems, severely impacting digital and physical sectors. In this paper, we first generalize, model and taxonomize MCAs found in unmanned systems currently, laying the foundation for designing a portable and general defense approach. According to different attack mechanisms, we found that MCAs are mainly categorized into two types--return2libc and return2shellcode. To tackle return2libc attacks, we model the erratic operation of unmanned systems with cycles and then propose a cycle-task-oriented memory protection (CToMP) approach to protect control flows from tampering. To defend against return2shellcode attacks, we introduce a secure process stack with a randomized memory address by leveraging the memory pool to prevent Shellcode from being executed. Moreover, we discuss the mechanism by which CToMP resists the ROP attack, a novel variant of return2libc attacks. Finally, we implement CToMP on CUAV V5+ with Ardupilot and Crazyflie. The evaluation and security analysis results demonstrate that the proposed approach CToMP is resilient to various MCAs in unmanned systems with low footprints and system overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences</p></details> |

In modern operational environments, all job plans are affected by emergency events such as equipment failures and resource shortages, making a quick resolution critical. The use of unmanned systems to assist decision-making can improve resolution efficiency, but their decision-making is not interpretable and may make the wrong decisions. Current unmanned systems require human supervision and control. Based on this, we propose a collaborative human--machine method for resolving unplanned events using two phases: task filtering and task scheduling. In the task filtering phase, we propose a human--machine collaborative decision-making algorithm for dynamic tasks. The GACRNN model is used to predict the state of the job nodes, locate the key nodes, and generate a machine-predicted resolution task list. A human decision-maker supervises the list in real time and modifies and confirms the machine-predicted list through the human--machine interface. In the task scheduling phase, we propose a scheduling algorithm that integrates human experience constraints. The steps to resolve an event are inserted into the normal job sequence to schedule the resolution. We propose several human--machine collaboration methods in each phase to generate steps to resolve an unplanned event while minimizing the impact on the original job plan.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |

However, due to the complexity of unmanned warehouse systems and their susceptibility to errors, incidents may occur during their operation, most often in inbound and outbound operations, which can decrease operational efficiency. Hence it is crucial to to improve the response to such incidents. This paper proposes a collaborative optimization algorithm for emergent incident response based on Safe-MADDPG. To meet safety requirements during emergent incident response, we investigated the intrinsic hidden relationships between various factors. By obtaining constraint information of agents during the emergent incident response process and of the dynamic environment of unmanned warehouses on agents, the algorithm reduces safety risks and avoids the occurrence of chain accidents; this enables an unmanned system to complete emergent incident response tasks and achieve its optimization objectives: (1) minimizing the losses caused by emergent incidents; and (2) maximizing the operational efficiency of inbound and outbound operations during the response process. A series of experiments conducted in a simulated unmanned warehouse scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

It is challenging to perform SLAM in large environments, due to sensor limitations, complexity of the environment, and computational resources. We propose a novel approach for localization and mapping of autonomous vehicles using radio fingerprints, for example WiFi (Wireless Fidelity) or LTE (Long Term Evolution) radio features, which are widely available in the existing infrastructure. In particular, we present two solutions to exploit the radio fingerprints for SLAM. In the first solution-namely Radio SLAM, the output is a radio fingerprint map generated using SLAM technique. In the second solution-namely Radio+LiDAR SLAM, we use radio fingerprint to assist conventional LiDAR-based SLAM to improve accuracy and speed, while generating the occupancy map. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in three different environments, namely outdoor, indoor building, and semi-indoor environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Pervasive Computing with DOI: 10.1109/MPRV.2023.3274770</p></details> |
| **[An Interactively Reinforced Paradigm for Joint Infrared-Visible Image Fusion and Saliency Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09999v1)** | 2023-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research focuses on the discovery and localization of hidden objects in the wild and serves unmanned systems. Through empirical analysis, infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) enables hard-to-find objects apparent, whereas multimodal salient object detection (SOD) accurately delineates the precise spatial location of objects within the picture. Their common characteristic of seeking complementary cues from different source images motivates us to explore the collaborative relationship between Fusion and Salient object detection tasks on infrared and visible images via an Interactively Reinforced multi-task paradigm for the first time, termed IRFS. To the seamless bridge of multimodal image fusion and SOD tasks, we specifically develop a Feature Screening-based Fusion subnetwork (FSFNet) to screen out interfering features from source images, thereby preserving saliency-related features. After generating the fused image through FSFNet, it is then fed into the subsequent Fusion-Guided Cross-Complementary SOD subnetwork (FC$^2$Net) as the third modality to drive the precise prediction of the saliency map by leveraging the complementary information derived from the fused image. In addition, we develop an interactive loop learning strategy to achieve the mutual reinforcement of IVIF and SOD tasks with a shorter training period and fewer network parameters. Comprehensive experiment results demonstrate that the seamless bridge of IVIF and SOD mutually enhances their performance, and highlights their superiority.</p></details> |  |

Current data is fragmented, siloed, and not easily accessible. There is data conflict, misuse, and eroding levels of trust in provenance and accuracy. With increased autonomy in aviation, Artificially Intelligent (AI) enabled unmanned traffic management (UTM) will be more reliant on secure data from diverse stakeholders. There is an urgent need to develop a secure network that has trustworthy data chains and works with the requirements generated by UTM. Here, we review existing research in 3 key interconnected areas: (1) blockchain development for secure data transfer between competing aviation stakeholders, (2) self-learning networking architectures that distribute consensus to achieve secure air traffic control, (3) explainable AI to build trust with human stakeholders and backpropagate requirements for blockchain and network optimisation. When connected together, this new digital ecosystem blueprint is tailored for safety critical UTM sectors. We motivate the readers with a case study, where a federated learning UTM uses real air traffic and weather data is secured and explained to human operators. This emerging area still requires significant research and development by the community to ensure it can enable future autonomous air mobility.</p></details> | under review in IEEE |
| **[Ultra-Fast Accurate AoA Estimation via Automotive Massive-MIMO Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07434v3)** | 2021-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar, enabled by millimeter-wave virtual MIMO techniques, provides great promises to the high-resolution automotive sensing and target detection in unmanned ground/aerial vehicles (UGA/UAV). As a long-established problem, however, existing subspace methods suffer from either high complexity or low accuracy. In this work, we propose two efficient methods, to accomplish fast subspace computation and accurate angle of arrival (AoA) acquisition. By leveraging randomized low-rank approximation, our fast multiple signal classification (MUSIC) methods, relying on random sampling and projection techniques, substantially accelerate the subspace estimation by orders of magnitude. Moreover, we establish the theoretical bounds of our proposed methods, which ensure the accuracy of the approximated pseudo-spectrum. As demonstrated, the pseudo-spectrum acquired by our fast-MUSIC would be highly precise; and the estimated AoA is almost as accurate as standard MUSIC. In contrast, our new methods are tremendously faster than standard MUSIC. Thus, our fast-MUSIC enables the high-resolution real-time environmental sensing with massive MIMO radars, which has great potential in the emerging unmanned systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Randomized-MUSIC for mm-Wave Massive MIMO Radars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04570v1)** | 2021-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subspace methods are essential to high-resolution environment sensing in the emerging unmanned systems, if further combined with the millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technique. The estimation of signal/noise subspace, as one critical step, is yet computationally complex and presents a particular challenge when developing high-resolution yet low-complexity automotive radars. In this work, we develop a fast randomized-MUSIC (R-MUSIC) algorithm, which exploits the random matrix sketching to estimate the signal subspace via approximated computation. Our new approach substantially reduces the time complexity in acquiring a high-quality signal subspace. Moreover, the accuracy of R-MUSIC suffers no degradation unlike others low-complexity counterparts, i.e. the high-resolution angle of arrival (AoA) estimation is attained. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the performance of our R-MUSIC method. As shown, it resolves the long-standing contradiction in complexity and accuracy of MIMO radar signal processing, which hence have great potentials in real-time super-resolution automotive sensing.</p></details> |  |

It means the unmanned system requires a path following algorithm for the completion of the mission. Since the predetermined path is typically given by a set of data-points, not only the curvature and derivative of the pre-determined path are absent, but also it requires a large size of on-board memory. In this work, we study a simple path following algorithm called Carrot-chasing algorithm that uses a simple controller in the form of a proportional controller to control the movement of an unmanned system.</p></details> |  |
| **[P3-LOAM: PPP/LiDAR Loosely Coupled SLAM with Accurate Covariance Estimation and Robust RAIM in Urban Canyon Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02399v1)** | 2020-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has drawn increasing interests in autonomous driving. However, LiDAR-SLAM suffers from accumulating errors which can be significantly mitigated by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Precise Point Positioning (PPP), an accurate GNSS operation mode independent of base stations, gains more popularity in unmanned systems. Considering the features of the two technologies, LiDAR-SLAM and PPP, this paper proposes a SLAM system, namely P3-LOAM (PPP based LiDAR Odometry and Mapping) which couples LiDAR-SLAM and PPP. For better integration, we derive LiDAR-SLAM positioning covariance by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Jacobian model, since SVD provides an explicit analytic solution of Iterative Closest Point (ICP), which is a key issue in LiDAR-SLAM. A novel method is then proposed to evaluate the estimated LiDAR-SLAM covariance. In addition, to increase the reliability of GNSS in urban canyon environment, we develop a LiDAR-SLAM assisted GNSS Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) algorithm. Finally, we validate P$^3$-LOAM with UrbanNav, a challenging public dataset in urban canyon environment. Comprehensive test results prove that P3-LOAM outperforms benchmarks such as Single Point Positioning (SPP), PPP, LeGO-LOAM, SPP-LOAM, and loosely coupled navigation system proposed by the publisher of UrbanNav in terms of accuracy and availability.</p></details> |  |

This paper provides an overview of Monitoring ICAROUS, a project whose objective is to provide a formal approach to generating runtime monitors for autonomous systems from requirements written in a structured natural language. This approach integrates FRET, a formal requirement elicitation and authoring tool, and Copilot, a runtime verification framework. FRET is used to specify formal requirements in structured natural language. These requirements are translated into temporal logic formulae. Copilot is then used to generate executable runtime monitors from these temporal logic specifications. The generated monitors are directly integrated into ICAROUS to perform runtime verification during flight.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings FMAS 2020, arXiv:2012.01176</p></details> |
| **[Long-distance tiny face detection based on enhanced YOLOv3 for unmanned system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04421v1)** | 2020-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote tiny face detection applied in unmanned system is a challeng-ing work. The detector cannot obtain sufficient context semantic information due to the relatively long distance. The received poor fine-grained features make the face detection less accurate and robust. To solve the problem of long-distance detection of tiny faces, we propose an enhanced network model (YOLOv3-C) based on the YOLOv3 algorithm for unmanned platform. In this model, we bring in multi-scale features from feature pyramid networks and make the features fu-sion to adjust prediction feature map of the output, which improves the sensitivity of the entire algorithm for tiny target faces. The enhanced model improves the accuracy of tiny face detection in the cases of long-distance and high-density crowds. The experimental evaluation results demonstrated the superior perfor-mance of the proposed YOLOv3-C in comparison with other relevant detectors in remote tiny face detection. It is worth mentioning that our proposed method achieves comparable performance with the state of the art YOLOv4[1] in the tiny face detection tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion Planning for Heterogeneous Unmanned Systems under Partial Observation from UAV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09633v2)** | 2020-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For heterogeneous unmanned systems composed of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), using UAVs serve as eyes to assist UGVs in motion planning is a promising research direction due to the UAVs' vast view scope. However, due to UAVs flight altitude limitations, it may be impossible to observe the global map, and motion planning in the local map is a POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) problem. This paper proposes a motion planning algorithm for heterogeneous unmanned system under partial observation from UAV without reconstruction of global maps, which consists of two parts designed for perception and decision-making, respectively. For the perception part, we propose the Grid Map Generation Network (GMGN), which is used to perceive scenes from UAV's perspective and classify the pathways and obstacles. For the decision-making part, we propose the Motion Command Generation Network (MCGN). Due to the addition of memory mechanism, MCGN has planning and reasoning abilities under partial observation from UAVs. We evaluate our proposed algorithm by comparing with baseline algorithms. The results show that our method effectively plans the motion of heterogeneous unmanned systems and achieves a relatively high success rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Cooperative Robotics and Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12230v1)** | 2020-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intersection of Quantum Technologies and Robotics Autonomy is explored in the present paper. The two areas are brought together in establishing an interdisciplinary interface that contributes to advancing the field of system autonomy, and pushes the engineering boundaries beyond the existing techniques. The present research adopts the experimental aspects of quantum entanglement and quantum cryptography, and integrates these established quantum capabilities into distributed robotic platforms, to explore the possibility of achieving increased autonomy for the control of multi-agent robotic systems engaged in cooperative tasks. Experimental quantum capabilities are realized by producing single photons (using spontaneous parametric down-conversion process), polarization of photons, detecting vertical and horizontal polarizations, and single photon detecting/counting. Specifically, such quantum aspects are implemented on network of classical agents, i.e., classical aerial and ground robots/unmanned systems. With respect to classical systems for robotic applications, leveraging quantum technology is expected to lead to guaranteed security, very fast control and communication, and unparalleled quantum capabilities such as entanglement and quantum superposition that will enable novel applications.</p></details> | 18 pages, 21 figures |

There has been tremendous growth in different applications of UAVs such as lifesaving and rescue missions, commercial use, recreations, etc. Unlike the traditional wireless communications, the data links for these systems do not have any general standardized framework yet to ensure safe co-existence of UAVs with other flying vehicles. This motivated us to provide a comprehensive survey of potential data link technologies available for UAVs. Our goal is to study the current trends and available candidates and carry out a comprehensive comparison among them. The contribution of this survey is to highlight the strength and weakness of the current data link options and their suitability to satisfy the UAVs communication requirements. Satellite links, cellular technologies, Wi-Fi and several similar wireless technologies are studied thoroughly in this paper. We also focus on several available promising standards that can be modified for these data links. Then, we discuss standard-related organizations that are working actively in the area of civilian unmanned systems. Finally, we bring up some future challenges in this area with several potential solutions to motivate further research work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Collision Probability Estimation Based on Finite-Dimensional Monte Carlo Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03973v1)** | 2020-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety concern for unmanned systems, namely the concern for the potential casualty caused by system abnormalities, has been a bottleneck for their development, especially in populated areas. Evidently, the collision between the unmanned system and the obstacles, including both moving and static objects, accounts for a great proportion of the system abnormalities. The route planning and corresponding controller are established in order to avoid the collision, whereas, in the presence of uncertainties, it is possible that the unmanned system would deviate from the predetermined route and collide with the obstacles. Therefore, for the safety of unmanned systems, collision probability estimation and further safety decision are very important. To estimate the collision probability, the Monte Carlo method could be applied, however, it is generally rather slow. This paper introduces a fast collision probability estimation method based on finite-dimensional distribution, whose main idea is to filter out the sampling points needed and generate the states directly by samples of finite-dimensional distribution, reducing the estimation time significantly. Besides, further techniques including the probabilistic equidistance sampling and dimension reduction, also serve to reduce the estimation time. The simulation shows that the proposed method reduces over 99% of the estimation time.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |

It specifies a comprehensive set of messages exchanged between unmanned systems and ground stations. This protocol is used in major autopilot systems, mainly ArduPilot and PX4, and provides powerful features not only for monitoring and controlling unmanned systems missions but also for their integration into the Internet. However, there is no technical survey and/or tutorial in the literature that presents these features or explains how to make use of them. Most of the references are online tutorials and basic technical reports, and none of them presents comprehensive and systematic coverage of the protocol. In this paper, we address this gap, and we propose an overview of the MAVLink protocol, the difference between its versions, and its potential in enabling Internet connectivity to unmanned systems. We also discuss the security aspects of MAVLink. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first technical survey and tutorial on the MAVLink protocol, which represents an important reference for unmanned systems users and developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Access, June 2019</p></details> |
| **[Fast Online Exact Solutions for Deterministic MDPs with Sparse Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02785v3)** | 2018-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are a mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision making under uncertainty. The classical approaches for solving MDPs are well known and have been widely studied, some of which rely on approximation techniques to solve MDPs with large state space and/or action space. However, most of these classical solution approaches and their approximation techniques still take much computation time to converge and usually must be re-computed if the reward function is changed. This paper introduces a novel alternative approach for exactly and efficiently solving deterministic, continuous MDPs with sparse reward sources. When the environment is such that the "distance" between states can be determined in constant time, e.g. grid world, our algorithm offers $O( |R|^2 \times |A|^2 \times |S|)$, where $|R|$ is the number of reward sources, $|A|$ is the number of actions, and $|S|$ is the number of states. Memory complexity for the algorithm is $O( |S| + |R| \times |A|)$. This new approach opens new avenues for boosting computational performance for certain classes of MDPs and is of tremendous value for MDP applications such as robotics and unmanned systems. This paper describes the algorithm and presents numerical experiment results to demonstrate its powerful computational performance. We also provide rigorous mathematical description of the approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NIPS 2018; preprint version posted here. 8 pages content, appendices include pseudocode and proof for algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Objective Cooperative Search of Spatially Diverse Routes in Uncertain Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04881v1)** | 2017-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on developing new navigation and reconnaissance capabilities for cooperative unmanned systems in uncertain environments. The goal is to design a cooperative multi-vehicle system that can survey an unknown environment and find the most valuable route for personnel to travel. To accomplish the goal, the multi-vehicle system first explores spatially diverse routes and then selects the safest route. In particular, the proposed cooperative path planner sequentially generates a set of spatially diverse routes according to a number of factors, including travel distance, ease of travel, and uncertainty associated with the ease of travel. The planner's dependence on each of these factors is altered by a weighted score, doing so changes the criteria for determining an optimum route. To penalize the selection of same paths by different vehicles, a control gain is used to increase the cost of paths that lie near the route(s) assigned to other vehicles. By varying the control gain, the spatial diversity among routes can be accomplished. By repeatedly searching for different paths cooperatively, an optimal path can be selected that yields the most valuable route.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to a conference</p></details> |

Target localization plays a crucial role in numerous applications, such as search, and rescue missions, traffic management and surveillance. The objective of this paper is to present an innovative target location learning approach, where numerous machine learning approaches, including K-means clustering and supported vector machines (SVM), are used to learn the data pattern across a list of spatially distributed sensors. To enable the accurate data association from different sensors for accurate target localization, appropriate data pre-processing is essential, which is then followed by the application of different machine learning algorithms to appropriately group data from different sensors for the accurate localization of multiple targets. Through simulation examples, the performance of these machine learning algorithms is quantified and compared.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted for conference publication</p></details> |
