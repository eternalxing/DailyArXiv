| **[Agentic Design of Compositional Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14980v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>75 pa...</summary><p>75 pages, 31 figures, Project Page: https://besiegefield.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Information Gain-based Policy Optimization: A Simple and Effective Approach for Multi-Turn LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14967v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues: (i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios, achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[CBF-RL: Safety Filtering Reinforcement Learning in Training with Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14959v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally deployed \emph{online} via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior, the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically, we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards -- enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without a runtime safety filter.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Edge devices are limited in computing power and memory, making model efficiency and compression essential. In this work, we propose EdgeNavMamba, a reinforcement learning-based framework for goal-directed navigation using an efficient Mamba object detection model. To train and evaluate the detector, we introduce a custom shape detection dataset collected in diverse indoor settings, reflecting visual cues common in real-world navigation. The object detector serves as a pre-processing module, extracting bounding boxes (BBOX) from visual input, which are then passed to an RL policy to control goal-oriented navigation. Experimental results show that the student model achieved a reduction of 67% in size, and up to 73% in energy per inference on edge devices of NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi 5, while keeping the same performance as the teacher model. EdgeNavMamba also maintains high detection accuracy in MiniWorld and IsaacLab simulators while reducing parameters by 31% compared to the baseline. In the MiniWorld simulator, the navigation policy achieves over 90% success across environments of varying complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 11th IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing and Scalable Cloud (IEEE EdgeCom 2025)</p></details> |
| **[LaSeR: Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token Self-Rewarding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14943v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score, which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time scaling performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

| **[VT-Refine: Learning Bimanual Assembly with Visuo-Tactile Feedback via Simulation Fine-Tunin](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14930v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans excel at bimanual assembly tasks by adapting to rich tactile feedback -- a capability that remains difficult to replicate in robots through behavioral cloning alone, due to the suboptimality and limited diversity of human demonstrations. In this work, we present VT-Refine, a visuo-tactile policy learning framework that combines real-world demonstrations, high-fidelity tactile simulation, and reinforcement learning to tackle precise, contact-rich bimanual assembly. We begin by training a diffusion policy on a small set of demonstrations using synchronized visual and tactile inputs. This policy is then transferred to a simulated digital twin equipped with simulated tactile sensors and further refined via large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance robustness and generalization. To enable accurate sim-to-real transfer, we leverage high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors that provide normal force signals and can be realistically modeled in parallel using GPU-accelerated simulation. Experimental results show that VT-Refine improves assembly performance in both simulation and the real world by increasing data diversity and enabling more effective policy fine-tuning.

| **[Beyond Two-Stage Training: Cooperative SFT and RL for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06948v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this decoupled two-stage approach suffers from catastrophic forgetting: second-stage RL gradually loses SFT-acquired behaviors and inefficiently explores new patterns. This study introduces a novel method for learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hard-Label Black-Box Evasion Attack against ML-based Malicious Traffic Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14906v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning (ML)-based malicious traffic detection is a promising security paradigm. It outperforms rule-based traditional detection by identifying various advanced attacks. However, the robustness of these ML models is largely unexplored, thereby allowing attackers to craft adversarial traffic examples that evade detection. Existing evasion attacks typically rely on overly restrictive conditions (e.g., encrypted protocols, Tor, or specialized setups), or require detailed prior knowledge of the target (e.g., training data and model parameters), which is impractical in realistic black-box scenarios. The feasibility of a hard-label black-box evasion attack (i.e., applicable across diverse tasks and protocols without internal target insights) thus remains an open challenge. To this end, we develop NetMasquerade, which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to manipulate attack flows to mimic benign traffic and evade detection. Specifically, we establish a tailored pre-trained model called Traffic-BERT, utilizing a network-specialized tokenizer and an attention mechanism to extract diverse benign traffic patterns. Subsequently, we integrate Traffic-BERT into the RL framework, allowing NetMasquerade to effectively manipulate malicious packet sequences based on benign traffic patterns with minimal modifications. Experimental results demonstrate that NetMasquerade enables both brute-force and stealthy attacks to evade 6 existing detection methods under 80 attack scenarios, achieving over 96.65% attack success rate. Notably, it can evade the methods that are either empirically or certifiably robust against existing evasion attacks. Finally, NetMasquerade achieves low-latency adversarial traffic generation, demonstrating its practicality in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning with Sampling: Your Base Model is Smarter Than You Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14901v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models. In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining. Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mapping Smarter, Not Harder: A Test-Time Reinforcement Learning Agent That Improves Without Labels or Model Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14900v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However, vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced, mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent: 1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\% over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient, flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategyproof Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09561v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in settings where multiple labelers may strategically misreport feedback to steer the learned policy toward their own preferences. We show that existing RLHF algorithms, including recent pluralistic methods, are not strategyproof, and that even a single strategic labeler can cause arbitrarily large misalignment with social welfare. Moreover, we prove that, in the worst case, any strategyproof RLHF algorithm must perform $k$-times worse than the optimal policy, where $k$ is the number of labelers. This suggests a fundamental trade-off between incentive alignment (ensuring labelers report truthfully) and policy alignment (maximizing social welfare). To address this, we propose the Pessimistic Median of MLEs algorithm, which, under appropriate policy coverage assumptions, is approximately strategyproof and converges to the optimal policy as the number of labelers and samples increases. Our results apply to both contextual bandits and Markov decision processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Thinker: Learning to Think Fast and Slow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21097v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be improved by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to question-answering (QA) tasks in areas such as math and coding. With a long context length, LLMs may learn to perform search, as indicated by the self-correction behavior observed in DeepSeek R1. However, this search behavior is often imprecise and lacks confidence, resulting in long, redundant responses and highlighting deficiencies in intuition and verification. Inspired by the Dual Process Theory in psychology, we introduce a simple modification to the QA task that includes four stages: Fast Thinking, where the LLM must answer within a strict token budget; Verification, where the model evaluates its initial response; Slow Thinking, where it refines the initial response with more deliberation; and Summarization, where it distills the refinement from the previous stage into precise steps. Our proposed task improves average accuracy from 25.6% to 27.3% for Qwen2.5-1.5B, and from 45.9% to 51.0% for DeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B. Notably, for Qwen2.5-1.5B, the Fast Thinking mode alone achieves 25.2% accuracy using fewer than 1000 tokens, demonstrating substantial inference efficiency gains. These findings suggest that intuition and deliberative reasoning are distinct, complementary systems benefiting from targeted training. Additionally, we have open-sourced both the trained models and the source code.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[Reinforcement Learning with Stochastic Reward Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14837v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm, based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A shorter version of this paper appeared in the Proceedings of the Thirty-Sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-22).

| **[RL-100: Performant Robotic Manipulation with Real-World Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14830v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world robotic manipulation in homes and factories demands reliability, efficiency, and robustness that approach or surpass skilled human operators. We present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning training framework built on diffusion visuomotor policies trained bu supervised learning. RL-100 introduces a three-stage pipeline. First, imitation learning leverages human priors. Second, iterative offline reinforcement learning uses an Offline Policy Evaluation procedure, abbreviated OPE, to gate PPO-style updates that are applied in the denoising process for conservative and reliable improvement. Third, online reinforcement learning eliminates residual failure modes. An additional lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the multi-step sampling process in diffusion into a single-step policy, enabling high-frequency control with an order-of-magnitude reduction in latency while preserving task performance. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and representation-agnostic and supports both 3D point clouds and 2D RGB inputs, a variety of robot platforms, and both single-step and action-chunk policies. We evaluate RL-100 on seven real-robot tasks spanning dynamic rigid-body control, such as Push-T and Agile Bowling, fluids and granular pouring, deformable cloth folding, precise dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage orange juicing. RL-100 attains 100\% success across evaluated trials for a total of 900 out of 900 episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task. The method achieves near-human teleoperation or better time efficiency and demonstrates multi-hour robustness with uninterrupted operation lasting up to two hours.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://lei-kun.github.io/RL-100/</p></details> |
| **[RoboGPT-R1: Enhancing Robot Planning with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14828v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1, a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework, supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences, followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini, by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the EmbodiedBench benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimKO: Simple Pass@K Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14807v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1 candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way to improve RLVR's exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report (20 pages, 10 figures, project page: https://spherelab.ai/simko/)</p></details> |

While end-to-end vision-based methods promise broader applicability, no system to date simultaneously achieves full sim-to-real transfer, onboard execution, and champion-level performance. In this work, we present SkyDreamer, to the best of our knowledge, the first end-to-end vision-based ADR policy that maps directly from pixel-level representations to motor commands. SkyDreamer builds on informed Dreamer, a model-based reinforcement learning approach where the world model decodes to privileged information only available during training. By extending this concept to end-to-end vision-based ADR, the world model effectively functions as an implicit state and parameter estimator, greatly improving interpretability. SkyDreamer runs fully onboard without external aid, resolves visual ambiguities by tracking progress using the state decoded from the world model's hidden state, and requires no extrinsic camera calibration, enabling rapid deployment across different drones without retraining. Real-world experiments show that SkyDreamer achieves robust, high-speed flight, executing tight maneuvers such as an inverted loop, a split-S and a ladder, reaching speeds of up to 21 m/s and accelerations of up to 6 g. It further demonstrates a non-trivial visual sim-to-real transfer by operating on poor-quality segmentation masks, and exhibits robustness to battery depletion by accurately estimating the maximum attainable motor RPM and adjusting its flight path in real-time. These results highlight SkyDreamer's adaptability to important aspects of the reality gap, bringing robustness while still achieving extremely high-speed, agile flight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Neural Descriptor Fields for Learning Contact-Aware Dynamic Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14768v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world dexterous manipulation often encounters unexpected errors and disturbances, which can lead to catastrophic failures, such as dropping the manipulated object. To address this challenge, we focus on the problem of catching a falling object while it remains within grasping range and, importantly, resetting the system to a configuration favorable for resuming the primary manipulation task. We propose Contact-Aware Dynamic Recovery (CADRE), a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a Neural Descriptor Field (NDF)-inspired module to extract implicit contact features. Compared to methods that rely solely on object pose or point cloud input, NDFs can directly reason about finger-object correspondence and adapt to different object geometries. Our experiments show that incorporating contact features improves training efficiency, enhances convergence performance for RL training, and ultimately leads to more successful recoveries. Additionally, we demonstrate that CADRE can generalize zero-shot to unseen objects with different geometries.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Cognitive-Aligned Spatio-Temporal Large Language Models For Next Point-of-Interest Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14702v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems, which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays, and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns, profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of 2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in "Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of CoAST.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning via Inverse Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20030v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the recent successes of Inverse Optimization (IO) across various application domains, we propose a novel offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) algorithm for continuous state and action spaces, leveraging the convex loss function called ``sub-optimality loss" from the IO literature. To mitigate the distribution shift commonly observed in ORL problems, we further employ a robust and non-causal Model Predictive Control (MPC) expert steering a nominal model of the dynamics using in-hindsight information stemming from the model mismatch. Unlike the existing literature, our robust MPC expert enjoys an exact and tractable convex reformulation. In the second part of this study, we show that the IO hypothesis class, trained by the proposed convex loss function, enjoys ample expressiveness and achieves competitive performance comparing with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the low-data regime of the MuJoCo benchmark while utilizing three orders of magnitude fewer parameters, thereby requiring significantly fewer computational resources. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we provide an open-source package implementing the proposed algorithms and the experiments.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[On the Generalization of SFT: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective with Reward Rectification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05629v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization.

Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast, generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads. Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a 4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust, and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Bidding Games: Reinforcement Learning for MEV Extraction on Polygon Blockchain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14642v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In blockchain networks, the strategic ordering of transactions within blocks has emerged as a significant source of profit extraction, known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). The transition from spam-based Priority Gas Auctions to structured auction mechanisms like Polygon Atlas has transformed MEV extraction from public bidding wars into sealed-bid competitions under extreme time constraints. While this shift reduces network congestion, it introduces complex strategic challenges where searchers must make optimal bidding decisions within a sub-second window without knowledge of competitor behavior or presence. Traditional game-theoretic approaches struggle in this high-frequency, partially observable environment due to their reliance on complete information and static equilibrium assumptions. We present a reinforcement learning framework for MEV extraction on Polygon Atlas and make three contributions: (1) A novel simulation environment that accurately models the stochastic arrival of arbitrage opportunities and probabilistic competition in Atlas auctions; (2) A PPO-based bidding agent optimized for real-time constraints, capable of adaptive strategy formulation in continuous action spaces while maintaining production-ready inference speeds; (3) Empirical validation demonstrating our history-conditioned agent captures 49\% of available profits when deployed alongside existing searchers and 81\% when replacing the market leader, significantly outperforming static bidding strategies. Our work establishes that reinforcement learning provides a critical advantage in high-frequency MEV environments where traditional optimization methods fail, offering immediate value for industrial participants and protocol designers alike.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATGen: Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Test Case Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14635v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, yet their outputs often contain subtle bugs, for which effective test cases are a critical bottleneck. Existing test generation methods, whether based on prompting or supervised fine-tuning, rely on static datasets. This imposes a ``fixed-difficulty ceiling'', fundamentally limiting their ability to uncover novel or more complex bugs beyond their training scope. To overcome this, we introduce ATGen, a framework that trains a test case generator via adversarial reinforcement learning. ATGen pits a test generator against an adversarial code generator that continuously crafts harder bugs to evade the current policy. This dynamic loop creates a curriculum of increasing difficulty challenging current policy. The test generator is optimized via Reinforcement Learning (RL) to jointly maximize ``Output Accuracy'' and ``Attack Success'', enabling it to learn a progressively stronger policy that breaks the fixed-difficulty ceiling of static training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ATGen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We further validate its practical utility, showing it serves as both a more effective filter for Best-of-N inference and a higher-quality reward source for training code generation models. Our work establishes a new, dynamic paradigm for improving the reliability of LLM-generated code.</p></details> |  |
| **[MR.Rec: Synergizing Memory and Reasoning for Personalized Recommendation Assistant with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14629v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems faces key challenges in delivering deep personalization and intelligent reasoning, especially for interactive scenarios. Current methods are often constrained by limited context windows and single-turn reasoning, hindering their ability to capture dynamic user preferences and proactively reason over recommendation contexts. To address these limitations, we propose MR.Rec, a novel framework that synergizes memory and reasoning for LLM-based recommendations. To achieve personalization, we develop a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that efficiently indexes and retrieves relevant external memory to enhance LLM personalization capabilities. Furthermore, to enable the synergy between memory and reasoning, our RAG system goes beyond conventional query-based retrieval by integrating reasoning enhanced memory retrieval. Finally, we design a reinforcement learning framework that trains the LLM to autonomously learn effective strategies for both memory utilization and reasoning refinement. By combining dynamic memory retrieval with adaptive reasoning, this approach ensures more accurate, context-aware, and highly personalized recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR.Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics, validating its efficacy in delivering intelligent and personalized recommendations. We will release code and data upon paper notification.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLAIF-SPA: Optimizing LLM-based Emotional Speech Synthesis via RLAIF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14628v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech, but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech, leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization. Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code-driven Number Sequence Calculation: Enhancing the inductive Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14620v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks. Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections, thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking. Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation, enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures. Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-based Visual Question Answer with Multimodal Processing, Retrieval and Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14605v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

However, both offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed $\textbf{RPEX}$: $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{EX}$pansion. Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios.

| **[Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14545v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues; and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14 challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating scalable web agent training.</p></details> | Working in progress |
| **[Learning to Undo: Rollback-Augmented Reinforcement Learning with Reversibility Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14503v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a reversible learning framework to improve the robustness and efficiency of value based Reinforcement Learning agents, addressing vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible environments. The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an empirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and a selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action estimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior state within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term during temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility awareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a selective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly lower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined threshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather than progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids catastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted rollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the CliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8 percent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi v3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9 percent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while also sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies confirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these safety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable sequential decision making.</p></details> | Submitted PLOS ONE |
| **[A Hybrid Machine Learning Approach for Synthetic Data Generation with Post Hoc Calibration for Clinical Tabular Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10513v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare research and development face significant obstacles due to data scarcity and stringent privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR, restricting access to essential real-world medical data. These limitations impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics while safeguarding patient privacy. We introduce a novel hybrid framework for high-fidelity healthcare data synthesis integrating five augmentation methods: noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) sampling, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around 0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%, confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable to models trained on real data. This scalable, privacy-preserving approach matches state-of-the-art methods, sets new benchmarks for joint-distribution fidelity in healthcare, and supports sensitive AI applications.</p></details> |  |

By decoupling tool selection from response generation, NLT eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4 percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.</p></details> | 31 pages, 7 figures |

Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn instruction following.

Recent RLVR works that operate under the zero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still depend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training. The scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the long-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already evident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a hypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by humans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To address these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in which a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any external data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability by using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and verify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide open-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without external data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens of thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is compatible with various model classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rediscovering Entropy Regularization: Adaptive Coefficient Unlocks Its Potential for LLM Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10959v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

While recent benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75%) and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hi-Agent: Hierarchical Vision-Language Agents for Mobile Device Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14388v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark, significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based (AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones, showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEPO: Group Expectation Policy Optimization for Stable Heterogeneous Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17850v7)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized training becomes essential. However, traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, crucial for enhancing large model post-training, cannot adapt to decentralized distributed training due to the tight coupling between parameter learning and rollout sampling. For this, we propose HeteroRL, a heterogeneous RL architecture that decouples these processes, enabling stable training across geographically distributed nodes connected via the Internet. The core component is Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO), an asynchronous RL algorithm robust to latency caused by network delays or heterogeneity in computational resources. Our study reveals that high latency significantly increases KL divergence, leading to higher variance of importance weights and training instability. GEPO mitigates this issue by using group expectation weighting to exponentially reduce the variance of importance weights, with theoretical guarantees. Experiments show GEPO achieves superior stability - only a 3% performance drop from online to 1800s latency-and reduces the best-to-last gap by 85% versus GSPO (1.8 vs. 12.0) while attaining the highest scores, highlighting its effectiveness in decentralized, resource-heterogeneous environments.</p></details> |  |

Our approach trains a family of risk-conditioned policies using a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constrained policy optimization technique that provides improved stability and sample efficiency. At deployment, we adaptively select the best performing policy from the family of policies using a multi-armed bandit framework that uses only observed episodic returns, without any privileged environment information, and adapts to unknown conditions on the fly. Hence, we train quadrupedal locomotion policies at various levels of robustness using CVaR and adaptively select the desired level of robustness online to ensure performance in unknown environments. We evaluate our method in simulation across eight unseen settings (by changing dynamics, contacts, sensing noise, and terrain) and on a Unitree Go2 robot in previously unseen terrains. Our risk-aware policy attains nearly twice the mean and tail performance in unseen environments compared to other baselines and our bandit-based adaptation selects the best-performing risk-aware policy in unknown terrain within two minutes of operation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Reasoning Embedding Models: Towards Next-Generation Dense Retrieval Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14321v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern e-commerce search systems, dense retrieval has become an indispensable component. By computing similarities between query and item (product) embeddings, it efficiently selects candidate products from large-scale repositories. With the breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs), mainstream embedding models have gradually shifted from BERT to LLMs for more accurate text modeling. However, these models still adopt direct-embedding methods, and the semantic accuracy of embeddings remains inadequate. Therefore, contrastive learning is heavily employed to achieve tight semantic alignment between positive pairs. Consequently, such models tend to capture statistical co-occurrence patterns in the training data, biasing them toward shallow lexical and semantic matches. For difficult queries exhibiting notable lexical disparity from target items, the performance degrades significantly. In this work, we propose the Large Reasoning Embedding Model (LREM), which novelly integrates reasoning processes into representation learning. For difficult queries, LREM first conducts reasoning to achieve a deep understanding of the original query, and then produces a reasoning-augmented query embedding for retrieval. This reasoning process effectively bridges the semantic gap between original queries and target items, significantly improving retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training process: the first stage optimizes the LLM on carefully curated Query-CoT-Item triplets with SFT and InfoNCE losses to establish preliminary reasoning and embedding capabilities, and the second stage further refines the reasoning trajectories via reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive offline and online experiments validate the effectiveness of LREM, leading to its deployment on China's largest e-commerce platform since August 2025.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating & Reducing Deceptive Dialogue From Language Models with Multi-turn RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14318v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently, poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior, combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation, and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly, models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average. Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Measuring in Reinforcement Learning With Delayed Negative Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14315v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state. The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.</p></details> |  |
| **[R1-Ranker: Teaching LLM Rankers to Reason](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21638v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning abilities in domains like mathematics, coding, and scientific problem-solving, yet their potential for ranking tasks, where prime examples include retrieval, recommender systems, and LLM routing, remains underexplored. Ranking requires complex reasoning across heterogeneous candidates, but existing LLM-based rankers are often domain-specific, tied to fixed backbones, and lack iterative refinement, limiting their ability to fully exploit LLMs' reasoning potential. To address these challenges, we propose R1-Ranker, a reasoning-incentive framework built on reinforcement learning, with two complementary designs: DRanker, which generates full rankings in one shot, and IRanker, which decomposes ranking into an iterative elimination process with step-wise rewards to encourage deeper reasoning. We evaluate unified R1-Rankers on nine datasets spanning recommendation, routing, and passage ranking, showing that IRanker-3B consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses larger 7B models on some tasks, and yields a 15.7% average relative improvement. Ablation and generalization experiments further confirm the critical role of reinforcement learning and iterative reasoning, with IRanker-3B improving zero-shot performance by over 9% on out-of-domain tasks and reasoning traces boosting other LLMs by up to 22.87%. These results demonstrate that unifying diverse ranking tasks with a single reasoning-driven foundation model is both effective and essential for advancing LLM reasoning in ranking scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While compliant robot-human collaboration has been extensively developed for robotic arms, enabling compliant human-humanoid collaboration remains largely unexplored due to humanoids' complex whole-body dynamics. In this paper, we propose a proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach, COLA, that combines leader and follower behaviors within a single policy. The model is trained in a closed-loop environment with dynamic object interactions to predict object motion patterns and human intentions implicitly, enabling compliant collaboration to maintain load balance through coordinated trajectory planning. We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulator and real-world experiments on collaborative carrying tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness, generalization, and robustness of our model across various terrains and objects. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our model reduces human effort by 24.7%. compared to baseline approaches while maintaining object stability. Real-world experiments validate robust collaborative carrying across different object types (boxes, desks, stretchers, etc.) and movement patterns (straight-line, turning, slope climbing). Human user studies with 23 participants confirm an average improvement of 27.4% compared to baseline models. Our method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying without requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

Prominent multi-agent frameworks often suffer from inefficiency, produce inconsistent signals, and lack the end-to-end optimization required to learn a coherent strategy from market feedback.

To address this, we propose Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identity-Preserving Image-to-Video Generation via Reward-Guided Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14255v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

| **[Towards Agentic Self-Learning LLMs in Search Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14253v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator, a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically, ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines (e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling. This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents.

Existing approaches integrate perception via Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or adaptive decision-making through Reinforcement Learning (RL), but they fail to capture dynamic object interactions or require task-specific training, limiting their real-world applicability. We introduce APEX (Anticipatory Physics-Enhanced Execution), a framework that equips LLMs with physics-driven foresight for real-time task planning. APEX constructs structured graphs to identify and model the most relevant dynamic interactions in the environment, providing LLMs with explicit physical state updates. Simultaneously, APEX provides low-latency forward simulations of physically feasible actions, allowing LLMs to select optimal strategies based on predictive outcomes rather than static observations. We evaluate APEX on three benchmarks designed to assess perception, prediction, and decision-making: (1) Physics Reasoning Benchmark, testing causal inference and object motion prediction; (2) Tetris, evaluating whether physics-informed prediction enhances decision-making performance in long-horizon planning tasks; (3) Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance, assessing the immediate integration of perception and action feasibility analysis. APEX significantly outperforms standard LLMs and VLM-based models, demonstrating the necessity of explicit physics reasoning for bridging the gap between language-based intelligence and real-world task execution. The source code and experiment setup are publicly available at https://github.com/hwj20/APEX_EXP .</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Regularized Distributionally Robust Markov Decision Processes with Linear Function Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14246v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ. We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics. Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret. To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally, empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate the robustness of DR-RPO.</p></details> | 53 pages, 8 figures |

However, many approaches struggle with reliability in the target domain, an issue particularly critical in medical image segmentation, where accuracy and anatomical validity are essential. This challenge is further exacerbated in spatio-temporal data, where the lack of temporal consistency can significantly degrade segmentation quality, and particularly in echocardiography, where the presence of artifacts and noise can further hinder segmentation performance. To address these issues, we present RL4Seg3D, an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D + time echocardiography segmentation. RL4Seg3D integrates novel reward functions and a fusion scheme to enhance key landmark precision in its segmentations while processing full-sized input videos. By leveraging reinforcement learning for image segmentation, our approach improves accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while also providing, as a beneficial side effect, a robust uncertainty estimator, which can be used at test time to further enhance segmentation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on over 30,000 echocardiographic videos, showing that it outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques without the need for any labels on the target domain.

To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of spatial computing communications (SCC), a framework designed to meet the latency and energy demands of multi-user VR over distributed mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. SCC jointly represents the physical space, defined by users and base stations, and the virtual space, representing shared immersive environments, using a probabilistic model of user dynamics and resource requirements. The resource deployment task is then formulated as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem that simultaneously minimizes system latency and energy consumption across distributed MEC resources. To solve this problem, we propose MO-CMPO, a multi-objective consistency model with policy optimization that integrates supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by preference weights. Leveraging a sparse graph neural network (GNN), MO-CMPO efficiently generates Pareto-optimal solutions. Simulations with real-world New Radio base station datasets demonstrate that MO-CMPO achieves superior hypervolume performance and significantly lower inference latency than baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis reveals practical deployment patterns: latency-oriented solutions favor local MEC execution to reduce transmission delay, while energy-oriented solutions minimize redundant placements to save energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submited to IEEE journal</p></details> |

In this paper, we developed large language model (LLM)-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive S-surface controller for AUVs. Specifically, LLMs are introduced for the joint optimization of controller parameters and reward functions in RL training. Using multi-modal and structured explicit task feedback, LLMs enable joint adjustments, balance multiple objectives, and enhance task-oriented performance and adaptability. In the proposed controller, the RL policy focuses on upper-level tasks, outputting task-oriented high-level commands that the S-surface controller then converts into control signals, ensuring cancellation of nonlinear effects and unpredictable external disturbances in extreme sea conditions. Under extreme sea conditions involving complex terrain, waves, and currents, the proposed controller demonstrates superior performance and adaptability in high-level tasks such as underwater target tracking and data collection, outperforming traditional PID and SMC controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE/RSJ IROS 2025</p></details> |

Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. In this paper, we investigate the Soft Thinking capabilities of various LLMs through a systematic analysis of their internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the prevailing belief that Soft Thinking supports parallel exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs behave as single-threaded reasoners--they predominantly rely on the token with the highest probability in the soft input to predict the next step. This behavior induces a greedy feedback loop that suppresses alternative reasoning paths and undermines the benefits of transmitting richer information via Soft Tokens. To address this Greedy Pitfall, we propose Stochastic Soft Thinking, which introduces stochasticity to break free from this Greedy Pitfall. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness--particularly with the Gumbel-Softmax trick--can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks. We further demonstrate that Stochastic Soft Thinking exhibits stronger exploration potential compared to conventional COT. Our findings deepen the understanding of continuous reasoning and establish the foundation for future work on improving Soft Thinking with Reinforcement Learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, working in progress</p></details> |

However, practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore, the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure, vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, chapter for edited book (Federated Learning: Foundations and Applications)</p></details> |

SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision. Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.</p></details> |  |

However, the inference of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step sampling during flow policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two algorithm variants based on rectified flow policy and MeanFlow policy, respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo and visual DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy baselines while requiring orders of magnitude less computational cost during inference.</p></details> |  |

We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs). Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification -- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks; and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot generalization.</p></details> |  |

While guaranteeing DP generally requires explicitly injecting noise either to the algorithm itself or to its outputs, the intrinsic randomness of existing algorithms presents an opportunity to achieve DP ``for free''. In this work, we explore the role of regularization in achieving DP across three different decision-making problems: multi-armed bandits, linear contextual bandits, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in offline data settings. We show that adding KL-regularization to the learning objective (a common approach in optimization algorithms) makes the action sampled from the resulting stochastic policy itself differentially private. This offers a new route to privacy guarantees without additional noise injection, while also preserving the inherent advantage of regularization in enhancing performance.</p></details> |  |

We study Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL), a self-supervised algorithm capable of solving challenging long-horizon goal-reaching tasks without external rewards or curricula. We combine theoretical analysis of the algorithm's objective function with controlled experiments to understand what drives its exploration. We show that SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by its learned representations. These representations automatically modify the reward landscape to promote exploration before reaching the goal and exploitation thereafter. Our experiments also demonstrate that these exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank representations of the state space rather than from neural network function approximation. Our improved understanding enables us to adapt SGCRL to perform safety-aware exploration.</p></details> |  |

However, real tactile sensors often face hardware limitations such as high costs and fragility, and deployment challenges involving calibration and variations between different sensors, while vision-only policies struggle with satisfactory performance. Inspired by humans' ability to infer tactile states from vision, we propose ViTacGen, a novel robot manipulation framework designed for visual robotic pushing with vision-to-touch generation in reinforcement learning to eliminate the reliance on high-resolution real tactile sensors, enabling effective zero-shot deployment on visual-only robotic systems. Specifically, ViTacGen consists of an encoder-decoder vision-to-touch generation network that generates contact depth images, a standardized tactile representation, directly from visual image sequence, followed by a reinforcement learning policy that fuses visual-tactile data with contrastive learning based on visual and generated tactile observations. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in both simulation and real world experiments, demonstrating its superior performance and achieving a success rate of up to 86\%.</p></details> |  |

Existing AR video diffusion models are limited to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control, then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B parameters.

Coordinated building energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems. Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees, and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management. STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and maintains effectiveness across different building types.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimistic Reinforcement Learning-Based Skill Insertions for Task and Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14065v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task and motion planning (TAMP) for robotics manipulation necessitates long-horizon reasoning involving versatile actions and skills. While deterministic actions can be crafted by sampling or optimizing with certain constraints, planning actions with uncertainty, i.e., probabilistic actions, remains a challenge for TAMP. On the contrary, Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels in acquiring versatile, yet short-horizon, manipulation skills that are robust with uncertainties. In this letter, we design a method that integrates RL skills into TAMP pipelines. Besides the policy, a RL skill is defined with data-driven logical components that enable the skill to be deployed by symbolic planning. A plan refinement sub-routine is designed to further tackle the inevitable effect uncertainties. In the experiments, we compare our method with baseline hierarchical planning from both TAMP and RL fields and illustrate the strength of the method. The results show that by embedding RL skills, we extend the capability of TAMP to domains with probabilistic skills, and improve the planning efficiency compared to the previous methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Diffusion-Refined Planner with Reinforcement Learning Priors for Confined-Space Parking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14000v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for parking has increased the need for automated parking planning methods that can operate reliably in confined spaces. In restricted and complex environments, high-precision maneuvers are required to achieve a high success rate in planning, yet existing approaches often rely on explicit action modeling, which faces challenges when accurately modeling the optimal action distribution. In this paper, we propose DRIP, a diffusion-refined planner anchored in reinforcement learning (RL) prior action distribution, in which an RL-pretrained policy provides prior action distributions to regularize the diffusion training process. During the inference phase the denoising process refines these coarse priors into more precise action distributions. By steering the denoising trajectory through the reinforcement learning prior distribution during training, the diffusion model inherits a well-informed initialization, resulting in more accurate action modeling, a higher planning success rate, and reduced inference steps. We evaluate our approach across parking scenarios with varying degrees of spatial constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves planning performance in confined-space parking environments while maintaining strong generalization in common scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation, proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware video generation and broader applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sihuiji.github.io/PhysMaster-Page/</p></details> |

Existing approaches to combat this rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex, multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating. Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer, competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x. It also transfers significantly to diverse out-of-distribution ReasoningGym domains and long-context benchmarks, indicating broader generalization. Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1 therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon problems using only existing data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, 31 pages, 8 figures, long-horizon reasoning</p></details> |
| **[Breadcrumbs Reasoning: Memory-Efficient Reasoning with Compression Beacons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13797v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scalability of large language models for long-context reasoning is severely constrained by the linear growth of their Transformer key-value cache, which incurs significant memory and computational costs. We posit that as a model generates reasoning tokens, the informational value of past generated tokens diminishes, creating an opportunity for compression. In this work, we propose to periodically compress the generation KV cache with a learned, special-purpose token and evict compressed entries. We train the model to perform this compression via a modified joint distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Our training method minimizes overhead over the conventional RL process, as it leverages RL outputs for distillation. Empirically, our method achieves a superior memory-accuracy Pareto frontier compared to both the model without cache compression and training-free compression techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flattening Hierarchies with Policy Bootstrapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14975v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a promising approach for pretraining generalist policies on large datasets of reward-free trajectories, akin to the self-supervised objectives used to train foundation models for computer vision and natural language processing. However, scaling GCRL to longer horizons remains challenging due to the combination of sparse rewards and discounting, which obscures the comparative advantages of primitive actions with respect to distant goals. Hierarchical RL methods achieve strong empirical results on long-horizon goal-reaching tasks, but their reliance on modular, timescale-specific policies and subgoal generation introduces significant additional complexity and hinders scaling to high-dimensional goal spaces. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to train a flat (non-hierarchical) goal-conditioned policy by bootstrapping on subgoal-conditioned policies with advantage-weighted importance sampling. Our approach eliminates the need for a generative model over the (sub)goal space, which we find is key for scaling to high-dimensional control in large state spaces. We further show that existing hierarchical and bootstrapping-based approaches correspond to specific design choices within our derivation. Across a comprehensive suite of state- and pixel-based locomotion and manipulation benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses state-of-the-art offline GCRL algorithms and scales to complex, long-horizon tasks where prior approaches fail.

In order to improve the robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial attack, such as state observation attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Art of Scaling Reinforcement Learning Compute for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13786v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets, there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum, and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long achieved in pre-training.</p></details> | 28 pages, 20 figures |
| **[Egocentric Visual Navigation through Hippocampal Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09951v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential activation of place-tuned neurons in an animal during navigation is typically interpreted as reflecting the sequence of input from adjacent positions along the trajectory. More recent theories about such place cells suggest sequences arise from abstract cognitive objectives like planning. Here, we propose a mechanistic and parsimonious interpretation to complement these ideas: hippocampal sequences arise from intrinsic recurrent circuitry that propagates activity without readily available input, acting as a temporal memory buffer for extremely sparse inputs. We implement a minimal sequence generator inspired by neurobiology and pair it with an actor-critic learner for egocentric visual navigation. Our agent reliably solves a continuous maze without explicit geometric cues, with performance depending on the length of the recurrent sequence. Crucially, the model outperforms LSTM cores under sparse input conditions (16 channels, ~2.5% activity), but not under dense input, revealing a strong interaction between representational sparsity and memory architecture. In contrast to LSTM agents, hidden sequence units develop localized place fields, distance-dependent spatial kernels, and task-dependent remapping, while inputs orthogonalize and spatial information increases across layers. These phenomena align with neurobiological data and are causal to performance. Together, our results show that sparse input synergizes with sequence-generating dynamics, providing both a mechanistic account of place cell sequences in the mammalian hippocampus and a simple inductive bias for reinforcement learning based on sparse egocentric inputs in navigation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 21 figures.

| **[Asymptotically optimal reinforcement learning in Block Markov Decision Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13748v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces. Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but where transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent advances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this latent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to determine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now addressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages clustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed effectively speed up learning. Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first learns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an optimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm achieves a regret that is $O(\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible to clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the cardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\cdot)$ holds up to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior bound, $O(\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large. Moreover, we prove that no algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this same class of BMDPs. This establishes that, on this class, the algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality.</p></details> | 74 pages, 3 figures |
| **[From Refusal to Recovery: A Control-Theoretic Approach to Generative AI Guardrails](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13727v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem: harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii) proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simplicial Embeddings Improve Sample Efficiency in Actor-Critic Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13704v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization; unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in runtime speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning for Data Collection Scheduling in UAV-assisted Sensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14556v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being utilized in various private and commercial applications, e.g., traffic control, parcel delivery, and Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. Machine Learning (ML) methods used in UAV-Assisted Sensor Networks (UASNETs) and, especially, in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) face challenges such as complex and lengthy model training, gaps between simulation and reality, and low sampling efficiency, which conflict with the urgency of emergencies, such as SAR missions. In this paper, an In-Context Learning (ICL)-Data Collection Scheduling (ICLDC) system is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The UAV collects sensory data and transmits it to a Large Language Model (LLM), which creates a task description in natural language. From this description, the UAV receives a data collection schedule that must be executed. A verifier ensures safe UAV operations by evaluating the schedules generated by the LLM and overriding unsafe schedules based on predefined rules. The system continuously adapts by incorporating feedback into the task descriptions and using this for future decisions. This method is tested against jailbreaking attacks, where the task description is manipulated to undermine network performance, highlighting the vulnerability of LLMs to such attacks. The proposed ICLDC significantly reduces cumulative packet loss compared to both the DQN and Maximum Channel Gain baselines. ICLDC presents a promising direction for intelligent scheduling and control in UASNETs.</p></details> |  |

We identify two key obstacles to its mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward models overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of suitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level constraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we propose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant information to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that reward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent space, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution. Motivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that penalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape while maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying reward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online mitigation such as early stopping. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets confirm the generality of our findings, the effectiveness of InfoRM and IBL, and the reliability of MOP as a diagnostic tool-collectively advancing the state of RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 36 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.</p></details> | 34 pages, 25 figures |

| **[Extended Friction Models for the Physics Simulation of Servo Actuators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08650v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate physical simulation is crucial for the development and validation of control algorithms in robotic systems. Recent works in Reinforcement Learning (RL) take notably advantage of extensive simulations to produce efficient robot control. State-of-the-art servo actuator models generally fail at capturing the complex friction dynamics of these systems. This limits the transferability of simulated behaviors to real-world applications. In this work, we present extended friction models that allow to more accurately simulate servo actuator dynamics. We propose a comprehensive analysis of various friction models, present a method for identifying model parameters using recorded trajectories from a pendulum test bench, and demonstrate how these models can be integrated into physics engines. The proposed friction models are validated on four distinct servo actuators and tested on 2R manipulators, showing significant improvements in accuracy over the standard Coulomb-Viscous model. Our results highlight the importance of considering advanced friction effects in the simulation of servo actuators to enhance the realism and reliability of robotic simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Illuminates LLM Reasoning: The Preplan-and-Anchor Rhythm Enables Fine-Grained Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13554v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics: 1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Tandem Training for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13551v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents, with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.</p></details> |  |

A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}oordinating \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.</p></details> |  |

In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of $\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size. In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log (N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space $\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF. As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces a novel approach to enhance quadruped locomotion robustness by training the Unitree Go2 robot on an oscillating bridge - a 13.24-meter steel-and-concrete structure with a 2.0 Hz eigenfrequency designed to perturb locomotion. Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm in a MuJoCo simulation, we trained 15 distinct locomotion policies, combining five gaits (trot, pace, bound, free, default) with three training conditions: rigid bridge and two oscillating bridge setups with differing height regulation strategies (relative to bridge surface or ground). Domain randomization ensured zero-shot transfer to the real-world bridge. Our results demonstrate that policies trained on the oscillating bridge exhibit superior stability and adaptability compared to those trained on rigid surfaces. Our framework enables robust gait patterns even without prior bridge exposure. These findings highlight the potential of simulation-based RL to improve quadruped locomotion during dynamic ground perturbations, offering insights for designing robots capable of traversing vibrating environments.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing RL approaches are tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

In this paper, we show that transformers can be strong baselines for continuous control in online model-free RL. We investigate key design questions: how to condition inputs, share components between actor and critic, and slice sequential data for training. Our experiments reveal stable architectural and training strategies enabling competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks, and in both vector- and image-based settings.

This study introduces an offline-to-online framework that trains policies on clean data and then performs adversarial fine-tuning, where perturbations are injected into executed actions to induce compensatory behavior and improve resilience. A performance-aware curriculum further adjusts the perturbation probability during training via an exponential-moving-average signal, balancing robustness and stability throughout the learning process. Experiments on continuous-control locomotion tasks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently improves robustness over offline-only baselines and converges faster than training from scratch. Matching the fine-tuning and evaluation conditions yields the strongest robustness to action-space perturbations, while the adaptive curriculum strategy mitigates the degradation of nominal performance observed with the linear curriculum strategy. Overall, the results show that adversarial fine-tuning enables adaptive and robust control under uncertain environments, bridging the gap between offline efficiency and online adaptability.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

Recently, MARL models, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep Q-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging sequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance performance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in which agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action Decisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which agents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence of action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and predict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a Transformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the sequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL architecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next agent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss function to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential decision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed AOAD-MAT model outperforms existing MAT and other baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of adjusting the AOAD order in MARL.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is an extended version of the work accepted as a short paper at the 26th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Multi-Agent Systems (PRIMA 2025).

Leveraging the Duncan-Guttman matrix identity, the parameter update is obtained by factorizing a matrix which has the size of the mini-batch. This is particularly advantageous for large-scale machine learning problems where the dimension of the neural network parameter vector is several orders of magnitude larger than the batch size. Additionally, we show how improvements such as line search, adaptive regularization, and momentum can be seamlessly added to EGN to further accelerate the algorithm. Moreover, under mild assumptions, we prove that our algorithm converges in expectation to a stationary point of the objective. Finally, our numerical experiments demonstrate that EGN consistently exceeds, or at most matches the generalization performance of well-tuned SGD, Adam, GAF, SQN, and SGN optimizers across various supervised and reinforcement learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Neurocomputing (2025).

| **[Distributed MPC-based Coordination of Traffic Perimeter and Signal Control: A Lexicographic Optimization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04038v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a comprehensive strategy that integrates traffic perimeter control with traffic signal control to alleviate congestion in an urban traffic network (UTN). The strategy is formulated as a lexicographic multi-objective optimization problem, starting with the regulation of traffic inflows at boundary junctions to maximize the capacity while ensuring a smooth operation of the UTN. Following this, the signal timings at internal junctions are collaboratively optimized to enhance overall traffic conditions under the regulated inflows. The use of a model predictive control (MPC) approach ensures that the control solution adheres to safety and capacity constraints within the network. To address the computational complexity of the problem, the UTN is divided into subnetworks, each managed by a local agent. A distributed solution method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is employed, allowing each agent to determine its optimal control decisions using local information from its subnetwork and neighboring agents. Numerical simulations using VISSIM and MATLAB demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed traffic control strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[FuzzyLight: A Robust Two-Stage Fuzzy Approach for Traffic Signal Control Works in Real Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15820v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial in mitigating urban congestion and reducing emissions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several real-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor accuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data transmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions. (2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could be unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP) selection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on TSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting safety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust two-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing and RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It employs fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances the efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during training and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It works in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior performance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results indicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to expert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six real-world datasets with transmission noise.

| **[Reinforcement Learning Based Traffic Signal Design to Minimize Queue Lengths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21745v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial for reducing congestion, travel delays, pollution, and for ensuring road safety. Traditional approaches, such as fixed signal control and actuated control, often struggle to handle dynamic traffic patterns. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive TSC framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL), using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to minimize total queue lengths across all signal phases. The challenge of efficiently representing highly stochastic traffic conditions for an RL controller is addressed through multiple state representations, including an expanded state space, an autoencoder representation, and a K-Planes-inspired representation. The proposed algorithm has been implemented using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator and demonstrates superior performance over both traditional methods and other conventional RL-based approaches in reducing queue lengths. The best performing configuration achieves an approximately 29% reduction in average queue lengths compared to the traditional Webster method. Furthermore, comparative evaluation of alternative reward formulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed queue-based approach, showcasing the potential for scalable and adaptive urban traffic management.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Distribution Shift Problem in Transportation Networks using Reinforcement Learning and AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15291v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart transportation networks has increased significantly in the last few years. Among these ML and AI approaches, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to be a very promising approach by several authors. However, a problem with using Reinforcement Learning in Traffic Signal Control is the reliability of the trained RL agents due to the dynamically changing distribution of the input data with respect to the distribution of the data used for training. This presents a major challenge and a reliability problem for the trained network of AI agents and could have very undesirable and even detrimental consequences if a suitable solution is not found. Several researchers have tried to address this problem using different approaches. In particular, Meta Reinforcement Learning (Meta RL) promises to be an effective solution. In this paper, we evaluate and analyze a state-of-the-art Meta RL approach called MetaLight and show that, while under certain conditions MetaLight can indeed lead to reasonably good results, under some other conditions it might not perform well (with errors of up to 22%), suggesting that Meta RL schemes are often not robust enough and can even pose major reliability problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic Co-Simulation Framework Empowered by Infrastructure Camera Sensing and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03925v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic simulations are commonly used to optimize urban traffic flow, with reinforcement learning (RL) showing promising potential for automated traffic signal control, particularly in intelligent transportation systems involving connected automated vehicles. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is particularly effective for learning control strategies for traffic lights in a network using iterative simulations. However, existing methods often assume perfect vehicle detection, which overlooks real-world limitations related to infrastructure availability and sensor reliability. This study proposes a co-simulation framework integrating CARLA and SUMO, which combines high-fidelity 3D modeling with large-scale traffic flow simulation. Cameras mounted on traffic light poles within the CARLA environment use a YOLO-based computer vision system to detect and count vehicles, providing real-time traffic data as input for adaptive signal control in SUMO. MARL agents trained with four different reward structures leverage this visual feedback to optimize signal timings and improve network-wide traffic flow. Experiments in a multi-intersection test-bed demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MARL approach in enhancing traffic conditions using real-time camera based detection. The framework also evaluates the robustness of MARL under faulty or sparse sensing and compares the performance of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for vehicle detection. Results show that while better accuracy improves performance, MARL agents can still achieve significant improvements with imperfect detection, demonstrating scalability and adaptability for real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiLight: A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework with Global Adversarial Guidance for Large-Scale Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14391v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is essential for mitigating urban congestion, yet existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods face challenges in scaling to large networks while maintaining global coordination. Centralized RL suffers from scalability issues, while decentralized approaches often lack unified objectives, resulting in limited network-level efficiency. In this paper, we propose HiLight, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with global adversarial guidance for large-scale TSC. HiLight consists of a high-level Meta-Policy, which partitions the traffic network into subregions and generates sub-goals using a Transformer-LSTM architecture, and a low-level Sub-Policy, which controls individual intersections with global awareness. To improve the alignment between global planning and local execution, we introduce an adversarial training mechanism, where the Meta-Policy generates challenging yet informative sub-goals, and the Sub-Policy learns to surpass these targets, leading to more effective coordination. We evaluate HiLight across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and additionally construct a large-scale Manhattan network with diverse traffic conditions, including peak transitions, adverse weather, and holiday surges. Experimental results show that HiLight exhibits significant advantages in large-scale scenarios and remains competitive across standard benchmarks of varying sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvolveSignal: A Large Language Model Powered Coding Agent for Discovering Traffic Signal Control Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03335v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator) and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers. This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Traffic Signal Control with Predictable Cycle Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03118v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile, the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the best performance over all datasets against baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Goal-Conditioned Data Augmentation for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20519v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from pre-collected offline datasets, relaxing the need to interact directly with the environment. However, limited by the quality of offline datasets, it generally fails to learn well-qualified policies in suboptimal datasets. To address datasets with insufficient optimal demonstrations, we introduce Goal-cOnditioned Data Augmentation (GODA), a novel goal-conditioned diffusion-based method for augmenting samples with higher quality. Leveraging recent advancements in generative modelling, GODA incorporates a novel return-oriented goal condition with various selection mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a controllable scaling technique to provide enhanced return-based guidance during data sampling. GODA learns a comprehensive distribution representation of the original offline datasets while generating new data with selectively higher-return goals, thereby maximizing the utility of limited optimal demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a novel adaptive gated conditioning method for processing noisy inputs and conditions, enhancing the capture of goal-oriented guidance. We conduct experiments on the D4RL benchmark and real-world challenges, specifically traffic signal control (TSC) tasks, to demonstrate GODA's effectiveness in enhancing data quality and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art data augmentation methods across various offline RL algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Contextual MARL (cMARL) addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts. Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at https://github.com/DaRL-LibSignal/cMALC-D.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A shorter version has been accepted to the 2025 Conference on Information and Knowledge Management</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Intelligent Transportation Systems: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20315v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient, sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals, autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems. Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA, and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks. The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPLight+: A Genetic Programming Method for Learning Symmetric Traffic Signal Control Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16090v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency function representation can significantly improve the performance of the learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal control policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metering traffic flows for perimeter control through auction-based signalling using connected vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09678v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban traffic congestion remains a critical challenge in modern cities, with traffic signal control systems often struggling to manage congestion during peak travel times. Perimeter control of a Protected Network (PN) has emerged as a potential solution to reducing gridlock in urban networks. This paper proposes a novel auction-based mechanism for green time allocation at signalized intersections, for effective perimeter control application. Utilising a Sealed Bid, Second Price auction framework, our approach combines real-time traffic monitoring with market-inspired mechanisms to regulate vehicle inflows into PN areas. Unlike existing methods that focus primarily on gated links, our system allocates budgets to individual traffic movements, providing greater flexibility in managing multi-directional flows. We evaluate the proposed mechanism using a test case intersection with a single controlled inflow, comparing it against a volume-based fixed-time approach. The results demonstrate that our auction-based method controls flows into the PN with improved accuracy, outperforming the volume-based approach in terms of inflow regulation, queue management and delays. The framework can be applied in real time to any generic intersection, offering a scalable solution for urban traffic management. This work bridges the gap between perimeter control and market-based intersection auctions, providing a pathway for further research on adaptive traffic management systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combat Urban Congestion via Collaboration: Heterogeneous GNN-based MARL for Coordinated Platooning and Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10948v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a popular approach to develop signal control and vehicle platooning strategies either independently or in a hierarchical way. However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |

Deploying interpretable surrogates of uninterpretable policies enhances the safety and verifiability of MARL for real-world applications. However, if these surrogates are to interact directly with the environment within human supervisory frameworks, they must be both performant and computationally efficient. Prior work on interpretable MARL has either sacrificed performance for computational efficiency or computational efficiency for performance. To address this issue, we propose HYDRAVIPER, a decision tree-based interpretable MARL algorithm. HYDRAVIPER coordinates training between agents based on expected team performance, and adaptively allocates budgets for environment interaction to improve computational efficiency. Experiments on standard benchmark environments for multi-agent coordination and traffic signal control show that HYDRAVIPER matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods using a fraction of the runtime, and that it maintains a Pareto frontier of performance for different interaction budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 2 tables; 12 figures; accepted version, published at the 8th AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics and Society (AIES '25)</p></details> |

Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art, outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily, shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload.

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The relevant datasets and code are available at https://github.com/ShuhaoLii/RoadDiff.</p></details> |  |

Our single-agent policy is trained using real-world pedestrian and vehicle demand data derived from Wi-Fi logs and video analysis. The results demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional fixed-time signals, reducing average wait times per pedestrian and per vehicle by up to 67% and 52% respectively, while simultaneously decreasing total wait times for both groups by up to 67% and 53%.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers an adaptive method for TSC by responding to dynamic traffic patterns, with multi-agent RL (MARL) gaining traction as intersections naturally function as coordinated agents. However, due to shifts in environmental dynamics, implementing MARL-based TSC policies in the real world often leads to a significant performance drop, known as the sim-to-real gap. Grounded Action Transformation (GAT) has successfully mitigated this gap in single-agent RL for TSC, but real-world traffic networks, which involve numerous interacting intersections, are better suited to a MARL framework. In this work, we introduce JL-GAT, an application of GAT to MARL-based TSC that balances scalability with enhanced grounding capability by incorporating information from neighboring agents. JL-GAT adopts a decentralized approach to GAT, allowing for the scalability often required in real-world traffic networks while still capturing key interactions between agents. Comprehensive experiments on various road networks under simulated adverse weather conditions, along with ablation studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of JL-GAT.

However, the traditional methods rely on standard graph structures often fail to capture the intricate higher-order spatio-temporal correlations inherent in real-world traffic dynamics. Standard graphs cannot fully represent the spatial relationships within road networks, which limits the effectiveness of graph-based approaches. In contrast, directed hypergraphs provide more accurate representation of spatial information to model complex directed relationships among multiple nodes. In this paper, we propose DHLight, a novel multi-agent policy-based framework that synergistically integrates directed hypergraph learning module. This framework introduces a novel dynamic directed hypergraph construction mechanism, which captures complex and evolving spatio-temporal relationships among intersections in road networks. By leveraging the directed hypergraph relational structure, DHLight empowers agents to achieve adaptive decision-making in traffic signal control. The effectiveness of DHLight is validated against state-of-the-art baselines through extensive experiments in various network datasets.

| **[Chat2SPaT: A Large Language Model Based Tool for Automating Traffic Signal Control Plan Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05283v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT) results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS) software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan. Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300 plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers, serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/yuewangits/Chat2SPaT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Traffic Signal Control based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Case Study on a simulated real-world corridor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02189v4)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies that have formulated multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for adaptive traffic signal control have primarily used value-based RL methods. However, recent literature has shown that policy-based methods may perform better in partially observable environments. Additionally, RL methods remain largely untested for real-world normally signal timing plans because of the simplifying assumptions common in the literature. The current study attempts to address these gaps and formulates a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO) algorithm to implement adaptive and coordinated traffic control along an arterial corridor. The formulated MA-PPO has a centralized-critic architecture under a centralized training and decentralized execution framework. Agents are designed to allow selection and implementation of up to eight signal phases, as commonly implemented in field controllers. The formulated algorithm is tested on a simulated real-world seven intersection corridor. The speed of convergence for each agent was found to depend on the size of the action space, which depends on the number and sequence of signal phases. The performance of the formulated MA-PPO adaptive control algorithm is compared with the field implemented actuated-coordinated signal control (ASC), modeled using PTV-Vissim-MaxTime software in the loop simulation (SILs). The trained MA-PPO performed significantly better than the ASC for all movements. Compared to ASC the MA-PPO showed 2% and 24% improvements in travel time in the primary and secondary coordination directions, respectively. For cross streets movements MA-PPO also showed significant crossing time reductions. Volume sensitivity experiments revealed that the formulated MA-PPO demonstrated good stability, robustness, and adaptability to changes in traffic demand.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Traffic Signal Control via Genetic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17328v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The control of traffic signals is crucial for improving transportation efficiency. Recently, learning-based methods, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), garnered substantial success in the quest for more efficient traffic signal control strategies. However, the design of rewards in DRL highly demands domain knowledge to converge to an effective policy, and the final policy also presents difficulties in terms of explainability. In this work, a new learning-based method for signal control in complex intersections is proposed. In our approach, we design a concept of phase urgency for each signal phase. During signal transitions, the traffic light control strategy selects the next phase to be activated based on the phase urgency. We then proposed to represent the urgency function as an explainable tree structure. The urgency function can calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. Genetic programming is adopted to perform gradient-free optimization of the urgency function. We test our algorithm on multiple public traffic signal control datasets. The experimental results indicate that the tree-shaped urgency function evolved by genetic programming outperforms the baselines, including a state-of-the-art method in the transportation field and a well-known DRL-based method. Our code is available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustness of Reinforcement Learning-Based Traffic Signal Control under Incidents: A Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13836v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning-based traffic signal control (RL-TSC) has emerged as a promising approach for improving urban mobility. However, its robustness under real-world disruptions such as traffic incidents remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce T-REX, an open-source, SUMO-based simulation framework for training and evaluating RL-TSC methods under dynamic, incident scenarios. T-REX models realistic network-level performance considering drivers' probabilistic rerouting, speed adaptation, and contextual lane-changing, enabling the simulation of congestion propagation under incidents. To assess robustness, we propose a suite of metrics that extend beyond conventional traffic efficiency measures. Through extensive experiments across synthetic and real-world networks, we showcase T-REX for the evaluation of several state-of-the-art RL-TSC methods under multiple real-world deployment paradigms. Our findings show that while independent value-based and decentralized pressure-based methods offer fast convergence and generalization in stable traffic conditions and homogeneous networks, their performance degrades sharply under incident-driven distribution shifts. In contrast, hierarchical coordination methods tend to offer more stable and adaptable performance in large-scale, irregular networks, benefiting from their structured decision-making architecture. However, this comes with the trade-off of slower convergence and higher training complexity. These findings highlight the need for robustness-aware design and evaluation in RL-TSC research. T-REX contributes to this effort by providing an open, standardized and reproducible platform for benchmarking RL methods under dynamic and disruptive traffic scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Topology-Assisted Spatio-Temporal Pattern Disentangling for Scalable MARL in Large-scale Autonomous Traffic Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12453v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) have emerged as a promising solution towards ameliorating urban traffic congestion, with Traffic Signal Control (TSC) identified as a critical component. Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms have shown potential in optimizing TSC through real-time decision-making, their scalability and effectiveness often suffer from large-scale and complex environments. Typically, these limitations primarily stem from a fundamental mismatch between the exponential growth of the state space driven by the environmental heterogeneities and the limited modeling capacity of current solutions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel MARL framework that integrates Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), aiming to enhance the expressiveness of environmental representations and improve agent coordination. Furthermore, inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs), a topology-assisted spatial pattern disentangling (TSD)-enhanced MoE is proposed, which leverages topological signatures to decouple graph features for specialized processing, thus improving the model's ability to characterize dynamic and heterogeneous local observations. The TSD module is also integrated into the policy and value networks of the Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, further improving decision-making efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world traffic scenarios, together with comprehensive theoretical analysis, validate the superior performance of the proposed framework, highlighting the model's scalability and effectiveness in addressing the complexities of large-scale TSC tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLMLight: Traffic Signal Control via Vision-Language Meta-Control and Dual-Branch Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19486v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control (TSC) is a core challenge in urban mobility, where real-time decisions must balance efficiency and safety. Existing methods - ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type, motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems, while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1% degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware solution for next-generation traffic signal control.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |
| **[CV-MP: Max-Pressure Control in Heterogeneously Distributed and Partially Connected Vehicle Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05258v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Max-pressure (MP) control has emerged as a prominent real-time network traffic signal control strategy due to its simplicity, decentralized structure, and theoretical guarantees of network queue stability. Meanwhile, advances in connected vehicle (CV) technology have sparked extensive research into CV-based traffic signal control. Despite these developments, few studies have investigated MP control in heterogeneously distributed and partially CV environments while ensuring network queue stability. To address these research gaps, we propose a CV-based MP control (CV-MP) method that leverages real-time CV travel time information to compute the pressure, thereby incorporating both the spatial distribution and temporal delays of vehicles, unlike existing approaches that utilized only spatial distribution or temporal delays. In particular, we establish sufficient conditions for road network queue stability that are compatible with most existing MP control methods. Moreover, we pioneered the proof of network queue stability even if the vehicles are only partially connected and heterogeneously distributed, and gave a necessary condition of CV observation for maintaining the stability. Evaluation results on an Amsterdam corridor show that CV-MP significantly reduces vehicle delays compared to both actuated control and conventional MP control across various CV penetration rates. Moreover, in scenarios with dynamic traffic demand, CV-MP achieves lower spillover peaks even with low and heterogeneous CV penetration rates, further highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Location Search for Identifying Maximum Weighted Independent Sets in Complex Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04674v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Artificial intelligence (AI), including Generative AI, are effective at generating high-quality traffic data and optimization solutions in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), these techniques often demand significant training time and computational resources, especially in large-scale and complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce a novel and efficient algorithm for solving the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem, which can be used to model many ITSs applications, such as traffic signal control and vehicle routing. Given the NP-hard nature of the MWIS problem, our proposed algorithm, DynLS, incorporates three key innovations to solve it effectively. First, it uses a scores-based adaptive vertex perturbation (SAVP) technique to accelerate convergence, particularly in sparse graphs. Second, it includes a region location mechanism (RLM) to help escape local optima by dynamically adjusting the search space. Finally, it employs a novel variable neighborhood descent strategy, ComLS, which combines vertex exchange strategies with a reward mechanism to guide the search toward high-quality solutions. Our experimental results demonstrate DynLS's superior performance, consistently delivering high-quality solutions within 1000 seconds. DynLS outperformed five leading algorithms across 360 test instances, achieving the best solution for 350 instances and surpassing the second-best algorithm, Cyclic-Fast, by 177 instances. Moreover, DynLS matched Cyclic-Fast's convergence speed, highlighting its efficiency and practicality. This research represents a significant advancement in heuristic algorithms for the MWIS problem, offering a promising approach to aid AI techniques in optimizing intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05553v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC), enabling multiple intersections to coordinate signal timings in real time. However, in large-scale settings, MARL faces constraints due to extensive data sharing and communication requirements. Federated learning (FL) mitigates these challenges by training shared models without directly exchanging raw data, yet traditional FL methods such as FedAvg struggle with highly heterogeneous intersections. Different intersections exhibit varying traffic patterns, demands, and road structures, so performing FedAvg across all agents is inefficient. To address this gap, we propose Hierarchical Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL) for ATSC. HFRL employs clustering-based or optimization-based techniques to dynamically group intersections and perform FedAvg independently within groups of intersections with similar characteristics, enabling more effective coordination and scalability than standard FedAvg. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world traffic networks demonstrate that HFRL not only outperforms both decentralized and standard federated RL approaches but also identifies suitable grouping patterns based on network structure or traffic demand, resulting in a more robust framework for distributed, heterogeneous systems.</p></details> |  |

Signalized intersections are paramount for optimizing transportation efficiency and enhancing energy economy, as they inherently induce stop and go traffic dynamics. In this paper, we present an integrated framework that concurrently optimizes signal timing and CAV trajectories at signalized intersections, with the dual objectives of maximizing traffic throughput and minimizing energy consumption for CAVs. We first formulate an optimal control strategy for CAVs that prioritizes trajectory planning to circumvent state constraints, while incorporating the impact of signal timing and HDV behavior. Furthermore, we introduce a traffic signal control methodology that dynamically adjusts signal phases based on vehicular density per lane, while mitigating disruption for CAVs scheduled to traverse the intersection. Acknowledging the system's inherent dynamism, we also explore event triggered replanning mechanisms that enable CAVs to iteratively refine their planned trajectories in response to the emergence of more efficient routing options. The efficacy of our proposed framework is evaluated through comprehensive simulations in MATLAB.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent urban traffic management solutions.

Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) algorithms have emerged as a solution by dynamically adjusting signal timing based on real-time traffic conditions. However, the main limitation of such methods is that they are not transferable to environments under real-world constraints, such as balancing efficiency, minimizing collisions, and ensuring fairness across intersections. In this paper, we view the ATSC problem as a constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose a novel algorithm named Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with Lagrange Cost Estimator (MAPPO-LCE) to produce effective traffic signal control policies. Our approach integrates the Lagrange multipliers method to balance rewards and constraints, with a cost estimator for stable adjustment. We also introduce three constraints on the traffic network: GreenTime, GreenSkip, and PhaseSkip, which penalize traffic policies that do not conform to real-world scenarios. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MAPPO-LCE outperforms three baseline MARL algorithms by across all environments and traffic constraints (improving on MAPPO by 12.60%, IPPO by 10.29%, and QTRAN by 13.10%). Our results show that constrained MARL is a valuable tool for traffic planners to deploy scalable and efficient ATSC methods in real-world traffic networks.

However, most of the current traffic state representations are heuristically designed, with insufficient theoretical support. In this paper, we (1) develop a flexible, efficient, and theoretically grounded method, namely generalized phase pressure (G2P) control, which takes only simple lane features into consideration to decide which phase to be actuated; 2) extend the pressure control theory to a general form for multi-homogeneous-lane road networks based on queueing theory; (3) design a new traffic state representation based on the generalized phase state features from G2P control; and 4) develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm template named G2P-XLight, and two RL algorithms, G2P-MPLight and G2P-CoLight, by combining the generalized phase state representation with MPLight and CoLight, two well-performed RL methods for learning traffic signal control policies. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that G2P control outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) heuristic method in the transportation field and other recent human-designed heuristic methods; and that the newly proposed G2P-XLight significantly outperforms SOTA learning-based approaches.

An integral part of traffic management is understanding the turning movement counts (TMCs) at intersections, Accurate TMCs at intersections are crucial for traffic signal control, congestion mitigation, and road safety. In general, TMCs are obtained using physical sensors installed at intersections, but this approach can be cost-prohibitive and technically challenging, especially for cities with extensive road networks. Recent advancements in machine learning and data-driven approaches have offered promising alternatives for estimating TMCs. Traffic patterns can vary significantly across different intersections due to factors such as road geometry, traffic signal settings, and local driver behaviors. This domain discrepancy limits the generalizability and accuracy of machine learning models when applied to new or unseen intersections. In response to these limitations, this research proposes a novel framework leveraging domain adaptation (DA) to estimate TMCs at intersections by using traffic controller event-based data, road infrastructure data, and point-of-interest (POI) data. Evaluated on 30 intersections in Tucson, Arizona, the performance of the proposed DA framework was compared with state-of-the-art models and achieved the lowest values in terms of Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2412.09861</p></details> |

The burgeoning field of intelligent transportation systems, bolstered by artificial intelligence techniques and extensive data availability, offers new prospects for the implementation of ATSC. In this study, we introduce a parallel hybrid action space reinforcement learning model (PH-DDPG) that optimizes traffic signal phase and duration of traffic signals simultaneously, eliminating the need for sequential decision-making seen in traditional two-stage models. Our model features a task-specific parallel hybrid action space tailored for adaptive traffic control, which directly outputs discrete phase selections and their associated continuous duration parameters concurrently, thereby inherently addressing dynamic traffic adaptation through unified parametric optimization. %Our model features a unique parallel hybrid action space that allows for the simultaneous output of each action and its optimal parameters, streamlining the decision-making process. Furthermore, to ascertain the robustness and effectiveness of this approach, we executed ablation studies focusing on the utilization of a random action parameter mask within the critic network, which decouples the parameter space for individual actions, facilitating the use of preferable parameters for each action.

Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers adaptive solutions, but online MARL requires extensive interactions with the environment, making it costly and impractical. Offline MARL mitigates these challenges by using historical traffic data for training but faces significant difficulties with heterogeneous behavior policies in real-world datasets, where mixed-quality data complicates learning. We introduce OffLight, a novel offline MARL framework designed to handle heterogeneous behavior policies in TSC datasets. To improve learning efficiency, OffLight incorporates Importance Sampling (IS) to correct for distributional shifts and Return-Based Prioritized Sampling (RBPS) to focus on high-quality experiences. OffLight utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Variational Graph Autoencoder (GMM-VGAE) to capture the diverse distribution of behavior policies from local observations. Extensive experiments across real-world urban traffic scenarios show that OffLight outperforms existing offline RL methods, achieving up to a 7.8% reduction in average travel time and 11.2% decrease in queue length. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of OffLight's components in handling heterogeneous data and improving policy performance. These results highlight OffLight's scalability and potential to improve urban traffic management without the risks of online learning.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in parameter-sharing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have greatly enhanced the scalable and adaptive optimization of complex, dynamic flows in large-scale homogeneous networks. However, the inherent heterogeneity of real-world traffic networks, with their varied intersection topologies and interaction dynamics, poses substantial challenges to achieving scalable and effective ATSC across different traffic scenarios. To address these challenges, we present Unicorn, a universal and collaborative MARL framework designed for efficient and adaptable network-wide ATSC. Specifically, we first propose a unified approach to map the states and actions of intersections with varying topologies into a common structure based on traffic movements. Next, we design a Universal Traffic Representation (UTR) module with a decoder-only network for general feature extraction, enhancing the model's adaptability to diverse traffic scenarios. Additionally, we incorporate an Intersection Specifics Representation (ISR) module, designed to identify key latent vectors that represent the unique intersection's topology and traffic dynamics through variational inference techniques. To further refine these latent representations, we employ a contrastive learning approach in a self-supervised manner, which enables better differentiation of intersection-specific features. Moreover, we integrate the state-action dependencies of neighboring agents into policy optimization, which effectively captures dynamic agent interactions and facilitates efficient regional collaboration. Our results show that Unicorn outperforms other methods across various evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential in complex, dynamic traffic networks.</p></details> |  |

Within a model predictive control (MPC) framework, control policies consist of an algorithm that estimates parameters and a one-step MPC that computes control inputs using estimated parameters. The algorithm switches between different terminal sets of the MPC to explore different regions of the state space, where different parameters are identifiable. The one-step MPC minimizes a cost that approximates the sum of squares of all the queue lengths within a constant and does not require demand information. We show that the algorithm can estimate parameters exactly in finite time, and the one-step MPC renders maximum throughput in terms of input-to-state practical stability. Simulations indicate better transient performance regarding queue lengths under our proposed policies than existing ones.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

This paper puts forward a single-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based regional traffic signal control (TSC) model. Different from multi - agent systems, this model can coordinate traffic signals across a large area, with the goals of alleviating regional traffic congestion and minimizing the total travel time. The TSC environment is precisely defined through specific state space, action space, and reward functions. The state space consists of the current congestion state, which is represented by the queue lengths of each link, and the current signal phase scheme of intersections. The action space is designed to select an intersection first and then adjust its phase split. Two reward functions are meticulously crafted. One focuses on alleviating congestion and the other aims to minimize the total travel time while considering the congestion level. The experiments are carried out with the SUMO traffic simulation software. The performance of the TSC model is evaluated by comparing it with a base case where no signal-timing adjustments are made. The results show that the model can effectively control congestion. For example, the queuing length is significantly reduced in the scenarios tested. Moreover, when the reward is set to both alleviate congestion and minimize the total travel time, the average travel time is remarkably decreased, which indicates that the model can effectively improve traffic conditions. This research provides a new approach for large-scale regional traffic signal control and offers valuable insights for future urban traffic management.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2503.02279</p></details> |

However, current MARL-based methods often suffer from insufficient generalization due to the fixed traffic patterns and road network conditions used during training. This limitation results in poor adaptability to new traffic scenarios, leading to high retraining costs and complex deployment. To address this challenge, we propose two algorithms: PLight and PRLight. PLight employs a model-based reinforcement learning approach, pretraining control policies and environment models using predefined source-domain traffic scenarios. The environment model predicts the state transitions, which facilitates the comparison of environmental features. PRLight further enhances adaptability by adaptively selecting pre-trained PLight agents based on the similarity between the source and target domains to accelerate the learning process in the target domain. We evaluated the algorithms through two transfer settings: (1) adaptability to different traffic scenarios within the same road network, and (2) generalization across different road networks. The results show that PRLight significantly reduces the adaptation time compared to learning from scratch in new TSC scenarios, achieving optimal performance using similarities between available and target scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In traffic scenarios with multiple intersections, MARL treats each intersection as an agent and optimizes traffic signal control strategies through learning and real-time decision-making. Considering that observation distributions of intersections might be different in real-world scenarios, shared parameter methods might lack diversity and thus lead to high generalization requirements in the shared-policy network. A typical solution is to increase the size of network parameters. However, simply increasing the scale of the network does not necessarily improve policy generalization, which is validated in our experiments. Accordingly, an approach that considers both the personalization of intersections and the efficiency of parameter sharing is required. To this end, we propose Hyper-Action Multi-Head Proximal Policy Optimization (HAMH-PPO), a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL method that utilizes a shared PPO policy network to deliver personalized policies for intersections with non-iid observation distributions. The centralized critic in HAMH-PPO uses graph attention units to calculate the graph representations of all intersections and outputs a set of value estimates with multiple output heads for each intersection. The decentralized execution actor takes the local observation history as input and output distributions of action as well as a so-called hyper-action to balance the multiple values estimated from the centralized critic to further guide the updating of TSC policies. The combination of hyper-action and multi-head values enables multiple agents to share a single actor-critic while achieving personalized policies.</p></details> |  |

The proposed strategy requires CAVs, especially those with long remaining travel distances, to temporarily wait at nearby parking facilities when the network is congested. After a designated holding time, these CAVs are allowed to re-enter the network. Doing so helps reduce congestion and improve overall operational efficiency. Unlike traditional perimeter control approaches that restrict inflows to congested regions, the proposed holding strategy leverages existing parking infrastructure to temporarily hold vehicles in a way that partially avoids local queue accumulation issues. The proposed method can be easily integrated with existing signal control methods and retains the maximum stability property of the original traffic signal control methods. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy not only reduces travel time for vehicles that are not held, but can also reduce travel times for some of the held vehicles as well, which serves as another key merit of the proposed approach. Compared to the two benchmark perimeter control algorithms, the proposed strategy is more robust against demand patterns and generates stronger improvements in the operational efficiency. Importantly, since the proposed strategy requires existing parking infrastructure, its performance has been demonstrated under various configurations of parking locations and capacities. Particularly, it is demonstrated that the utilization of the parking facility consistently improves overall traffic efficiency, regardless of the facility's size. Lastly, the proposed strategy is shown to be beneficial in a partial CAV environment where only a subset of vehicles are available for holding.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamerV3 for Traffic Signal Control: Hyperparameter Tuning and Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02279v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has evolved into a widely investigated technology for the development of smart TSC strategies. However, current RL algorithms necessitate excessive interaction with the environment to learn effective policies, making them impractical for large-scale tasks. The DreamerV3 algorithm presents compelling properties for policy learning. It summarizes general dynamics knowledge about the environment and enables the prediction of future outcomes of potential actions from past experience, reducing the interaction with the environment through imagination training. In this paper, a corridor TSC model is trained using the DreamerV3 algorithm to explore the benefits of world models for TSC strategy learning. In RL environment design, to manage congestion levels effectively, both the state and reward functions are defined based on queue length, and the action is designed to manage queue length efficiently. Using the SUMO simulation platform, the two hyperparameters (training ratio and model size) of the DreamerV3 algorithm were tuned and analyzed across different OD matrix scenarios. We discovered that choosing a smaller model size and initially attempting several medium training ratios can significantly reduce the time spent on hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we found that the approach is generally applicable as it can solve two TSC task scenarios with the same hyperparameters. Regarding the claimed data-efficiency of the DreamerV3 algorithm, due to the significant fluctuation of the episode reward curve in the early stages of training, it can only be confirmed that larger model sizes exhibit modest data-efficiency, and no evidence was found that increasing the training ratio accelerates convergence.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Toward Dependency Dynamics in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16608v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) emerges as a promising data-driven approach for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) in complex urban traffic networks, with deep neural networks substantially augmenting its learning capabilities. However, centralized RL becomes impractical for ATSC involving multiple agents due to the exceedingly high dimensionality of the joint action space. Multi-agent RL (MARL) mitigates this scalability issue by decentralizing control to local RL agents. Nevertheless, this decentralized method introduces new challenges: the environment becomes partially observable from the perspective of each local agent due to constrained inter-agent communication. Both centralized RL and MARL exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses, particularly under heavy intersectional traffic conditions. In this paper, we justify that MARL can achieve the optimal global Q-value by separating into multiple IRL (Independent Reinforcement Learning) processes when no spill-back congestion occurs (no agent dependency) among agents (intersections). In the presence of spill-back congestion (with agent dependency), the maximum global Q-value can be achieved by using centralized RL. Building upon the conclusions, we propose a novel Dynamic Parameter Update Strategy for Deep Q-Network (DQN-DPUS), which updates the weights and bias based on the dependency dynamics among agents, i.e. updating only the diagonal sub-matrices for the scenario without spill-back congestion. We validate the DQN-DPUS in a simple network with two intersections under varying traffic, and show that the proposed strategy can speed up the convergence rate without sacrificing optimal exploration. The results corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the efficacy of DQN-DPUS in optimizing traffic signal control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communication Strategy on Macro-and-Micro Traffic State in Cooperative Deep Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13248v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) has become a popular research topic in intelligent transportation systems. Regional Traffic Signal Control (RTSC) using the Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) technique has become a promising approach for ATSC due to its ability to achieve the optimum trade-off between scalability and optimality. Most existing RTSC approaches partition a traffic network into several disjoint regions, followed by applying centralized reinforcement learning techniques to each region. However, the pursuit of cooperation among RTSC agents still remains an open issue and no communication strategy for RTSC agents has been investigated. In this paper, we propose communication strategies to capture the correlation of micro-traffic states among lanes and the correlation of macro-traffic states among intersections. We first justify the evolution equation of the RTSC process is Markovian via a system of store-and-forward queues. Next, based on the evolution equation, we propose two GAT-Aggregated (GA2) communication modules--GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug to extract both intra-region and inter-region correlations between macro and micro traffic states. While GA2-Naive only considers the movements at each intersection, GA2-Aug also considers the lane-changing behavior of vehicles. Two proposed communication modules are then aggregated into two existing novel RTSC frameworks--RegionLight and Regional-DRL. Experimental results demonstrate that both GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug effectively improve the performance of existing RTSC frameworks under both real and synthetic scenarios. Hyperparameter testing also reveals the robustness and potential of our communication modules in large-scale traffic networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FitLight: Federated Imitation Learning for Plug-and-Play Autonomous Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11937v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Traffic Signal Control (TSC) methods have been extensively studied, their practical applications still raise some serious issues such as high learning cost and poor generalizability. This is because the ``trial-and-error'' training style makes RL agents extremely dependent on the specific traffic environment, which also requires a long convergence time. To address these issues, we propose a novel Federated Imitation Learning (FIL)-based framework for multi-intersection TSC, named FitLight, which allows RL agents to plug-and-play for any traffic environment without additional pre-training cost. Unlike existing imitation learning approaches that rely on pre-training RL agents with demonstrations, FitLight allows real-time imitation learning and seamless transition to reinforcement learning. Due to our proposed knowledge-sharing mechanism and novel hybrid pressure-based agent design, RL agents can quickly find a best control policy with only a few episodes. Moreover, for resource-constrained TSC scenarios, FitLight supports model pruning and heterogeneous model aggregation, such that RL agents can work on a micro-controller with merely 16{\it KB} RAM and 32{\it KB} ROM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, FitLight not only provides a superior starting point but also converges to a better final solution on both real-world and synthetic datasets, even under extreme resource limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-hop Upstream Anticipatory Traffic Signal Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07271v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordination in traffic signal control is crucial for managing congestion in urban networks. Existing pressure-based control methods focus only on immediate upstream links, leading to suboptimal green time allocation and increased network delays. However, effective signal control inherently requires coordination across a broader spatial scope, as the effect of upstream traffic should influence signal control decisions at downstream intersections, impacting a large area in the traffic network. Although agent communication using neural network-based feature extraction can implicitly enhance spatial awareness, it significantly increases the learning complexity, adding an additional layer of difficulty to the challenging task of control in deep reinforcement learning. To address the issue of learning complexity and myopic traffic pressure definition, our work introduces a novel concept based on Markov chain theory, namely \textit{multi-hop upstream pressure}, which generalizes the conventional pressure to account for traffic conditions beyond the immediate upstream links. This farsighted and compact metric informs the deep reinforcement learning agent to preemptively clear the multi-hop upstream queues, guiding the agent to optimize signal timings with a broader spatial awareness. Simulations on synthetic and realistic (Toronto) scenarios demonstrate controllers utilizing multi-hop upstream pressure significantly reduce overall network delay by prioritizing traffic movements based on a broader understanding of upstream congestion.</p></details> | 5 tables, 11 figures |
| **[AMM: Adaptive Modularized Reinforcement Model for Multi-city Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02548v1)** | 2025-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control (TSC) is an important and widely studied direction. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been used to solve TSC problems and achieve superior performance over conventional TSC methods. However, applying RL methods to the real world is challenging due to the huge cost of experiments in real-world traffic environments. One possible solution is TSC domain adaptation, which adapts trained models to target environments and reduces the number of interactions and the training cost. However, existing TSC domain adaptation methods still face two major issues: the lack of consideration for differences across cities and the low utilization of multi-city data. To solve aforementioned issues, we propose an approach named Adaptive Modularized Model (AMM). By modularizing TSC problems and network models, we overcome the challenge of possible changes in environmental observations. We also aggregate multi-city experience through meta-learning. We conduct extensive experiments on different cities and show that AMM can achieve excellent performance with limited interactions in target environments and outperform existing methods. We also demonstrate the feasibility and generalizability of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Testing Stationarity and Change Point Detection in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01707v4)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods in possibly nonstationary environments. Many existing RL algorithms in the literature rely on the stationarity assumption that requires the system transition and the reward function to be constant over time. However, the stationarity assumption is restrictive in practice and is likely to be violated in a number of applications, including traffic signal control, robotics and mobile health. In this paper, we develop a consistent procedure to test the nonstationarity of the optimal Q-function based on pre-collected historical data, without additional online data collection. Based on the proposed test, we further develop a sequential change point detection method that can be naturally coupled with existing state-of-the-art RL methods for policy optimization in nonstationary environments. The usefulness of our method is illustrated by theoretical results, simulation studies, and a real data example from the 2018 Intern Health Study. A Python implementation of the proposed procedure is available at https://github.com/limengbinggz/CUSUM-RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Strategy for Urban Traffic Optimization: Prediction, Adaptive Signal Control, and Distributed Communication via Messaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02008v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces an integrated approach to optimizing urban traffic by combining predictive modeling of vehicle flow, adaptive traffic signal control, and a modular integration architecture through distributed messaging. Using real-time data from various sensors, the system anticipates traffic fluctuations and dynamically adjusts signal phase durations to minimize delays and improve traffic flow. This proactive adjustment, supported by algorithms inspired by simulated annealing and reinforcement learning, also enhances energy efficiency, reduces pollutant emissions, and responds effectively to unexpected events (adverse weather, accidents, or temporary gatherings). Preliminary simulations conducted in a realistic urban environment demonstrate a significant reduction in average waiting times. Future developments include incorporating data from connected vehicles, integrating new modes of transport, and continuously refining predictive models to address the growing challenges of urban mobility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Critique-Tune-Based Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Pressure for Multi-Intersection Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16225v2)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) system is a critical component of intelligent transportation, with the capability to significantly alleviate urban traffic congestion. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have demonstrated promising performance in achieving ATSC, existing methods are still prone to making unreasonable policies. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Critique-Tune-Based Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Pressure for multi-intersection signal control (BCT-APLight). In BCT-APLight, the Critique-Tune (CT) framework, a two-layer Bayesian structure is designed to refine the excessive trust of RL policies. Specifically, the Bayesian inference-based Critique Layer provides effective evaluations of the credibility of policies; the Bayesian decision-based Tune Layer fine-tunes policies by minimizing the posterior risks when the evaluations are negative. Meanwhile, an attention-based Adaptive Pressure (AP) mechanism is designed to effectively weight the vehicle queues in each lane, thereby enhancing the rationality of traffic movement representation within the network. Equipped with the CT framework and AP mechanism, BCT-APLight effectively enhances the reasonableness of RL policies. Extensive experiments conducted with a simulator across a range of intersection layouts demonstrate that BCT-APLight is superior to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on seven real-world datasets. Specifically, BCT-APLight decreases average queue length by \textbf{\(\boldsymbol{9.60\%}\)} and average waiting time by \textbf{\(\boldsymbol{15.28\%}\)}.</p></details> |  |

Current SOTA methods model road networks as topological graph structures, incorporate graph attention into deep Q-learning, and merge local and global embeddings to improve policy. However, graph-based methods are difficult to parallelize, resulting in huge time overhead. Moreover, none of the current peer studies have deployed dynamic traffic systems for experiments, which is far from the actual situation. In this context, we propose Multi-Scene Aggregation Convolutional Learning for traffic signal control (MacLight), which offers faster training speeds and more stable performance. Our approach consists of two main components. The first is the global representation, where we utilize variational autoencoders to compactly compress and extract the global representation. The second component employs the proximal policy optimization algorithm as the backbone, allowing value evaluation to consider both local features and global embedding representations. This backbone model significantly reduces time overhead and ensures stability in policy updates. We validated our method across multiple traffic scenarios under both static and dynamic traffic systems. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to general and domian SOTA methods, our approach achieves superior stability, optimized convergence levels and the highest time efficiency.

However, existing methods often struggle to generalize beyond their training environments to unseen scenarios with varying traffic dynamics. We present TransferLight, a novel framework designed for robust generalization across road-networks, diverse traffic conditions and intersection geometries. At its core, we propose a log-distance reward function, offering spatially-aware signal prioritization while remaining adaptable to varied lane configurations - overcoming the limitations of traditional pressure-based rewards. Our hierarchical, heterogeneous, and directed graph neural network architecture effectively captures granular traffic dynamics, enabling transferability to arbitrary intersection layouts. Using a decentralized multi-agent approach, global rewards, and novel state transition priors, we develop a single, weight-tied policy that scales zero-shot to any road network without re-training. Through domain randomization during training, we additionally enhance generalization capabilities. Experimental results validate TransferLight's superior performance in unseen scenarios, advancing practical, generalizable intelligent transportation systems to meet evolving urban traffic demands.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI Workshop Paper (MALTA)</p></details> |

Traditional TSC methods, primarily based on transportation engineering and reinforcement learning (RL), often struggle with generalization abilities across varied traffic scenarios and lack interpretability. This paper presents LLMLight, a novel framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) as decision-making agents for TSC. Specifically, the framework begins by instructing the LLM with a knowledgeable prompt detailing real-time traffic conditions. Leveraging the advanced generalization capabilities of LLMs, LLMLight engages a reasoning and decision-making process akin to human intuition for effective traffic control. Moreover, we build LightGPT, a specialized backbone LLM tailored for TSC tasks. By learning nuanced traffic patterns and control strategies, LightGPT enhances the LLMLight framework cost-effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-world and synthetic datasets, along with evaluations by fifteen human experts, demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness, generalization ability, and interpretability of LLMLight with LightGPT, outperforming nine baseline methods and ten advanced LLMs.</p></details> |  |

An integral part of traffic management is understanding the turning movement counts (TMCs) at intersections, Accurate TMCs at intersections are crucial for traffic signal control, congestion mitigation, and road safety. In general, TMCs are obtained using physical sensors installed at intersections, but this approach can be cost-prohibitive and technically challenging, especially for cities with extensive road networks. Recent advancements in machine learning and data-driven approaches have offered promising alternatives for estimating TMCs. Traffic patterns can vary significantly across different intersections due to factors such as road geometry, traffic signal settings, and local driver behaviors. This domain discrepancy limits the generalizability and accuracy of machine learning models when applied to new or unseen intersections. In response to these limitations, this research proposes a novel framework leveraging transfer learning (TL) to estimate TMCs at intersections by using traffic controller event-based data, road infrastructure data, and point-of-interest (POI) data. Evaluated on 30 intersections in Tucson, Arizona, the performance of the proposed TL model was compared with eight state-of-the-art regression models and achieved the lowest values in terms of Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces an intersection-aware emergency medical service (EMS) accessibility model to evaluate and improve EMV travel times across NYC. Integrating intersection density metrics, road network characteristics, and demographic data, the model identifies vulnerable regions with inadequate EMS coverage. The analysis reveals that densely interconnected areas, such as parts of Staten Island, Queens, and Manhattan, experience significant accessibility deficits due to intersection delays and sparse medical infrastructure. To address these challenges, this study explores the adoption of EMVLight, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, which demonstrates the potential to reduce intersection delays by 50\%, increasing EMS accessibility to 95\% of NYC residents within the critical benchmark of 4 minutes. Results indicate that advanced traffic signal control (TSC) systems can alleviate congestion-induced delays while improving equity in emergency response. The findings provide actionable insights for urban planning and policy interventions to enhance EMS accessibility and ensure timely care for underserved populations.</p></details> |  |

Intelligent transportation, leveraging advanced computer algorithms, could further increase people's daily commuting efficiency. However, intelligent transportation, as a cross-discipline, often requires practitioners to comprehend complicated algorithms and obscure neural networks, bringing a challenge for the advanced techniques to be trusted and deployed in practical industries. Recognizing the expressiveness of the pre-trained large language models, especially the potential of being augmented with abilities to understand and execute intricate commands, we introduce Open-TI.

The first part of the study develops adaptive signal control based on MARL for a pair of coordinated intersections in a microscopic simulation environment. The two agents, one for each intersection, are centrally trained using a value decomposition network (VDN) architecture. The trained agents show slightly better performance compared to coordinated actuated signal control based on overall intersection delay at v/c of 0.95. In the second part of the study the trained signal control agents are used as background signal controllers while developing event-based TSP agents. In one variation, independent TSP agents are formulated and trained under a decentralized training and decentralized execution (DTDE) framework to implement TSP at each intersection. In the second variation, the two TSP agents are centrally trained under a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework and VDN architecture to select and implement coordinated TSP strategies across the two intersections. In both cases the agents converge to the same bus delay value, but independent agents show high instability throughout the training process. For the test runs, the two independent agents reduce bus delay across the two intersections by 22% compared to the no TSP case while the coordinated TSP agents achieve 27% delay reduction. In both cases, there is only a slight increase in delay for a majority of the side street movements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Traffic Signal Control using High-Dimensional State Representation and Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07759v1)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reinforcement learning-based (RL-based) traffic signal control (TSC), decisions on the signal timing are made based on the available information on vehicles at a road intersection. This forms the state representation for the RL environment which can either be high-dimensional containing several variables or a low-dimensional vector. Current studies suggest that using high dimensional state representations does not lead to improved performance on TSC. However, we argue, with experimental results, that the use of high dimensional state representations can, in fact, lead to improved TSC performance with improvements up to 17.9% of the average waiting time. This high-dimensional representation is obtainable using the cost-effective vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, encouraging its adoption for TSC. Additionally, given the large size of the state, we identified the need to have computational efficient models and explored model compression via pruning.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, they can also be the bottleneck of traffic flows as a result of traffic incidents or the absence of traffic coordination mechanisms such as traffic lights. Recently, various control and coordination mechanisms that are beyond traditional control methods have been proposed to improve the efficiency of intersection traffic by leveraging the ability of autonomous vehicles. Amongst these methods, the control of foreseeable mixed traffic that consists of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and robot vehicles (RVs) has emerged. We propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for the control and coordination of mixed traffic by RVs at real-world, complex intersections -- an open challenge to date. We design comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness, robustness, generalizablility, and adaptability of our approach. In particular, our method can prevent congestion formation via merely 5% RVs under a real-world traffic demand of 700 vehicles per hour. In contrast, without RVs, congestion will form when the traffic demand reaches as low as 200 vehicles per hour. Moreover, when the RV penetration rate exceeds 60%, our method starts to outperform traffic signal control in terms of the average waiting time of all vehicles. Our method is not only robust against blackout events, sudden RV percentage drops, and V2V communication error, but also enjoys excellent generalizablility, evidenced by its successful deployment in five unseen intersections. Lastly, our method performs well under various traffic rules, demonstrating its adaptability to diverse scenarios.

However, most existing works for TSC assume that traffic data from all surrounding intersections is fully and continuously available through sensors. In real-world applications, this assumption often fails due to sensor malfunctions or data loss, making TSC with missing data a critical challenge. To meet the needs of practical applications, we introduce DiffLight, a novel conditional diffusion model for TSC under data-missing scenarios in the offline setting. Specifically, we integrate two essential sub-tasks, i.e., traffic data imputation and decision-making, by leveraging a Partial Rewards Conditioned Diffusion (PRCD) model to prevent missing rewards from interfering with the learning process. Meanwhile, to effectively capture the spatial-temporal dependencies among intersections, we design a Spatial-Temporal transFormer (STFormer) architecture. In addition, we propose a Diffusion Communication Mechanism (DCM) to promote better communication and control performance under data-missing scenarios. Extensive experiments on five datasets with various data-missing scenarios demonstrate that DiffLight is an effective controller to address TSC with missing data.

One promising solution to tackle this problem is intelligent traffic signal control (TSC). Recently, TSC strategies leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) have garnered attention among researchers. However, the evaluation of these models has primarily relied on fixed metrics like reward and queue length. This limited evaluation approach provides only a narrow view of the model's decision-making process, impeding its practical implementation. Moreover, effective TSC necessitates coordinated actions across multiple intersections. Existing visual analysis solutions fall short when applied in multi-agent settings. In this study, we delve into the challenge of interpretability in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), particularly within the context of TSC. We propose MARLens a visual analytics system tailored to understand MARL-based TSC. Our system serves as a versatile platform for both RL and TSC researchers. It empowers them to explore the model's features from various perspectives, revealing its decision-making processes and shedding light on interactions among different agents. To facilitate quick identification of critical states, we have devised multiple visualization views, complemented by a traffic simulation module that allows users to replay specific training scenarios. To validate the utility of our proposed system, we present three comprehensive case studies, incorporate insights from domain experts through interviews, and conduct a user study. These collective efforts underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of MARLens in enhancing our understanding of MARL-based TSC systems and pave the way for more informed and efficient traffic management strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures; Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 2024</p></details> |

Learning-based optimization methods require extensive interactions with highly realistic microscopic traffic simulators. However, existing microscopic traffic simulators are inefficient in large-scale scenarios and thus fail to support the adoption of these methods in large-scale transportation system optimization scenarios. In addition, the optimization scenarios supported by existing simulators are limited, mainly focusing on the traffic signal control. To address these challenges, we propose the first open-source GPU-accelerated large-scale microscopic simulator for transportation system simulation and optimization. The simulator can iterate at 84.09Hz, which achieves 88.92 times computational acceleration in the large-scale scenario with 2,464,950 vehicles compared to the best baseline CityFlow. Besides, it achieves a more realistic average road speeds simulated on real datasets by adopting the IDM model as the car-following model and the randomized MOBIL model as the lane-changing model. Based on it, we implement a set of microscopic and macroscopic controllable objects and metrics provided by Python API to support typical transportation system optimization scenarios. We choose five representative scenarios and benchmark classical rule-based algorithms, reinforcement learning algorithms, and black-box optimization algorithms in four cities. These experiments effectively demonstrate the usability of the simulator for large-scale traffic system optimization. The code of the simulator is available at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/moss. We build an open-registration web platform available at https://moss.fiblab.net to support no-code trials.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR2025</p></details> |

However, in current decades, it continues to pose significant challenges in managing large-scale traffic networks, coordinating intersections, and ensuring robustness under uncertain traffic conditions. This paper presents a scalable multi-objective optimization approach for robust traffic signal control in dynamic and uncertain urban environments. A multi-objective optimization model is proposed in this paper, which incorporates stochastic variables and probabilistic traffic patterns to capture traffic flow dynamics and uncertainty. We propose an algorithm named Adaptive Hybrid Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithm (AHMOA), which addresses the uncertainties of city traffic, including network-wide signal coordination, fluctuating patterns, and environmental impacts. AHMOA simultaneously optimizes multiple objectives, such as average delay, network stability, and system robustness, while adapting to unpredictable changes in traffic. The algorithm combines evolutionary strategies with an adaptive mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation, and incorporates a memory-based evaluation mechanism to leverage historical traffic data. Simulations are conducted in different cities including Manhattan, Paris, Sao Paulo, and Istanbul. The experimental results demonstrate that AHMOA consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms and the algorithm is competent to provide scalable, robust Pareto optimal solutions for managing complex traffic systems under uncertain environments.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

However, the complexity of traffic networks has rendered traditional machine learning and statistical methods less effective. With the advent of artificial intelligence, deep learning frameworks have achieved remarkable progress across various fields and are now considered highly effective in many areas. Since 2019, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a particularly promising deep learning approach within the ITS domain, owing to their robust ability to model graph-structured data and address complex problems. Consequently, there has been increasing scholarly attention to the applications of GNNs in transportation, which have demonstrated excellent performance. Nevertheless, current research predominantly focuses on traffic forecasting, with other ITS domains, such as autonomous vehicles and demand prediction, receiving less attention. This paper aims to review the applications of GNNs across six representative and emerging ITS research areas: traffic forecasting, vehicle control system, traffic signal control, transportation safety, demand prediction, and parking management. We have examined a wide range of graph-related studies from 2018 to 2023, summarizing their methodologies, features, and contributions in detailed tables and lists. Additionally, we identify the challenges of applying GNNs in ITS and propose potential future research directions.</p></details> |  |

While numerous studies have addressed the issue of intelligent traffic systems in the context of various disturbances, traffic signal malfunction, a common real-world occurrence with significant repercussions, has received comparatively limited attention. The primary objective of this research is to mitigate the adverse effects of traffic signal malfunction, such as traffic congestion and collision, by optimizing the control of neighboring functioning signals. To achieve this goal, this paper presents a novel traffic signal control framework (MalLight), which leverages an Influence-aware State Aggregation Module (ISAM) and an Influence-aware Reward Aggregation Module (IRAM) to achieve coordinated control of surrounding traffic signals. To the best of our knowledge, this study pioneers the application of a Reinforcement Learning(RL)-based approach to address the challenges posed by traffic signal malfunction.

As an alternative, optimizing existing traffic management systems, particularly through adaptive traffic signal control, offers a promising solution. This paper explores the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance traffic signal operations at intersections, aiming to reduce congestion without extensive sensor networks. We introduce two RL-based algorithms: a turn-based agent, which dynamically prioritizes traffic signals based on real-time queue lengths, and a time-based agent, which adjusts signal phase durations according to traffic conditions while following a fixed phase cycle. By representing the state as a scalar queue length, our approach simplifies the learning process and lowers deployment costs. The algorithms were tested in four distinct traffic scenarios using seven evaluation metrics to comprehensively assess performance. Simulation results demonstrate that both RL algorithms significantly outperform conventional traffic signal control systems, highlighting their potential to improve urban traffic flow efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Traditional forecasting methods, however, struggle with the irregular traffic time series resulting from adaptive traffic signal controls, presenting challenges in asynchronous spatial dependency, irregular temporal dependency, and predicting variable-length sequences. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) tailored for irregular traffic time series forecasting. Specifically, we first propose an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to capture the spatial dependency between asynchronously measured traffic states regulated by adaptive traffic signals. After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state sequences, a personalized time encoding is devised to embed the continuous time signals. Then, we propose a Transformable Time-aware Convolution Network, which adapts meta-filters for time-aware convolution on the sequences with inconsistent temporal flow. Additionally, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network, comprising a state evolution unit and a semi-autoregressive predictor, is designed to predict variable-length traffic sequences effectively and efficiently. Extensive experiments on a newly established benchmark demonstrate the superiority of ASeer compared with twelve competitive baselines across six metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in the research track of KDD 2024</p></details> |

However, MP-based signal control algorithms do not differentiate the movement of transit vehicles from private vehicles or between high and single-occupancy private vehicles. Prioritizing the movement of transit or other high occupancy vehicles (HOVs) is vital to reduce congestion and improve the reliability and efficiency of transit operations. This study proposes OCC-MP: a novel MP-based algorithm that considers both vehicle queues and passenger occupancies in computing the weights of movements. By weighing movements with higher passenger occupancies more heavily, transit and other HOVs are implicitly provided with priority, while accounting for any negative impacts of that priority on single occupancy vehicles. And, unlike rule-based transit signal priority (TSP) strategies, OCC-MP more naturally also accommodates conflicting transit routes at a signalized intersection and facilitates their movement, even in mixed traffic without dedicated lanes. Simulations on a grid network under varying demands and transit configurations demonstrate the effectiveness of OCC-MP at providing TSP while simultaneously reducing the negative impact imparted onto lower occupancy private vehicles. Furthermore, OCC-MP is shown to have a larger stable region for demand compared to rule-based TSP strategies integrated into the MP framework. The performance of OCC-MP is also shown to be robust to errors in passenger occupancy information from transit vehicles and can be applied when passenger occupancies of private vehicles are not available. Finally, OCC-MP can be applied in a partially connected vehicle (CV) environment when a subset of vehicles is able to provide information to the signal controller, outperforming baseline methods at low CV penetration rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will be published in Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies</p></details> |

The RL agent directly determines the duration of the next phase in a pre-defined sequence. Before the RL agent's decision is executed, we use the shock wave theory to estimate queue expansion at the designated movement allowed for re-service and decide if phase re-service is necessary. If necessary, a temporary phase re-service is inserted before the next regular phase. We formulate the RL problem as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) and solve it with proximal policy optimization (PPO). We conducted a series of experiments that showed significant improvements thanks to the introduction of phase re-service. Vehicle delays are reduced by up to 29.95% of the average and up to 59.21% of the standard deviation. The number of stops is reduced by 26.05% on average with 45.77% less standard deviation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ITSC 2024</p></details> |

The proposed approach aims to enhance control strategies at intersections while simultaneously addressing safety, efficiency, and decarbonization objectives. Traditional ATSC methods typically prioritize traffic efficiency and often struggle to adapt to real-time dynamic traffic conditions. To address these challenges, the study suggests a DRL-based ATSC algorithm that incorporates the Dueling Double Deep Q Network (D3QN) framework. The performance of this algorithm is assessed using a simulated intersection in Changsha, China. Notably, the proposed ATSC algorithm surpasses both traditional ATSC and ATSC algorithms focused solely on efficiency optimization by achieving over a 16% reduction in traffic conflicts and a 4% decrease in carbon emissions. Regarding traffic efficiency, waiting time is reduced by 18% compared to traditional ATSC, albeit showing a slight increase (0.64%) compared to the DRL-based ATSC algorithm integrating the D3QN framework. This marginal increase suggests a trade-off between efficiency and other objectives like safety and decarbonization. Additionally, the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance, particularly in scenarios with high traffic demand, across all three objectives. These findings contribute to advancing traffic control systems by offering a practical and effective solution for optimizing signal control strategies in real-world traffic situations.</p></details> |  |

This study extends RL - based traffic control to include TSP. Using a microscopic simulation environment and connected vehicle data, the study develops and tests a TSP event-based RL agent that assumes control from another developed RL - based general traffic signal controller. The TSP agent assumes control when transit buses enter the dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) zone of the intersection. This agent is shown to reduce the bus travel time by about 21%, with marginal impacts to general traffic at a saturation rate of 0.95. The TSP agent also shows slightly better bus travel time compared to actuated signal control with TSP. The architecture of the agent and simulation is selected considering the need to improve simulation run time efficiency.</p></details> |  |

| **[GuideLight: "Industrial Solution" Guidance for More Practical Traffic Signal Control Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10811v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, traffic signal control (TSC) methods based on reinforcement learning (RL) have proven superior to traditional methods. However, most RL methods face difficulties when applied in the real world due to three factors: input, output, and the cycle-flow relation. The industry's observable input is much more limited than simulation-based RL methods. For real-world solutions, only flow can be reliably collected, whereas common RL methods need more. For the output action, most RL methods focus on acyclic control, which real-world signal controllers do not support. Most importantly, industry standards require a consistent cycle-flow relationship: non-decreasing and different response strategies for low, medium, and high-level flows, which is ignored by the RL methods. To narrow the gap between RL methods and industry standards, we innovatively propose to use industry solutions to guide the RL agent. Specifically, we design behavior cloning and curriculum learning to guide the agent to mimic and meet industry requirements and, at the same time, leverage the power of exploration and exploitation in RL for better performance. We theoretically prove that such guidance can largely decrease the sample complexity to polynomials in the horizon when searching for an optimal policy. Our rigid experiments show that our method has good cycle-flow relation and superior performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review of IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

Adaptive traffic signal control, which considers traffic conditions, has thus attracted attention. However, it is difficult to ensure optimal vehicle flow throughout a large city using existing control methods because of their heavy computational load. Here, we propose a control method called AMPIC (Adaptive Model Predictive Ising Controller) that guarantees both scalability and optimality. The proposed method employs model predictive control to solve an optimal control problem at each control interval with explicit consideration of a predictive model of vehicle flow. This optimal control problem is transformed into a combinatorial optimization problem with binary variables that is equivalent to the so-called Ising problem. This transformation allows us to use an Ising solver, which has been widely studied and is expected to have fast and efficient optimization performance. We performed numerical experiments using a microscopic traffic simulator for a realistic city road network. The results show that AMPIC enables faster vehicle cruising speed with less waiting time than that achieved by classical control methods, resulting in lower CO2 emissions. The model predictive approach with a long prediction horizon thus effectively improves control performance. Systematic parametric studies on model cities indicate that the proposed method realizes smoother traffic flows for large city road networks. Among Ising solvers, D-Wave's quantum annealing is shown to find near-optimal solutions at a reasonable computational cost.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

TSC is often modeled as a Markov Decision Process problem and then solved using reinforcement learning (RL), which has proven effective. However, the existing RL-based TSC system often overlooks imperfect observations caused by degraded communication, such as packet loss, delays, and noise, as well as rare real-life events not included in the reward function, such as unconsidered emergency vehicles. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel integration framework that combines a large language model (LLM) with RL. This framework is designed to manage overlooked elements in the reward function and gaps in state information, thereby enhancing the policies of RL agents. In our approach, RL initially makes decisions based on observed data. Subsequently, LLMs evaluate these decisions to verify their reasonableness. If a decision is found to be unreasonable, it is adjusted accordingly. Additionally, this integration approach can be seamlessly integrated with existing RL-based TSC systems without necessitating modifications. Extensive testing confirms that our approach reduces the average waiting time by $17.5\%$ in degraded communication conditions as compared to traditional RL methods, underscoring its potential to advance practical RL applications in intelligent transportation systems.

| **[C-MP: A decentralized adaptive-coordinated traffic signal control using the Max Pressure framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01421v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated traffic signals seek to provide uninterrupted flow through a series of closely spaced intersections, typically using pre-defined fixed signal timings and offsets. Adaptive traffic signals dynamically change signal timings based on observed traffic conditions in a way that might disrupt coordinated movements, particularly when these decisions are made independently at each intersection. To alleviate this issue, this paper introduces a novel Max Pressure-based traffic signal framework that can provide coordination even under decentralized decision-making. The proposed Coordinated Max Pressure (C-MP) algorithm uses the space mean speeds of vehicles to explicitly detect freely flowing platoons of vehicles and prioritizes their movement along a corridor. Specifically, upstream platoons are detected and their weight in the MP framework increased to provide priority, while downstream platoons are detected and their weight reduced to ensure smooth traffic flow across corridors. The study analytically proves that C-MP maintains the desirable maximum stability property, while micro-simulation analyses conducted on an arterial network demonstrate its ability to achieve a larger stable region compared to benchmark MP control policies. Simulation results also reveal that the proposed control algorithm can effectively coordinate traffic signals in both directions along an arterial without explicitly assigned offsets or constraints. The results also reveal C-MP's superiority to benchmark coordination strategies in reducing travel time, and fuel consumption both at the corridor level and the network level by balancing the negative impact imparted to vehicles in the minor direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies</p></details> |

Specifically, the selection policy in real-time adaptively selects the best teammates according to phase- and intersection-level features.

Therefore, effective congestion management is imperative, with traffic signal control (TSC) systems being pivotal in this endeavor. Conventional TSC systems, designed upon rule-based algorithms or reinforcement learning (RL), frequently exhibit deficiencies in managing the complexities and variabilities of urban traffic flows, constrained by their limited capacity for adaptation to unfamiliar scenarios. In response to these limitations, this work introduces an innovative approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into TSC, harnessing their advanced reasoning and decision-making faculties. Specifically, a hybrid framework that augments LLMs with a suite of perception and decision-making tools is proposed, facilitating the interrogation of both the static and dynamic traffic information. This design places the LLM at the center of the decision-making process, combining external traffic data with established TSC methods. Moreover, a simulation platform is developed to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed framework. The findings from our simulations attest to the system's adeptness in adjusting to a multiplicity of traffic environments without the need for additional training. Notably, in cases of Sensor Outage (SO), our approach surpasses conventional RL-based systems by reducing the average waiting time by $20.4\%$. This research signifies a notable advance in TSC strategies and paves the way for the integration of LLMs into real-world, dynamic scenarios, highlighting their potential to revolutionize traffic management.

Our method features an adjust all phases action design, enabling simultaneous phase changes within the signal cycle, which fosters both immediate stability and sustained TSC effectiveness, especially at lower frequencies. The approach also integrates decentralized actors to handle the complexity of the action space, with a centralized critic to ensure coordinated phase adjusting. Extensive testing on both synthetic and real-world data across different intersection types and signal setups shows that our method significantly outperforms other popular techniques, particularly at high control intervals.

| **[Perimeter Control with Heterogeneous Metering Rates for Cordon Signals: A Physics-Regularized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12985v2)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perimeter Control (PC) strategies have been proposed to address urban road network control in oversaturated situations by regulating the transfer flow of the Protected Network (PN) based on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). The uniform metering rate for cordon signals in most existing studies overlooks the variance of local traffic states at the intersection level, which may cause severe local traffic congestion and degradation of the network stability. PC strategies with heterogeneous metering rates for cordon signals allow precise control for the perimeter but the complexity of the problem increases exponentially with the scale of the PN. This paper leverages a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based traffic signal control framework to decompose this PC problem, which considers heterogeneous metering rates for cordon signals, into multi-agent cooperation tasks. Each agent controls an individual signal located in the cordon, decreasing the dimension of action space for the controller compared to centralized methods. A physics regularization approach for the MARL framework is proposed to ensure the distributed cordon signal controllers are aware of the global network state by encoding MFD-based knowledge into the action-value functions of the local agents. The proposed PC strategy is operated as a two-stage system, with a feedback PC strategy detecting the overall traffic state within the PN and then distributing local instructions to cordon signals controllers in the MARL framework via the physics regularization. Through numerical tests with different demand patterns in a microscopic traffic environment, the proposed PC strategy shows promising robustness and transferability. It outperforms state-of-the-art feedback PC strategies in increasing network throughput, decreasing distributed delay for gate links, and reducing carbon emissions.</p></details> | 21 pages, 24 figures |

To address this issue, various tools can exert influence on traffic safety both directly and indirectly. This study focuses on investigating the impact of adaptive signal control and connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) on intersection safety using a deep reinforcement learning approach. The objective is to assess the individual and combined effects of CAVs and adaptive traffic signal control on traffic safety, considering rear-end and crossing conflicts. The study employs a Deep Q Network (DQN) to regulate traffic signals and driving behaviors of both CAVs and Human Drive Vehicles (HDVs), and uses Time To Collision (TTC) metric to evaluate safety. The findings demonstrate a significant reduction in rear-end and crossing conflicts through the combined implementation of CAVs and DQNs-based traffic signal control. Additionally, the long-term positive effects of CAVs on safety are similar to the short-term effects of combined CAVs and DQNs-based traffic signal control. Overall, the study emphasizes the potential benefits of integrating CAVs and adaptive traffic signal control approaches in order to enhance traffic safety. The findings of this study could provide valuable insights for city officials and transportation authorities in developing effective strategies to improve safety at signalized intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>TRB 1...</summary><p>TRB 103nd Annual Meeting</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Stabilize Online Reinforcement Learning in Unbounded State Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01896v3)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, we want policies that reach desired states and then keep the controlled system within an acceptable region around the desired states over an indefinite period of time. This latter objective is called stability and is especially important when the state space is unbounded, such that the states can be arbitrarily far from each other and the agent can drift far away from the desired states. For example, in stochastic queuing networks, where queues of waiting jobs can grow without bound, the desired state is all-zero queue lengths. Here, a stable policy ensures queue lengths are finite while an optimal policy minimizes queue lengths. Since an optimal policy is also stable, one would expect that RL algorithms would implicitly give us stable policies. However, in this work, we find that deep RL algorithms that directly minimize the distance to the desired state during online training often result in unstable policies, i.e., policies that drift far away from the desired state. We attribute this instability to poor credit-assignment for destabilizing actions. We then introduce an approach based on two ideas: 1) a Lyapunov-based cost-shaping technique and 2) state transformations to the unbounded state space. We conduct an empirical study on various queueing networks and traffic signal control problems and find that our approach performs competitively against strong baselines with knowledge of the transition dynamics.

A pipeline for intersection data imputation from OpenStreetMap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13480v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signalized intersections, arguably the most complicated type of traffic scenario, are essential to urban mobility systems. With recent advancements in intelligent transportation technologies, signalized intersections have great prospects for making transportation greener, safer, and faster. Several studies have been conducted focusing on intersection-level control and optimization. However, arbitrarily structured signalized intersections that are often used do not represent the ground-truth distribution, and there is no standardized way that exists to extract information about real-world signalized intersections. As the largest open-source map in the world, OpenStreetMap (OSM) has been used by many transportation researchers for a variety of studies, including intersection-level research such as adaptive traffic signal control and eco-driving. However, the quality of OSM data has been a serious concern. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for effectively extracting information about signalized intersections from OSM and constructing a comprehensive dataset. We thoroughly discuss challenges related to this task and we propose our solution for each challenge. We also use Salt Lake City as an example to demonstrate the performance of our methods. The pipeline has been published as an open-source Python library so everyone can freely download and use it to facilitate their research. Hopefully, this paper can serve as a starting point that inspires more efforts to build a standardized and systematic data pipeline for various types of transportation problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DataLight: Offline Data-Driven Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10828v2)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising solution for addressing traffic signal control (TSC) challenges. While most RL-based TSC systems typically employ an online approach, facilitating frequent active interaction with the environment, learning such strategies in the real world is impractical due to safety and risk concerns. To tackle these challenges, this study introduces an innovative offline data-driven approach, called DataLight. DataLight employs effective state representations and reward function by capturing vehicular speed information within the environment. It then segments roads to capture spatial information and further enhances the spatially segmented state representations with sequential modeling. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DataLight, showcasing superior performance compared to both state-of-the-art online and offline TSC methods. Additionally, DataLight exhibits robust learning capabilities concerning real-world deployment issues.

However, most existing RL methodologies are confined to a single-stage TSC framework, primarily focusing on selecting an appropriate traffic signal phase at fixed action intervals, leading to inflexible and less adaptable phase durations. To address such limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage TSC framework named DynamicLight. This framework initiates with a phase control strategy responsible for determining the optimal traffic phase, followed by a duration control strategy tasked with determining the corresponding phase duration. Experimental results show that DynamicLight outperforms state-of-the-art TSC models and exhibits exceptional model generalization capabilities. Additionally, the robustness and potential for real-world implementation of DynamicLight are further demonstrated and validated through various DynamicLight variants. The code is released at https://github.com/LiangZhang1996/DynamicLight.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

The proposed Coordinated Maximum Pressure-plus-Penalty (CMPP) control policy features a local objective for each intersection that consists of the total pressure within the neighborhood and a penalty accounting for the queue capacities and continuous green time for certain movements. The corresponding control task is reformulated as a distributed optimization problem and solved via two customized algorithms: one based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the other follows a greedy heuristic augmented with a majority vote. CMPP not only provides a theoretical guarantee of queuing network stability but also outperforms several benchmark controllers in simulations on a large-scale real traffic network with lower average travel and waiting time per vehicle, as well as less network congestion. Furthermore, CPMM with the greedy algorithm enjoys comparable computational efficiency as fully decentralized controllers without significantly compromising the control performance, which highlights its great potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uninterrupted Maximum Flow on Signalized Traffic Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16592v2)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes a traffic signal control strategy that allows motorists who travel at a recommended speed on suburban arterial two-way roads with a common cycle time to make every traffic signal. A road-to-traveler-feedback-device (RTFD) advises motorists how fast they should travel to do this. Signalized arterial roads where vehicles that travel at the recommended speed make every traffic signal are termed Ride-the-Green-Wave (RGW) roads. Left-turn-arounds enable vehicles to turn left from two-way RGW-roads to intersecting/orthogonal two-way RGW-road while allowing maximum flow at the intersection. The traffic signal control technique that enables vehicles that travel at the recommended speed to make every traffic signal has been verified using a simulation program (RGW-SIM). In addition to introducing novel traffic signal control strategies, the methods presented in this paper have implications for road network design, public transport control, connected and automated vehicles and environmental impacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 30 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, it presents unique challenges, due to the complex roadway layout at intersections, involvement of traffic signal controls, and interactions among different types of road users. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel model called Knowledge-Informed Generative Adversarial Network (KI-GAN), which integrates both traffic signal information and multi-vehicle interactions to predict vehicle trajectories accurately. Additionally, we propose a specialized attention pooling method that accounts for vehicle orientation and proximity at intersections. Based on the SinD dataset, our KI-GAN model is able to achieve an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 0.05 and a Final Displacement Error (FDE) of 0.12 for a 6-second observation and 6-second prediction cycle. When the prediction window is extended to 9 seconds, the ADE and FDE values are further reduced to 0.11 and 0.26, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed KI-GAN model in vehicle trajectory prediction under complex scenarios at signalized intersections, which represents a significant advancement in the target field.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 CVPR AICity Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Traffic Signal Control and Speed Offset Coordination Using Q-Learning for Arterial Road Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06382v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arterial traffic interacts with freeway traffic, yet the two are controlled independently. Arterial traffic signals do not take into account freeway traffic and how ramps control ingress traffic and have no control over egress traffic from the freeway. This often results in long queues in either direction that block ramps and spill over to arterial streets or freeway lanes. In this paper, we propose an adaptive arterial traffic control strategy that combines traffic signal control (TSC) and dynamic speed offset (DSO) coordination using a Q-learning algorithm for a traffic network that involves a freeway segment and adjacent arterial streets. The TSC agent computes the signal cycle length and split based on observed intersection demands and adjacent freeway off-ramp queues. The DSO agent computes the relative offset and the recommended speeds of both ways between consecutive intersections based on their physical distance, intersection queues, and signal cycles. We evaluate the performance of the proposed arterial traffic control strategy using microscopic traffic simulations of an arterial corridor with seven intersections near the I-710 freeway. The proposed QL-based control significantly outperforms a fixed-time control and MAXBAND in terms of the travel time and the number of stops under low or moderate demands. In high-demand scenarios, the travel-time benefit provided by the QL-based control is reduced as it mitigates off-ramp and intersection queues, which is a necessary trade-off in our perspective. In addition, mutual benefit is obtained by implementing freeway and arterial traffic control simultaneously.</p></details> | submitted to TR-C |

This issue is particularly pressing in light of the recent growing interest in designing graph foundation models. These models are supposed to be able to transfer to diverse graph datasets from different domains, and yet the proposed graph foundation models are often evaluated on a very limited set of datasets from narrow applications. To alleviate this issue, we introduce GraphLand: a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction from a range of different industrial applications. GraphLand allows evaluating graph ML models on a wide range of graphs with diverse sizes, structural characteristics, and feature sets, all in a unified setting. Further, GraphLand allows investigating such previously underexplored research questions as how realistic temporal distributional shifts under transductive and inductive settings influence graph ML model performance. To mimic realistic industrial settings, we use GraphLand to compare GNNs with gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) models that are popular in industrial applications and show that GBDTs provided with additional graph-based input features can sometimes be very strong baselines. Further, we evaluate currently available general-purpose graph foundation models and find that they fail to produce competitive results on our proposed datasets.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of spatial computing communications (SCC), a framework designed to meet the latency and energy demands of multi-user VR over distributed mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. SCC jointly represents the physical space, defined by users and base stations, and the virtual space, representing shared immersive environments, using a probabilistic model of user dynamics and resource requirements. The resource deployment task is then formulated as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem that simultaneously minimizes system latency and energy consumption across distributed MEC resources. To solve this problem, we propose MO-CMPO, a multi-objective consistency model with policy optimization that integrates supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by preference weights. Leveraging a sparse graph neural network (GNN), MO-CMPO efficiently generates Pareto-optimal solutions. Simulations with real-world New Radio base station datasets demonstrate that MO-CMPO achieves superior hypervolume performance and significantly lower inference latency than baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis reveals practical deployment patterns: latency-oriented solutions favor local MEC execution to reduce transmission delay, while energy-oriented solutions minimize redundant placements to save energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submited to IEEE journal</p></details> |

Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights. Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN, a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong performance holds even with limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review in Frontiers in Bioinformatics</p></details> |

Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025), Main Track</p></details> |

This setting captures key characteristics of convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce a maximum-entropy approach to temporal networks and with basic assumptions on constraints, the corresponding network ensembles admit a modular and interpretable representation: a set of global time processes and a static maximum-entropy edge, e.g. node pair, probability. This time-edge labels factorization yields closed-form log-likelihoods, degree, clustering and motif expectations, and yields a whole class of effective generative models. We provide maximum-entropy derivation of an inhomogeneous Poisson edge intensity for temporal networks via functional optimization over path entropy, connecting NHPP modeling to maximum-entropy network ensembles. NHPP consistently improve log-likelihood over generic Poisson processes, while the maximum-entropy edge labels recover strength constraints and reproduce expected unique-degree curves. We discuss the limitations of this framework and how it can be integrated with multivariate Hawkes calibration procedures, renewal theory, and neural kernel estimation in graph neural networks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 25 figures |

Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems, while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced search requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages content. 2 pages references</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale High-Resolution Logarithmic Grapher Module for Efficient Vision GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13740v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN) and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy, GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3% reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of current state-of-the-art ViGs.

| **[Axial Neural Networks for Dimension-Free Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13665v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems. Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining for foundation models.</p></details> |  |

We adopt a task-oriented perspective to systematically review the applications and advancements of multimodal fusion methods and VLMs in the field of robot vision. For semantic scene understanding tasks, we categorize fusion approaches into encoder-decoder frameworks, attention-based architectures, and graph neural networks. Meanwhile, we also analyze the architectural characteristics and practical implementations of these fusion strategies in key tasks such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), 3D object detection, navigation, and manipulation. We compare the evolutionary paths and applicability of VLMs based on large language models (LLMs) with traditional multimodal fusion methods.Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of commonly used datasets, evaluating their applicability and challenges in real-world robotic scenarios. Building on this analysis, we identify key challenges in current research, including cross-modal alignment, efficient fusion, real-time deployment, and domain adaptation. We propose future directions such as self-supervised learning for robust multimodal representations, structured spatial memory and environment modeling to enhance spatial intelligence, and the integration of adversarial robustness and human feedback mechanisms to enable ethically aligned system deployment.

To optimize this process, existing works often employs message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to predict quality of results (QoR). These predictors serve as evaluators in the DSE process, effectively bypassing the time-consuming estimations traditionally required by HLS tools. However, existing models based on MPNNs struggle with over-smoothing and limited expressiveness. Additionally, while meta-heuristic algorithms are widely used in DSE, they typically require extensive domain-specific knowledge to design operators and time-consuming tuning. To address these limitations, we propose ECoGNNs-LLMMHs, a framework that integrates graph neural networks with task-adaptive message passing and large language model-enhanced meta-heuristic algorithms. Compared with state-of-the-art works, ECoGNN exhibits lower prediction error in the post-HLS prediction task, with the error reduced by 57.27\%. For post-implementation prediction tasks, ECoGNN demonstrates the lowest prediction errors, with average reductions of 17.6\% for flip-flop (FF) usage, 33.7\% for critical path (CP) delay, 26.3\% for power consumption, 38.3\% for digital signal processor (DSP) utilization, and 40.8\% for BRAM usage. LLMMH variants can generate superior Pareto fronts compared to meta-heuristic algorithms in terms of average distance from the reference set (ADRS) with average improvements of 87.47\%, respectively. Compared with the SOTA DSE approaches GNN-DSE and IRONMAN-PRO, LLMMH can reduce the ADRS by 68.17\% and 63.07\% respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Going with the Flow: Approximating Banzhaf Values via Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13391v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for quantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging from cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count (5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 11-page appendix</p></details> |

This paper presents novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art.

One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover, the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Are High-Degree Representations Really Unnecessary in Equivariant Graph Neural Networks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11443v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that incorporate E(3) symmetry have achieved significant success in various scientific applications. As one of the most successful models, EGNN leverages a simple scalarization technique to perform equivariant message passing over only Cartesian vectors (i.e., 1st-degree steerable vectors), enjoying greater efficiency and efficacy compared to equivariant GNNs using higher-degree steerable vectors. This success suggests that higher-degree representations might be unnecessary. In this paper, we disprove this hypothesis by exploring the expressivity of equivariant GNNs on symmetric structures, including $k$-fold rotations and regular polyhedra. We theoretically demonstrate that equivariant GNNs will always degenerate to a zero function if the degree of the output representations is fixed to 1 or other specific values. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose HEGNN, a high-degree version of EGNN to increase the expressivity by incorporating high-degree steerable vectors while maintaining EGNN's efficiency through the scalarization trick. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HEGNN not only aligns with our theoretical analyses on toy datasets consisting of symmetric structures, but also shows substantial improvements on more complicated datasets such as $N$-body and MD17. Our theoretical findings and empirical results potentially open up new possibilities for the research of equivariant GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universally Invariant Learning in Equivariant GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13169v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success across various applications. To achieve completeness -- that is, the universal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the network must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among different nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented body orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high computational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we present a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete equivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete equivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete scalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and 2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an efficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two common models: EGNN and TFN. Empirical results demonstrate that our model demonstrates superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few layers, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining strong practical efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-hoc Popularity Bias Correction in GNN-based Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12959v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User historical interaction data is the primary signal for learning user preferences in collaborative filtering (CF). However, the training data often exhibits a long-tailed distribution, where only a few items have the majority of interactions. CF models trained directly on such imbalanced data are prone to learning popularity bias, which reduces personalization and leads to suboptimal recommendation quality. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), while effective for CF due to their message passing mechanism, can further propagate and amplify popularity bias through their aggregation process. Existing approaches typically address popularity bias by modifying training objectives but fail to directly counteract the bias propagated during GNN's neighborhood aggregation. Applying weights to interactions during aggregation can help alleviate this problem, yet it risks distorting model learning due to unstable node representations in the early stages of training. In this paper, we propose a Post-hoc Popularity Debiasing (PPD) method that corrects for popularity bias in GNN-based CF and operates directly on pre-trained embeddings without requiring retraining. By estimating interaction-level popularity and removing popularity components from node representations via a popularity direction vector, PPD reduces bias while preserving user preferences. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for popularity bias correction in GNN-based CF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rademacher Meets Colors: More Expressivity, but at What Cost ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10101v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity -- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power often comes at the cost of generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Neurodegeneration with Brain Age Gap Prediction Models: A Graph Signal Processing Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12763v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neurodegeneration, characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal structure or function, is commonly assessed in clinical practice through reductions in cortical thickness or brain volume, as visualized by structural MRI. While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical sophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and heterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy aging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age gap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain age gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's predicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The resulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with recent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and severity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their methodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical populations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces a principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in graph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks (GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the anatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong theoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust estimation of brain age gap predictions. By integrating perspectives from GSP, machine learning, and network neuroscience, this work clarifies the path forward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research directions in personalized medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Signal Processing Magazine</p></details> |

A common remedy is to sparsify the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and versatility of our multi-view approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to TAG workshop</p></details> |

The general chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT) significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes. Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference in industrial drug discovery workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Exact Subgraph Matching via GNN-based Path Dominance Embedding (Technical Report)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15641v5)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classic problem of exact subgraph matching returns those subgraphs in a large-scale data graph that are isomorphic to a given query graph, which has gained increasing importance in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective graph neural network (GNN)-based path embedding framework (GNN-PE), which allows efficient exact subgraph matching without introducing false dismissals. Unlike traditional GNN-based graph embeddings that only produce approximate subgraph matching results, in this paper, we carefully devise GNN-based embeddings for paths, such that: if two paths (and 1-hop neighbors of vertices on them) have the subgraph relationship, their corresponding GNN-based embedding vectors will strictly follow the dominance relationship. With such a newly designed property of path dominance embeddings, we are able to propose effective pruning strategies based on path label/dominance embeddings and guarantee no false dismissals for subgraph matching. We build multidimensional indexes over path embedding vectors, and develop an efficient subgraph matching algorithm by traversing indexes over graph partitions in parallel and applying our pruning methods. We also propose a cost-model-based query plan that obtains query paths from the query graph with low query cost. To further optimize our GNN-PE approach, we also propose a more efficient GNN-based path group embedding (GNN-PGE) technique, which performs subgraph matching over grouped path embedding vectors. We design effective pruning strategies (w.r.t. grouped path embeddings) that can significantly reduce the search space during the index traversal. Through extensive experiments, we confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed GNN-PE and GNN-PGE approaches for exact subgraph matching on both real and synthetic graph data.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAMNet: Leveraging Cooperative Awareness Messages for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12703v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network, Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC) 2026 - Las Vegas, NV, USA 9 - 12 January 2026</p></details> |

Promotion abuse is one of the fastest-growing types of fraud in recent years and is characterized by users exploiting promotional activities to gain financial benefits from the platform. To investigate this issue, we conduct the first study on promotion abuse fraud in e-commerce platforms MEITUAN. We find that promotion abuse fraud is a group-based fraudulent activity with two types of fraudulent activities: Stocking Up and Cashback Abuse. Unlike traditional fraudulent activities such as fake reviews, promotion abuse fraud typically involves ordinary customers conducting legitimate transactions and these two types of fraudulent activities are often intertwined. To address this issue, we propose leveraging additional information from the spatial and temporal perspectives to detect promotion abuse fraud. In this paper, we introduce PROMOGUARDIAN, a novel multi-relation fused graph neural network that integrates the spatial and temporal information of transaction data into a homogeneous graph to detect promotion abuse fraud. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world data from MEITUAN, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in promotion abuse fraud detection, achieving 93.15% precision, detecting 2.1 to 5.0 times more fraudsters, and preventing 1.5 to 8.8 times more financial losses in production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The final version of this paper is going to appear in IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2026</p></details> |
| **[Computing Systemic Risk Measures with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07222v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates systemic risk measures for stochastic financial networks of explicitly modelled bilateral liabilities. We extend the notion of systemic risk measures from Biagini, Fouque, Fritelli and Meyer-Brandis (2019) to graph structured data. In particular, we focus on an aggregation function that is derived from a market clearing algorithm proposed by Eisenberg and Noe (2001). In this setting, we show the existence of an optimal random allocation that distributes the overall minimal bailout capital and secures the network. We study numerical methods for the approximation of systemic risk and optimal random allocations. We propose to use permutation equivariant architectures of neural networks like graph neural networks (GNNs) and a class that we name (extended) permutation equivariant neural networks ((X)PENNs). We compare their performance to several benchmark allocations. The main feature of GNNs and (X)PENNs is that they are permutation equivariant with respect to the underlying graph data. In numerical experiments we find evidence that these permutation equivariant methods are superior to other approaches.</p></details> | 50 pages |
| **[Enhanced Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks for Million-Scale Heterogeneous Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12401v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.

SpaPool groups vertices into an adaptive number of clusters, leveraging the benefits of both dense and sparse approaches. It aims to maintain the structural integrity of the graph while reducing its size efficiently. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SpaPool achieves competitive performance compared to existing pooling techniques and excels particularly on small-scale graphs. This makes SpaPool a promising method for applications requiring efficient and effective graph processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning through GNN-Derived Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12840v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance, resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate them against standard baselines, showing improvements in the scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.</p></details> |  |

We propose an end-to-end graph neural network (GNN) based neural operator to learn PDE solution operators from data on point clouds in arbitrary domains. Our multi-scale model maps data between input/output point clouds by passing it through a downsampled regional mesh. The approach includes novel elements aimed at ensuring spatio-temporal resolution invariance. Our model, termed RIGNO, is tested on a challenging suite of benchmarks composed of various time-dependent and steady PDEs defined on a diverse set of domains. We demonstrate that RIGNO is significantly more accurate than neural operator baselines and robustly generalizes to unseen resolutions both in space and in time. Our code is publicly available at github.com/camlab-ethz/rigno.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism, implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves original feature information through residual connections, which is critical for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint was submitted to IEEE TrustCom 2025.

By integrating large language models (LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs, offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and resources are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IMDGA-7289.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Despite extensive training and fine-tuning efforts aimed at enhancing safety, LLMs remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Recently, the emergence of multi-turn attacks has intensified this vulnerability. Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks incrementally escalate dialogue complexity, rendering them more challenging to detect and mitigate. In this study, we introduce G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based input classifier specifically designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks targeting LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, which captures the interrelationships between queries and harmful keywords that present in multi-turn queries. Furthermore, we propose an attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most relevant single-turn query based on the ongoing multi-turn conversation. The retrieved query is incorporated as a labeled node within the graph, thereby enhancing the GNN's capacity to classify the current query as harmful or benign. Evaluation results show that G-Guard consistently outperforms all baselines across diverse datasets and evaluation metrics, demonstrating its efficacy as a robust defense mechanism against multi-turn jailbreak attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, they often produce biased predictions caused by sensitive attributes, such as religion or gender, an issue that has been largely overlooked in existing methods. Recently, numerous studies have focused on reducing biases in GNNs. However, these approaches often rely on training with partial data (e.g., using either node features or graph structure alone), which can enhance fairness but frequently compromises model utility due to the limited utilization of available graph information. To address this tradeoff, we propose an effective strategy to balance fairness and utility in knowledge distillation. Specifically, we introduce FairDTD, a novel Fair representation learning framework built on Dual-Teacher Distillation, leveraging a causal graph model to guide and optimize the design of the distillation process. Specifically, FairDTD employs two fairness-oriented teacher models: a feature teacher and a structure teacher, to facilitate dual distillation, with the student model learning fairness knowledge from the teachers while also leveraging full data to mitigate utility loss. To enhance information transfer, we incorporate graph-level distillation to provide an indirect supplement of graph information during training, as well as a node-specific temperature module to improve the comprehensive transfer of fair knowledge. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairDTD achieves optimal fairness while preserving high model utility, showcasing its effectiveness in fair representation learning for GNNs.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional uncertainty estimation, graph-based uncertainty must account for randomness arising from both the graph's structure and its label distribution, which adds complexity. In this paper, making an analogy between the evolution of a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by Matern Gaussian Process and message passing using GNN layers, we present a principled way to design a novel message passing scheme that incorporates spatial-temporal noises motivated by the Gaussian Process approach to SPDE. Our method simultaneously captures uncertainty across space and time and allows explicit control over the covariance kernel smoothness, thereby enhancing uncertainty estimates on graphs with both low and high label informativeness. Our extensive experiments on Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection on graph datasets with varying label informativeness demonstrate the soundness and superiority of our model to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

As such, NAD is a critical task with several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the original features and structural features derived from random walks and degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.</p></details> |  |

| **[Query-Specific GNN: A Comprehensive Graph Representation Learning Method for Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11541v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources. However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network (QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at: https://github.com/Jerry2398/QSGNN.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a GNN that is interpretable by design. Our model, Graph Neural Additive Network (GNAN), is a novel extension of the interpretable class of Generalized Additive Models, and can be visualized and fully understood by humans. GNAN is designed to be fully interpretable, offering both global and local explanations at the feature and graph levels through direct visualization of the model. These visualizations describe exactly how the model uses the relationships between the target variable, the features, and the graph. We demonstrate the intelligibility of GNANs in a series of examples on different tasks and datasets. In addition, we show that the accuracy of GNAN is on par with black-box GNNs, making it suitable for critical applications where transparency is essential, alongside high accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-View Graph Feature Propagation for Privacy Preservation and Feature Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11347v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks. Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each propagating information independently through the graph topology. The aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Event-Aware Prompt Learning for Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11339v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks. Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.</p></details> | Under review |

We address this by proposing, to our knowledge, the first-ever SDEN (Software Defined Energy Network) for CaaS (Computations-as-a-Service) that unifies edge, fog, and cloud compute with 5G URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications), SDN (Software Defined Networking), and NFV (Network Functions Virtualization) to co-optimize energy, latency, and reliability end-to-end. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a joint task offloading formulation that couples computation placement with network capacity under explicit URLLC constraints; (ii) a feasibility preserving, lightweight greedy heuristic that scales while closely tracking optimal energy and latency trade-offs; and (iii) a tiered AI (Artificial Intelligence) pipeline-reactive at the edge, predictive in the fog, strategic in the cloud-featuring privacy-preserving, federated GNNs (Graph Neural Networks) for fault detection and microgrid coordination. Unlike prior edge-only or cloud-only schemes, SDEN turns fragmented grid compute into a single, programmable substrate that delivers dependable, energy-aware, real time analytics establishing a first-ever, software defined path to practical, grid-scale CaaS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enforcing convex constraints in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11227v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many machine learning applications require outputs that satisfy complex, dynamic constraints. This task is particularly challenging in Graph Neural Network models due to the variable output sizes of graph-structured data. In this paper, we introduce ProjNet, a Graph Neural Network framework which satisfies input-dependant constraints. ProjNet combines a sparse vector clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, an iterative scheme for solving the best-approximation problem. We establish a convergence result for CAD and develop a GPU-accelerated implementation capable of handling large-scale inputs efficiently. To enable end-to-end training, we introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD that is both computationally efficient and better suited for optimization than the exact gradient. We validate ProjNet on four classes of constrained optimisation problems: linear programming, two classes of non-convex quadratic programs, and radio transmit power optimization, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse problem settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06743v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning. Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through a flexible spectral-domain parameterization. This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: New Perspectives in Advancing Graph Machine Learning</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Network-Based Multicast Routing for On-Demand Streaming Services in 6G Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11109v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increase of bandwidth-intensive applications in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, such as real-time volumetric streaming and multi-sensory extended reality, demands intelligent multicast routing solutions capable of delivering differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) at scale. Traditional shortest-path and multicast routing algorithms are either computationally prohibitive or structurally rigid, and they often fail to support heterogeneous user demands, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. Neural network-based approaches, while offering improved inference speed, typically lack topological generalization and scalability. To address these limitations, this paper presents a graph neural network (GNN)-based multicast routing framework that jointly minimizes total transmission cost and supports user-specific video quality requirements. The routing problem is formulated as a constrained minimum-flow optimization task, and a reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to sequentially construct efficient multicast trees by reusing paths and adapting to network dynamics. A graph attention network (GAT) is employed as the encoder to extract context-aware node embeddings, while a long short-term memory (LSTM) module models the sequential dependencies in routing decisions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method closely approximates optimal dynamic programming-based solutions while significantly reducing computational complexity. The results also confirm strong generalization to large-scale and dynamic network topologies, highlighting the method's potential for real-time deployment in 6G multimedia delivery scenarios.

| **[Revisiting Node Affinity Prediction in Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06940v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS - Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising, training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics. Our source code is available at https://github.com/orfeld415/NAVIS</p></details> | preprint |

A significant challenge in this domain is the generalizability of preference models, particularly their efficacy in predicting preferences within environmental configurations not encountered during training. While deep learning models have shown promise in learning complex spatial and contextual dependencies, it remains unclear which neural network architectures are most effective at generalizing to unseen layouts. To address this, we conduct a comparative study of Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and standard feedforward Neural Networks using synthetic data generated from a simplified and synthetic pocket park environment. Beginning with this illustrative case study, allows for controlled analysis of each model's ability to transfer learned preference patterns to unseen spatial scenarios. The models are evaluated based on their capacity to predict preferences influenced by heterogeneous physical, environmental, and social features. Generalizability score is calculated using the area under the precision-recall curve for the seen and unseen layouts. This generalizability score is appropriate for imbalanced data, providing insights into the suitability of each neural network architecture for preference-aware human behavior modeling in unseen built environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 15th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (IWSHM)</p></details> |

Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.</p></details> |  |

A novel approach that combines game-theoretic control theory with Graph Neural Networks is introduced in this work. By conceptualizing pursuer configurations as strategic arrangements and representing them as graphs, a Graph Characteristic Space is constructed via multi-objective optimization to identify Pareto-optimal configurations. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained on these Pareto-optimal graphs to generate strategically effective initial configurations, termed "hot starts". Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the GCN-generated hot starts provide a significant advantage over random configurations. In scenarios considering multiple pursuers and evaders, this method hastens the decline in evader survival rates, reduces pursuer travel distances, and enhances containment, showcasing clear strategic benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at AAMAS Workshop on Autonomous Robots and Multirobot Systems (ARMS)</p></details> |

Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing. Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.</p></details> |  |

With their growing adoption in engineering design evaluation, a wide range of neural operator architectures have been proposed for various problem settings. However, model selection remains challenging due to the absence of fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address this, we propose and standardize six representative 3D industry-scale engineering design datasets spanning thermal analysis, linear elasticity, elasto-plasticity, time-dependent plastic problems, and computational fluid dynamics. All datasets include fully preprocessed inputs and outputs for model training, making them directly usable across diverse neural operator architectures. Using these datasets, we conduct a systematic comparison of four types of neural operator variants, including Branch-Trunk-based Neural Operators inspired by DeepONet, Graph-based Neural Operators inspired by Graph Neural Networks, Grid-based Neural Operators inspired by Fourier Neural Operators, and Point-based Neural Operators inspired by PointNet. We further introduce practical enhancements to adapt these models to different engineering settings, improving the fairness of the comparison. Our benchmarking study evaluates each model strengths and limitations in terms of predictive performance, computational efficiency, memory usage, and deployment complexity. The findings provide actionable insights to guide future neural operator development.</p></details> |  |

Structure-based pre-training methods are under-explored yet crucial for downstream applications which rely on underlying graph structure. In addition, pre-training traditional message passing GNNs to capture global and regional structure is often challenging due to the risk of oversmoothing as network depth increases. We address these gaps by proposing the Laplacian Eigenvector Learning Module (LELM), a novel pre-training module for graph neural networks (GNNs) based on predicting the low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Moreover, LELM introduces a novel architecture that overcomes oversmoothing, allowing the GNN model to learn long-range interdependencies. Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform baseline models on downstream molecular property prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

This study conducts a comprehensive scientometric analysis of research on data-driven pedestrian trajectory prediction and crowd simulation, mapping its intellectual evolution and interdisciplinary structure. Using bibliometric data from the Web of Science Core Collection, we employ SciExplorer and Bibliometrix to identify major trends, influential contributors, and emerging frontiers. Results reveal a strong convergence between artificial intelligence, urban informatics, and crowd behavior modeling--driven by graph neural networks, transformers, and generative models. Beyond technical advances, the field increasingly informs urban mobility design, public safety planning, and digital twin development for smart cities. However, challenges remain in ensuring interpretability, inclusivity, and cross-domain transferability. By connecting methodological trajectories with urban applications, this work highlights how data-driven approaches can enrich urban governance and pave the way for adaptive, socially responsible mobility intelligence in future cities.</p></details> | 5 figures |

In this work, we propose S$^2$G-Net, a novel neural architecture that unifies state-space sequence modeling with multi-view Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for ICU LOS prediction. The temporal path employs Mamba state-space models (SSMs) to capture patient trajectories, while the graph path leverages an optimized GraphGPS backbone, designed to integrate heterogeneous patient similarity graphs derived from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic features. Experiments on the large-scale MIMIC-IV cohort dataset show that S$^2$G-Net consistently outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba, Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches across all primary metrics. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability analyses highlight the complementary contributions of each component of our architecture and underscore the importance of principled graph construction. These results demonstrate that S$^2$G-Net provides an effective and scalable solution for ICU LOS prediction with multi-modal clinical data.

Moreover, the complex and diverse local topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge. Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD) framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The model is built on graph neural networks and incorporates a multi-hop neighbor aggregation strategy. By integrating the structural information of knowledge graphs and dynamically assigning importance to different neighbors through an attention mechanism, the model enhances its ability to capture implicit preference relationships. In the proposed method, users and items are embedded into a unified graph structure. Multi-level semantic paths are constructed based on entities and relations in the knowledge graph to extract richer contextual information. During the rating prediction phase, recommendations are generated through the interaction between user and target item representations. The model is optimized using a binary cross-entropy loss function. Experiments conducted on the Amazon Books dataset validate the superior performance of the proposed model across various evaluation metrics. The model also shows good convergence and stability. These results further demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of structure-aware attention mechanisms in knowledge graph-enhanced recommendation.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose \textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters, identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.</p></details> |  |

However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Joint Embeddings of Function and Process Call Graphs for Malware Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09984v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation. While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318 malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods face two fundamental challenges: the limited reasoning capacity of single-agent systems and the complexity of designing effective multi-agent architectures, as well as contextual overload that hinders accurate decision-making. We introduce Nutritional-Graph Router (NG-Router), a novel framework that formulates nutritional QA as a supervised, knowledge-graph-guided multi-agent collaboration problem. NG-Router integrates agent nodes into heterogeneous knowledge graphs and employs a graph neural network to learn task-aware routing distributions over agents, leveraging soft supervision derived from empirical agent performance. To further address contextual overload, we propose a gradient-based subgraph retrieval mechanism that identifies salient evidence during training, thereby enhancing multi-hop and relational reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbone models demonstrate that NG-Router consistently outperforms both single-agent and ensemble baselines, offering a principled approach to domain-aware multi-agent reasoning for complex nutritional health tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.</p></details> |  |

However, time-critical decisions in a dynamical environment limit the time available to gather supporting evidence. We address this bottleneck by developing a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate of a spatially and demographically resolved mechanistic metapopulation simulator. This combined approach advances classical machine learning approaches which are often black box. Our design of experiments spans outbreak and persistent-threat regimes, up to three contact change points, and age-structured contact matrices on a 400-node spatial graph. We benchmark multiple GNN layers and identify an ARMAConv-based architecture that offers a strong accuracy-runtime trade-off. Across 30-90 day horizons and up to three contact change points, the surrogate attains 10-27 % mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) while delivering (near) constant runtime with respect to the forecast horizon. Our approach accelerates evaluation by up to 28,670 times compared with the mechanistic model, allowing responsive decision support in time-critical scenarios and straightforward web integration. These results show how GNN surrogates can translate complex metapopulation models into immediate, reliable tools for pandemic response.</p></details> | 29 pages, 7 figures |

However,existing physics-based and data-driven models often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data. We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37 years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States, Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental monitoring and decision-making.</p></details> |  |

We build on previous work that successfully designed site-specific precoders based on a combination of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). In this paper, by utilizing a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we circumvent one of the key drawbacks of GMMs, i.e., the number of GMM components scales exponentially to the feedback bits. In addition, the deep learning architecture of the VQ-VAE allows us to jointly train the GNN together with VQ-VAE along with pilot optimization forming an end-to-end (E2E) model, resulting in considerable performance gains in sum rate for multi-user wireless systems. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed frameworks over the conventional methods involving the sub-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) pilot matrix and iterative precoder algorithms enabling the deployment of systems characterized by fewer pilots or feedback bits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[A Multimodal Approach to SME Credit Scoring Integrating Transaction and Ownership Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09407v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are known to play a vital role in economic growth, employment, and innovation. However, they tend to face significant challenges in accessing credit due to limited financial histories, collateral constraints, and exposure to macroeconomic shocks. These challenges make an accurate credit risk assessment by lenders crucial, particularly since SMEs frequently operate within interconnected firm networks through which default risk can propagate. This paper presents and tests a novel approach for modelling the risk of SME credit, using a unique large data set of SME loans provided by a prominent financial institution. Specifically, our approach employs Graph Neural Networks to predict SME default using multilayer network data derived from common ownership and financial transactions between firms. We show that combining this information with traditional structured data not only improves application scoring performance, but also explicitly models contagion risk between companies. Further analysis shows how the directionality and intensity of these connections influence financial risk contagion, offering a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. Our findings highlight the predictive power of network data, as well as the role of supply chain networks in exposing SMEs to correlated default risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey of Mamba Architectures for Medical Image Analysis: Classification, Segmentation, Restoration and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02362v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a special case of the State Space Model, is gaining popularity as an alternative to template-based deep learning approaches in medical image analysis. While transformers are powerful architectures, they have drawbacks, including quadratic computational complexity and an inability to address long-range dependencies efficiently. This limitation affects the analysis of large and complex datasets in medical imaging, where there are many spatial and temporal relationships. In contrast, Mamba offers benefits that make it well-suited for medical image analysis. It has linear time complexity, which is a significant improvement over transformers. Mamba processes longer sequences without attention mechanisms, enabling faster inference and requiring less memory. Mamba also demonstrates strong performance in merging multimodal data, improving diagnosis accuracy and patient outcomes. The organization of this paper allows readers to appreciate the capabilities of Mamba in medical imaging step by step. We begin by defining core concepts of SSMs and models, including S4, S5, and S6, followed by an exploration of Mamba architectures such as pure Mamba, U-Net variants, and hybrid models with convolutional neural networks, transformers, and Graph Neural Networks. We also cover Mamba optimizations, techniques and adaptations, scanning, datasets, applications, experimental results, and conclude with its challenges and future directions in medical imaging. This review aims to demonstrate the transformative potential of Mamba in overcoming existing barriers within medical imaging while paving the way for innovative advancements in the field. A comprehensive list of Mamba architectures applied in the medical field, reviewed in this work, is available at Github.</p></details> |  |

Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live, interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live, explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events (arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial advantage for a reliable decision support tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGSPATIAL 2025 - GeoAI Workshop</p></details> |

The prevailing paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn, adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors, enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[When LLM Agents Meet Graph Optimization: An Automated Data Quality Improvement Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08952v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7figures |

We investigate the Set Cover Problem (SCP) and propose Graph-SCP, a graph neural network method that augments existing optimization solvers by learning to identify a smaller sub-problem that contains the solution space. Graph-SCP uses both supervised learning from prior solved instances and unsupervised learning to minimize the SCP objective. We evaluate the performance of Graph-SCP on synthetically weighted and unweighted SCP instances with diverse problem characteristics and complexities, and on instances from the OR Library, a canonical benchmark for SCP. We show that Graph-SCP reduces the problem size by 60-80% and achieves runtime speedups of up to 10x on average when compared to Gurobi (a state-of-the-art commercial solver), while maintaining solution quality. This is in contrast to fast greedy solutions that significantly compromise solution quality to achieve guaranteed polynomial runtime. We showcase Graph-SCP's ability to generalize to larger problem sizes, training on SCP instances with up to 3,000 subsets and testing on SCP instances with up to 10,000 subsets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Graph Condensation via Gaussian Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02565v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph condensation reduces the size of large graphs while preserving performance, addressing the scalability challenges of Graph Neural Networks caused by computational inefficiencies on large datasets. Existing methods often rely on bi-level optimization, requiring extensive GNN training and limiting their scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes Graph Condensation via Gaussian Process (GCGP), a novel and computationally efficient approach to graph condensation. GCGP utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP), with the condensed graph serving as observations, to estimate the posterior distribution of predictions. This approach eliminates the need for the iterative and resource-intensive training typically required by GNNs. To enhance the capability of the GCGP in capturing dependencies between function values, we derive a specialized covariance function that incorporates structural information. This covariance function broadens the receptive field of input nodes by local neighborhood aggregation, thereby facilitating the representation of intricate dependencies within the nodes. To address the challenge of optimizing binary structural information in condensed graphs, Concrete random variables are utilized to approximate the binary adjacency matrix in a continuous counterpart. This relaxation process allows the adjacency matrix to be represented in a differentiable form, enabling the application of gradient-based optimization techniques to discrete graph structures. Experimental results show that the proposed GCGP method efficiently condenses large-scale graph data while preserving predictive performance, addressing the scalability and efficiency challenges. The implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WANGLin0126/GCGP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fair Graph Machine Learning under Adversarial Missingness Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01591v4)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in many relevant tasks where decisions might disproportionately impact specific communities. However, existing work on fair GNNs often assumes that either sensitive attributes are fully observed or they are missing completely at random. We show that an adversarial missingness process can inadvertently disguise a fair model through the imputation, leading the model to overestimate the fairness of its predictions. We address this challenge by proposing Better Fair than Sorry (BFtS), a fair missing data imputation model for sensitive attributes. The key principle behind BFtS is that imputations should approximate the worst-case scenario for fairness -- i.e. when optimizing fairness is the hardest. We implement this idea using a 3-player adversarial scheme where two adversaries collaborate against a GNN classifier, and the classifier minimizes the maximum bias. Experiments using synthetic and real datasets show that BFtS often achieves a better fairness x accuracy trade-off than existing alternatives under an adversarial missingness process.</p></details> |  |

While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity. Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 22 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Interpreting GNN-based IDS Detections Using Provenance Graph Structural Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00934v7)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced cyber threats (e.g., Fileless Malware and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)) have driven the adoption of provenance-based security solutions. These solutions employ Machine Learning (ML) models for behavioral modeling and critical security tasks such as malware and anomaly detection. However, the opacity of ML-based security models limits their broader adoption, as the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes restricts explainability and verifiability. We tailored our solution towards Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based security solutions since recent studies employ GNNs to comprehensively digest system provenance graphs for security-critical tasks. To enhance the explainability of GNN-based security models, we introduce PROVEXPLAINER, a framework offering instance-level security-aware explanations using an interpretable surrogate model. PROVEXPLAINER's interpretable feature space consists of discriminant subgraph patterns and graph structural features, which can be directly mapped to the system provenance problem space, making the explanations human interpretable. We show how PROVEXPLAINER synergizes with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN explainers to deliver domain and instance-specific explanations. We measure the explanation quality using the Fidelity+/Fidelity- metric as used by traditional GNN explanation literature, we incorporate the precision/recall metric, where we consider the accuracy of the explanation against the ground truth, and we designed a human actionability metric based on graph traversal distance. On real-world Fileless and APT datasets, PROVEXPLAINER achieves up to 29%/27%/25%/1.4x higher Fidelity+, precision, recall, and actionability (where higher values are better), and 12% lower Fidelity- (where lower values are better) when compared against SOTA GNN explainers.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneForecast: A Universal Framework for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00338v4)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate weather forecasts are important for disaster prevention, agricultural planning, etc. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods offer physically interpretable high-accuracy predictions but are computationally expensive and fail to fully leverage rapidly growing historical data. In recent years, deep learning models have made significant progress in weather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event predictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework (OneForecast) based on graph neural networks. By combining a dynamic system perspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure and densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We introduce an adaptive messaging mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply integrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting. For high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method to mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that OneForecast performs excellently across global to regional scales and short-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.

On the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network, GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data for Human Pose Estimation.

These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.</p></details> |  |

However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI) between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures. Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442 substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112), and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) Predictive Intelligence in Medicine Workshop (MICCAI PRIME) 2025; 13 pages</p></details> |

This assumption does not hold in many real-world heterophilic graphs. Existing models for heterophilic graphs primarily rely on pairwise relationships, overlooking multi-scale information from higher-order structures. This leads to suboptimal performance, particularly under noise from conflicting class information across nodes. To address these challenges, we propose HPGNN, a novel model integrating Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks. HPGNN introduces an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture long-range and multi-scale node interactions. This approach reduces computational complexity and mitigates noise from surrounding information. By embedding higher-order structural information into convolutional networks, HPGNN effectively models key interactions across diverse graph dimensions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate HPGNN's effectiveness. The model achieves better performance than five out of seven state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs in downstream tasks while maintaining competitive performance on homophilic graphs. HPGNN's ability to balance multi-scale information and robustness to noise makes it a versatile solution for real-world graph learning challenges.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD), incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size, mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ARRML2025</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches assume homogeneous client models and largely overlook the challenge of model-centric heterogeneous FGL (MHtFGL), which frequently arises in practice when organizations employ graph neural networks (GNNs) of different scales and architectures.Such architectural diversity not only undermines smooth server-side aggregation, which presupposes a unified representation space shared across clients' updates, but also further complicates the transfer and integration of structural knowledge across clients. To address this issue, we propose the Federated Graph Knowledge Collaboration (FedGKC) framework. FedGKC introduces a lightweight Copilot Model on each client to facilitate knowledge exchange while local architectures are heterogeneous across clients, and employs two complementary mechanisms: Client-side Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation, which transfers effective knowledge between local and copilot models through bidirectional distillation with multi-view perturbation; and Server-side Knowledge-Aware Model Aggregation, which dynamically assigns aggregation weights based on knowledge provided by clients. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedGKC achieves an average accuracy gain of 3.74% over baselines in MHtFGL scenarios, while maintaining excellent performance in homogeneous settings.</p></details> |  |

DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves, it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering, sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified DGTEN framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown strong performance for this problem, but costly graph construction, irregular computations, and random memory access patterns substantially limit their throughput. The recently proposed Hashing-based Efficient Point Transformer (HEPT) offers a theoretically guaranteed near-linear complexity for large point cloud processing via locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) in attention computations; however, its evaluations have largely focused on embedding quality, and the object condensation pipeline on which HEPT relies requires a post-hoc clustering step (e.g., DBScan) that can dominate runtime. In this work, we make two contributions. First, we present a unified, fair evaluation of physics tracking performance for HEPT and a representative GNN-based pipeline under the same dataset and metrics. Second, we introduce HEPTv2 by extending HEPT with a lightweight decoder that eliminates the clustering stage and directly predicts track assignments. This modification preserves HEPT's regular, hardware-friendly computations while enabling ultra-fast end-to-end inference. On the TrackML dataset, optimized HEPTv2 achieves approximately 28 ms per event on an A100 while maintaining competitive tracking efficiency. These results position HEPTv2 as a practical, scalable alternative to GNN-based pipelines for fast tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop</p></details> |

While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+ achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA (3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICTAI 2025.

| **[AMBER: Adaptive Mesh Generation by Iterative Mesh Resolution Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23663v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cost and accuracy of simulating complex physical systems using the Finite Element Method (FEM) scales with the resolution of the underlying mesh. Adaptive meshes improve computational efficiency by refining resolution in critical regions, but typically require task-specific heuristics or cumbersome manual design by a human expert. We propose Adaptive Meshing By Expert Reconstruction (AMBER), a supervised learning approach to mesh adaptation. Starting from a coarse mesh, AMBER iteratively predicts the sizing field, i.e., a function mapping from the geometry to the local element size of the target mesh, and uses this prediction to produce a new intermediate mesh using an out-of-the-box mesh generator. This process is enabled through a hierarchical graph neural network, and relies on data augmentation by automatically projecting expert labels onto AMBER-generated data during training. We evaluate AMBER on 2D and 3D datasets, including classical physics problems, mechanical components, and real-world industrial designs with human expert meshes. AMBER generalizes to unseen geometries and consistently outperforms multiple recent baselines, including ones using Graph and Convolutional Neural Networks, and Reinforcement Learning-based approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS2025</p></details> |
| **[GNN-enhanced Traffic Anomaly Detection for Next-Generation SDN-Enabled Consumer Electronics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07109v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consumer electronics (CE) connected to the Internet of Things are susceptible to various attacks, including DDoS and web-based threats, which can compromise their functionality and facilitate remote hijacking. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to exploit CE for broader system attacks while enabling the propagation of malicious code across the CE network, resulting in device failures. Existing deep learning-based traffic anomaly detection systems exhibit high accuracy in traditional network environments but are often overly complex and reliant on static infrastructure, necessitating manual configuration and management. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable network model that integrates Software-defined Networking (SDN) and Compute First Networking (CFN) for next-generation CE networks. In this network model, we propose a Graph Neural Networks-based Network Anomaly Detection framework (GNN-NAD) that integrates SDN-based CE networks and enables the CFN architecture. GNN-NAD uniquely fuses a static, vulnerability-aware attack graph with dynamic traffic features, providing a holistic view of network security. The core of the framework is a GNN model (GSAGE) for graph representation learning, followed by a Random Forest (RF) classifier. This design (GSAGE+RF) demonstrates superior performance compared to existing feature selection methods. Experimental evaluations on CE environment reveal that GNN-NAD achieves superior metrics in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score, even with small sample sizes, exceeding the performance of current network anomaly detection methods. This work advances the security and efficiency of next-generation intelligent CE networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics. 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Graph Condensation: Advancing Data Versatility through Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17063v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing computation of training graph neural networks (GNNs) on large-scale graphs, graph condensation (GC) has emerged as a promising solution to synthesize a compact, substitute graph of the large-scale original graph for efficient GNN training. However, existing GC methods predominantly employ classification as the surrogate task for optimization, thus excessively relying on node labels and constraining their utility in label-sparsity scenarios. More critically, this surrogate task tends to overfit class-specific information within the condensed graph, consequently restricting the generalization capabilities of GC for other downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce Contrastive Graph Condensation (CTGC), which adopts a self-supervised surrogate task to extract critical, causal information from the original graph and enhance the cross-task generalizability of the condensed graph. Specifically, CTGC employs a dual-branch framework to disentangle the generation of the node attributes and graph structures, where a dedicated structural branch is designed to explicitly encode geometric information through nodes' positional embeddings. By implementing an alternating optimization scheme with contrastive loss terms, CTGC promotes the mutual enhancement of both branches and facilitates high-quality graph generation through the model inversion technique. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CTGC excels in handling various downstream tasks with a limited number of labels, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art GC methods.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |
| **[NAR-*ICP: Neural Execution of Classical ICP-based Pointcloud Registration Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11031v3)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the intersection of neural networks and classical robotics algorithms through the Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) blueprint, enabling the training of neural networks to reason like classical robotics algorithms by learning to execute them. Algorithms are integral to robotics and safety-critical applications due to their predictable and consistent performance through logical and mathematical principles. In contrast, while neural networks are highly adaptable, handling complex, high-dimensional data and generalising across tasks, they often lack interpretability and transparency in their internal computations. To bridge the two, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, NAR-*ICP, that learns the intermediate computations of classical ICP-based registration algorithms, extending the CLRS Benchmark. We evaluate our approach across real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating its flexibility in handling complex inputs, and its potential to be used within larger learning pipelines. Our method achieves superior performance compared to the baselines, even surpassing the algorithms it was trained on, further demonstrating its ability to generalise beyond the capabilities of traditional algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 16 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce MoRE-GNN (Multi-omics Relational Edge Graph Neural Network), a heterogeneous graph autoencoder that combines graph convolution and attention mechanisms to dynamically construct relational graphs directly from data. Evaluations on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that MoRE-GNN captures biologically meaningful relationships and outperforms existing methods, particularly in settings with strong inter-modality correlations. Furthermore, the learned representations allow for accurate downstream cross-modal predictions. While performance may vary with dataset complexity, MoRE-GNN offers an adaptive, scalable and interpretable framework for advancing multi-omics integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalization of Graph Neural Networks for AC Optimal Power Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06860v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) is computationally expensive for large-scale power systems, with conventional solvers requiring prohibitive solution times. Machine learning approaches offer computational speedups but struggle with scalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining. To enable scalability across grid sizes and adaptability to topology changes, we propose a Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN). HH-MPNN models buses, generators, loads, shunts, transmission lines and transformers as distinct node or edge types, combined with a scalable transformer model for handling long-range dependencies. On grids from 14 to 2,000 buses, HH-MPNN achieves less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies. Applied zero-shot to thousands of unseen topologies, HH-MPNN achieves less than 3% optimality gap despite training only on default topologies. Pre-training on smaller grids also improves results on a larger grid. Computational speedups reach 1,000x to 10,000x compared to interior point solvers. These results advance practical, generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print has been submitted for review</p></details> |
| **[GMLM: Bridging Graph Neural Networks and Language Models for Heterophilic Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05763v6)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) remains a central challenge in text-rich heterophilic graph learning. We propose a novel integration framework that enables effective fusion between powerful pre-trained text encoders and Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs). Our method enhances the alignment of textual and structural representations through a bidirectional fusion mechanism and contrastive node-level optimization. To evaluate the approach, we train two variants using different PLMs: Snowflake-Embed (state-of-the-art) and GTE-base, each paired with an R-GCN backbone. Experiments on five heterophilic benchmarks demonstrate that our integration method achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, surpassing existing GNN and large language model-based approaches. Notably, Snowflake-Embed + R-GCN improves accuracy on the Texas dataset by over 8\% and on Wisconsin by nearly 5\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our fusion strategy for advancing text-rich graph representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-Aware Compound-Protein Affinity Prediction via Graph Neural Network with Group Lasso Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03318v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end explainable models for structure-activity relationship (SAR) modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as the limited number of compound-protein interaction activity data for specific protein targets, and plenty of subtle changes in molecular configuration sites significantly affecting molecular properties. We exploit pairs of molecules with activity cliffs that share scaffolds but differ at substituent sites, characterized by large potency differences for specific protein targets. We propose a framework by implementing graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage property and structure information from activity cliff pairs to predict compound-protein affinity (i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). To enhance model performance and explainability, we train GNNs with structure-aware loss functions using group lasso and sparse group lasso regularizations, which prune and highlight molecular subgraphs relevant to activity differences. We applied this framework to activity cliff data of molecules targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (PDB IDs: 1O42, 2H8H, 4MXO). Our approach improved property prediction by integrating common and uncommon node information with sparse group lasso, as reflected in reduced root mean squared error (RMSE) and improved Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC). Applying regularizations also enhances feature attribution for GNN by boosting graph-level global direction scores and improving atom-level coloring accuracy. These advances strengthen model interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly for identifying critical molecular substructures in lead optimization.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Spatiotemporal Graph Learning with Direct Volumetric Information Passing and Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18013v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven learning of physical systems has kindled significant attention, where many neural models have been developed. In particular, mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in modeling spatiotemporal dynamics across arbitrary geometric domains. However, the existing node-edge message-passing and aggregation mechanism in GNNs limits the representation learning ability. In this paper, we proposed a dual-module framework, Cell-embedded and Feature-enhanced Graph Neural Network (aka, CeFeGNN), for learning spatiotemporal dynamics. Specifically, we embed learnable cell attributions to the common node-edge message passing process, which better captures the spatial dependency of regional features. Such a strategy essentially upgrades the local aggregation scheme from first order (e.g., from edge to node) to a higher order (e.g., from volume and edge to node), which takes advantage of volumetric information in message passing. Meanwhile, a novel feature-enhanced block is designed to further improve the model's performance and alleviate the over-smoothness problem. Extensive experiments on various PDE systems and one real-world dataset demonstrate that CeFeGNN achieves superior performance compared with other baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing the Effect of Embedding Norms and Singular Values to Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06066v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the factors that contribute to the effect of oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, our analysis is based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify the extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e., adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold start" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size (i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds. This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of the GNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI via RST-Enhanced Graph Fusion and Interpretability Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12324v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a fundamental task in natural language processing. While NLI has developed many sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm: CDCL-NLI, which extends traditional NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 25,410 instances and spanning 26 languages. To address the limitations of previous methods on CDCL-NLI task, we further propose an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion with interpretability-aware prediction. Our approach leverages RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) within heterogeneous graph neural networks for cross-document context modeling, and employs a structure-aware semantic alignment based on lexical chains for cross-lingual understanding. For NLI interpretability, we develop an EDU (Elementary Discourse Unit)-level attribution framework that produces extractive explanations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's superior performance, achieving significant improvements over both conventional NLI models as well as large language models. Our work sheds light on the study of NLI and will bring research interest on cross-document cross-lingual context understanding, hallucination elimination and interpretability inference. Our code and datasets are available at "https://github.com/Leonardo123-ui/CDCL_NLI" for peer review.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main (Camera Ready)</p></details> |
