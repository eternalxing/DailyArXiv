| **[Drone Swarm Energy Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11557v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This note presents an analytical framework for decision-making in drone swarm systems operating under uncertainty, based on the integration of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning. The proposed approach enables adaptive control and cooperative behavior of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within a cognitive AI platform, where each agent learns optimal energy management and navigation policies from dynamic environmental states. We extend the standard DDPG architecture with a belief-state representation derived from Bayesian filtering, allowing for robust decision-making in partially observable environments. In this paper, for the Gaussian case, we numerically compare the performance of policies derived from DDPG to optimal policies for discretized versions of the original continuous problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the POMDP-DDPG-based swarm control model significantly improves mission success rates and energy efficiency compared to baseline methods. The developed framework supports distributed learning and decision coordination across multiple agents, providing a foundation for scalable cognitive swarm autonomy. The outcomes of this research contribute to the advancement of energy-aware control algorithms for intelligent multi-agent systems and can be applied in security, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure inspection scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 Tables, 2 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Aligning Machiavellian Agents: Behavior Steering via Test-Time Policy Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11551v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 AI Alignment Track</p></details> |
| **[LDC: Learning to Generate Research Idea with Dynamic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14626v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in automating the scientific research ideation. Existing approaches primarily focus on prompting techniques, often producing ideas misaligned with expert standards - novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness, which are widely recognized by the research community as the three key subdimensions of high-quality ideas. Also, balancing these dimensions remains challenging due to their inherent trade-offs. To address these limitations, we propose the first framework that employs a two-stage approach combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and controllable Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the task. In the SFT stage, the model learns foundational patterns from pairs of research papers and their corresponding follow-up ideas. In the RL stage, multi-dimensional reward models guided by fine-grained feedback evaluate and optimize the model across key dimensions. During inference, dimensional controllers coordinated by a sentence-level decoder enable dynamic context-aware steering of the idea generation process. Our framework provides a balanced approach to research idea generation, achieving high-quality outcomes in the experiment by dynamically navigating the trade-offs among novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiAReL: Reinforcement Learning with Disturbance Awareness for Robust Sim2Real Policy Transfer in Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09010v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delayed Markov decision processes (DMDPs) fulfill the Markov property by augmenting the state space of agents with a finite time window of recently committed actions. In reliance on these state augmentations, delay-resolved reinforcement learning algorithms train policies to learn optimal interactions with environments featuring observation or action delays. Although such methods can be directly trained on the real robots, due to sample inefficiency, limited resources, or safety constraints, a common approach is to transfer models trained in simulation to the physical robot. However, robotic simulations rely on approximated models of the physical systems, which hinders the sim2real transfer. In this work, we consider various uncertainties in modeling the robot or environment dynamics as unknown intrinsic disturbances applied to the system input. We introduce the disturbance-augmented Markov decision process (DAMDP) in delayed settings as a novel representation to incorporate disturbance estimation in training on-policy reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed method is validated across several metrics on learning robotic reaching and pushing tasks and compared with disturbance-unaware baselines. The results show that the disturbance-augmented models can achieve higher stabilization and robustness in the control response, which in turn improves the prospects of successful sim2real transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology (TCST)</p></details> |
| **[W2S-AlignTree: Weak-to-Strong Inference-Time Alignment for Large Language Models via Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11518v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, yet their outputs often suffer from misalignment with human preferences due to the inadequacy of weak supervision and a lack of fine-grained control. Training-time alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) face prohibitive costs in expert supervision and inherent scalability limitations, offering limited dynamic control during inference. Consequently, there is an urgent need for scalable and adaptable alignment mechanisms. To address this, we propose W2S-AlignTree, a pioneering plug-and-play inference-time alignment framework that synergistically combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the Weak-to-Strong Generalization paradigm for the first time. W2S-AlignTree formulates LLM alignment as an optimal heuristic search problem within a generative search tree. By leveraging weak model's real-time, step-level signals as alignment proxies and introducing an Entropy-Aware exploration mechanism, W2S-AlignTree enables fine-grained guidance during strong model's generation without modifying its parameters. The approach dynamically balances exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional generation search trees. Experiments across controlled sentiment generation, summarization, and instruction-following show that W2S-AlignTree consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, W2S-AlignTree raises the performance of Llama3-8B from 1.89 to 2.19, a relative improvement of 15.9 on the summarization task.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Oral |
| **[Honesty over Accuracy: Trustworthy Language Models through Reinforced Hesitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11500v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern language models fail a fundamental requirement of trustworthy intelligence: knowing when not to answer. Despite achieving impressive accuracy on benchmarks, these models produce confident hallucinations, even when wrong answers carry catastrophic consequences. Our evaluations on GSM8K, MedQA and GPQA show frontier models almost never abstain despite explicit warnings of severe penalties, suggesting that prompts cannot override training that rewards any answer over no answer. As a remedy, we propose Reinforced Hesitation (RH): a modification to Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to use ternary rewards (+1 correct, 0 abstention, -$λ$ error) instead of binary. Controlled experiments on logic puzzles reveal that varying $λ$ produces distinct models along a Pareto frontier, where each training penalty yields the optimal model for its corresponding risk regime: low penalties produce aggressive answerers, high penalties conservative abstainers. We then introduce two inference strategies that exploit trained abstention as a coordination signal: cascading routes queries through models with decreasing risk tolerance, while self-cascading re-queries the same model on abstention. Both outperform majority voting with lower computational cost. These results establish abstention as a first-class training objective that transforms ``I don't know'' from failure into a coordination signal, enabling models to earn trust through calibrated honesty about their limits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Sparsity: Challenging Common Sparsity Assumptions for Learning World Models in Robotic Reinforcement Learning Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08086v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of learned dynamics models, also known as world models, can improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning. Recent work suggests that the underlying causal graphs of such dynamics models are sparsely connected, with each of the future state variables depending only on a small subset of the current state variables, and that learning may therefore benefit from sparsity priors. Similarly, temporal sparsity, i.e. sparsely and abruptly changing local dynamics, has also been proposed as a useful inductive bias. In this work, we critically examine these assumptions by analyzing ground-truth dynamics from a set of robotic reinforcement learning environments in the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, aiming to determine whether the proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity actually tend to hold in typical reinforcement learning tasks. We study (i) whether the causal graphs of environment dynamics are sparse, (ii) whether such sparsity is state-dependent, and (iii) whether local system dynamics change sparsely. Our results indicate that global sparsity is rare, but instead the tasks show local, state-dependent sparsity in their dynamics and this sparsity exhibits distinct structures, appearing in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affecting specific subsets of state dimensions. These findings challenge common sparsity prior assumptions in dynamics learning, emphasizing the need for grounded inductive biases that reflect the state-dependent sparsity structure of real-world dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Portfolio Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11481v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for dynamic portfolio optimization under market uncertainty and risk. The proposed model integrates a Sharpe ratio-based reward function with direct risk control mechanisms, including maximum drawdown and volatility constraints. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn adaptive asset allocation strategies over historical financial time series. Model performance is benchmarked against mean-variance and equal-weight portfolio strategies using backtesting on high-performing equities. Results indicate that the DRL agent stabilizes volatility successfully but suffers from degraded risk-adjusted returns due to over-conservative policy convergence, highlighting the challenge of balancing exploration, return maximization, and risk mitigation. The study underscores the need for improved reward shaping and hybrid risk-aware strategies to enhance the practical deployment of DRL-based portfolio allocation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Context-aware Adaptive Visualizations for Critical Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11476v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective decision-making often relies on timely insights from complex visual data. While Information Visualization (InfoVis) dashboards can support this process, they rarely adapt to users' cognitive state, and less so in real time. We present Symbiotik, an intelligent, context-aware adaptive visualization system that leverages neurophysiological signals to estimate mental workload (MWL) and dynamically adapt visual dashboards using reinforcement learning (RL). Through a user study with 120 participants and three visualization types, we demonstrate that our approach improves task performance and engagement. Symbiotik offers a scalable, real-time adaptation architecture, and a validated methodology for neuroadaptive user interfaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRMD: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Malware Detection under Concept Drift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18839v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malware detection in real-world settings must deal with evolving threats, limited labeling budgets, and uncertain predictions. Traditional classifiers, without additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept drift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern malware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning (AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this work, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov Decision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent, simultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting high-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and drift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent through time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic drift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under these conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to standard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved resilience to concept drift. Specifically, the DRMD agent achieved an average AUT improvement of 8.66 and 10.90 for the classification-only and classification-rejection policies, respectively. Our results demonstrate for the first time that DRL can facilitate effective malware detection and improved resiliency to concept drift in the dynamic setting of Android malware detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>The F...</summary><p>The Fortieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Phase Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization via Transformer-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11402v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous spacecraft control for mission phases such as launch, ascent, stage separation, and orbit insertion remains a critical challenge due to the need for adaptive policies that generalize across dynamically distinct regimes. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in individual astrodynamics tasks, existing approaches often require separate policies for distinct mission phases, limiting adaptability and increasing operational complexity. This work introduces a transformer-based RL framework that unifies multi-phase trajectory optimization through a single policy architecture, leveraging the transformer's inherent capacity to model extended temporal contexts. Building on proximal policy optimization (PPO), our framework replaces conventional recurrent networks with a transformer encoder-decoder structure, enabling the agent to maintain coherent memory across mission phases spanning seconds to minutes during critical operations. By integrating a Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) architecture, the framework eliminates manual phase transitions while maintaining stability in control decisions. We validate our approach progressively: first demonstrating near-optimal performance on single-phase benchmarks (double integrator and Van der Pol oscillator), then extending to multiphase waypoint navigation variants, and finally tackling a complex multiphase rocket ascent problem that includes atmospheric flight, stage separation, and vacuum operations. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based framework not only matches analytical solutions in simple cases but also effectively learns coherent control policies across dynamically distinct regimes, establishing a foundation for scalable autonomous mission planning that reduces reliance on phase-specific controllers while maintaining compatibility with safety-critical verification protocols.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust and Efficient Communication in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11393v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emotions, Context, and Substance Use in Adolescents: A Large Language Model Analysis of Reddit Posts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14037v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early substance use during adolescence increases the risk of later substance use disorders and mental health problems, yet the emotional and contextual factors driving these behaviors remain poorly understood. This study analyzed 23000 substance-use related posts and an equal number of non-substance posts from Reddit's r/teenagers community (2018-2022). Posts were annotated for six discrete emotions (sadness, anger, joy, guilt, fear, disgust) and contextual factors (family, peers, school) using large language models (LLMs). Statistical analyses compared group differences, and interpretable machine learning (SHAP) identified key predictors of substance-use discussions. LLM-assisted thematic coding further revealed latent psychosocial themes linking emotions with contexts. Negative emotions, especially sadness, guilt, fear, and disgust, were significantly more common in substance-use posts, while joy dominated non-substance discussions. Guilt and shame diverged in function: guilt often reflected regret and self-reflection, whereas shame reinforced risky behaviors through peer performance. Peer influence emerged as the strongest contextual factor, closely tied to sadness, fear, and guilt. Family and school environments acted as both risk and protective factors depending on relational quality and stress levels. Overall, adolescent substance-use discussions reflected a dynamic interplay of emotion, social context, and coping behavior. By integrating statistical analysis, interpretable models, and LLM-based thematic exploration, this study demonstrates the value of mixed computational approaches for uncovering the emotional and contextual mechanisms underlying adolescent risk behavior.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |
| **[MarsRL: Advancing Multi-Agent Reasoning System via Reinforcement Learning with Agentic Pipeline Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11373v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has been propelled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and test-time scaling. However, the limited output length of LLMs constrains the depth of reasoning attainable in a single inference process. Multi-agent reasoning systems offer a promising alternative by employing multiple agents including Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, to iteratively refine solutions. While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities. To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system. MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to enhance efficiency in handling long trajectories. Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improves AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507. These findings highlight the potential of MarsRL to advance multi-agent reasoning systems and broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[RLSLM: A Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Framework Aligning Rule-Based Social Locomotion Model with Human Social Norms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11323v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[STaR: Towards Cognitive Table Reasoning via Slow-Thinking Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11233v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sashimi-Bot: Autonomous Tri-manual Advanced Manipulation and Cutting of Deformable Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11223v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced robotic manipulation of deformable, volumetric objects remains one of the greatest challenges due to their pliancy, frailness, variability, and uncertainties during interaction. Motivated by these challenges, this article introduces Sashimi-Bot, an autonomous multi-robotic system for advanced manipulation and cutting, specifically the preparation of sashimi. The objects that we manipulate, salmon loins, are natural in origin and vary in size and shape, they are limp and deformable with poorly characterized elastoplastic parameters, while also being slippery and hard to hold. The three robots straighten the loin; grasp and hold the knife; cut with the knife in a slicing motion while cooperatively stabilizing the loin during cutting; and pick up the thin slices from the cutting board or knife blade. Our system combines deep reinforcement learning with in-hand tool shape manipulation, in-hand tool cutting, and feedback of visual and tactile information to achieve robustness to the variabilities inherent in this task. This work represents a milestone in robotic manipulation of deformable, volumetric objects that may inspire and enable a wide range of other real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Humanoid Whole-Body Badminton via Multi-Stage Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11218v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots have demonstrated strong capability for interacting with deterministic scenes across locomotion, manipulation, and more challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Yet the real world is dynamic, quasi-static interactions are insufficient to cope with the various environmental conditions. As a step toward more dynamic interaction scenario, we present a reinforcement-learning-based training pipeline that produces a unified whole-body controller for humanoid badminton, enabling coordinated lower-body footwork and upper-body striking without any motion priors or expert demonstrations. Training follows a three-stage curriculum: first footwork acquisition, then precision-guided racket swing generation, and finally task-focused refinement, yielding motions in which both legs and arms serve the hitting objective. For deployment, we incorporate an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate and predict shuttlecock trajectories for target striking. We also introduce a prediction-free variant that dispenses with EKF and explicit trajectory prediction. To validate the framework, we conduct five sets of experiment in both simulation and the real world. In simulation, two robots sustain a rally of 21 consecutive hits. Moreover, the prediction-free variant achieves successful hits with comparable performance relative to the target-known policy. In real-world tests, both the prediction and controller module exhibit high accuracy, and on-court hitting achieves an outgoing shuttle speed up to 10 m/s with a mean return landing distance of 3.5 m. These experiment results show that our humanoid robot can deliver highly dynamic while precise goal striking in badminton, and can be adapted to more dynamism critical domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategic Opponent Modeling with Graph Neural Networks, Deep Reinforcement Learning and Probabilistic Topic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10501v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper provides a comprehensive review of mainly Graph Neural Networks, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Probabilistic Topic Modeling methods with a focus on their potential incorporation in strategic multiagent settings. We draw interest in (i) Machine Learning methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular that of Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Following, we describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes PTM in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. The capability of PTM to estimate unknown underlying distributions can help with tackling heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. Finally, we identify certain open challenges specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Efficient Learning-Based Control of a Legged Robot in Lunar Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10128v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legged robots are promising candidates for exploring challenging areas on low-gravity bodies such as the Moon, Mars, or asteroids, thanks to their advanced mobility on unstructured terrain. However, as planetary robots' power and thermal budgets are highly restricted, these robots need energy-efficient control approaches that easily transfer to multiple gravity environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based control approach for legged robots with gravity-scaled power-optimized reward functions. We use our approach to develop and validate a locomotion controller and a base pose controller in gravity environments from lunar gravity (1.62 m/s2) to a hypothetical super-Earth (19.62 m/s2). Our approach successfully scales across these gravity levels for locomotion and base pose control with the gravity-scaled reward functions. The power-optimized locomotion controller reached a power consumption for locomotion of 23.4 W in Earth gravity on a 15.65 kg robot at 0.4 m/s, a 23 % improvement over the baseline policy. Additionally, we designed a constant-force spring offload system that allowed us to conduct real-world experiments on legged locomotion in lunar gravity. In lunar gravity, the power-optimized control policy reached 12.2 W, 36 % less than a baseline controller which is not optimized for power efficiency. Our method provides a scalable approach to developing power-efficient locomotion controllers for legged robots across multiple gravity levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoRaCompass: Robust Reinforcement Learning to Efficiently Search for a LoRa Tag](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11190v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Long-Range (LoRa) protocol, known for its extensive range and low power, has increasingly been adopted in tags worn by mentally incapacitated persons (MIPs) and others at risk of going missing. We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2. It has demonstrated high success rate (>90%) in locating the tag within 100m proximity (a 40% improvement over existing methods) and high efficiency with a search path length (in hops) that scales linearly with the initial distance.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in visual language models (VLMs) highlight the potential of automatic UI coding, but current approaches face two key limitations: multimodal coding capabilities remain underdeveloped, and single-turn paradigms make little use of iterative visual feedback. We address these challenges with an interactive UI-to-code paradigm that better reflects real-world workflows and raises the upper bound of achievable performance. Under this paradigm, we present UI2Code$^\text{N}$, a visual language model trained through staged pretraining, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning to achieve foundational improvements in multimodal coding. The model unifies three key capabilities: UI-to-code generation, UI editing, and UI polishing. We further explore test-time scaling for interactive generation, enabling systematic use of multi-turn feedback. Experiments on UI-to-code and UI polishing benchmarks show that UI2Code$^\text{N}$ establishes a new state of the art among open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models such as Claude-4-Sonnet and GPT-5. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/zai-org/UI2Code_N.</p></details> | 24 pages |
| **[AffectGPT-R1: Leveraging Reinforcement Learning for Open-Vocabulary Multimodal Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01318v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Multimodal Emotion Recognition (OV-MER) aims to predict emotions without being constrained by predefined label spaces, enabling fine-grained emotion understanding. Unlike traditional discriminative methods, OV-MER leverages generative models, such as large language models, to capture the full spectrum of emotions and employs emotion wheels (EWs) for metric calculation. Previous approaches (e.g., AffectGPT) primarily rely on token-level loss during training. However, this objective is misaligned with the metrics used in OV-MER, while these metrics cannot be optimized via gradient backpropagation. In this paper, we propose AffectGPT-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that formulates EW-based metrics as a reward function and employs a policy-based optimization strategy to maximize this reward. Additionally, we introduce an extra reasoning process and investigate its necessity in OV-MER. To further refine model behavior, we incorporate auxiliary rewards that constrain both reasoning and emotion prediction. To prevent reward hacking, we propose to incorporate length penalties during training. Experimental results show that AffectGPT-R1 achieves substantial improvements on OV-MER. Beyond this task, our approach also enhances generalized emotion understanding, attaining state-of-the-art performance on MER-UniBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to adapt the R1-style methodology for emotion understanding, revealing the impact of reasoning processes and reinforcement learning in this domain. Our code is provided in the supplementary material and will be released to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIDEOP2R: Video Understanding from Perception to Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11113v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Generative Models in Condition and Structural Health Monitoring: Opportunities, Limitations and Future Outlook](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15026v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Condition and structural health monitoring (CM/SHM) is a pivotal component of predictive maintenance (PdM) strategies across diverse industrial sectors, including mechanical rotating machinery, aircraft structures, wind turbines, and civil infrastructures. Conventional deep learning models, while effective for fault diagnosis and anomaly detection through automatic feature learning from sensor data, often struggle with operational variability, imbalanced or scarce fault datasets, and multimodal sensory data from complex systems. Deep generative models (DGMs) including deep autoregressive models, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, diffusion-based models, and emerging large language models, offer transformative capabilities by synthesizing high-fidelity data samples, reconstructing latent system states, and modeling complex multimodal data streams. This review systematically examines state-of-the-art DGM applications in CM/SHM across the four main industrial systems mentioned above, emphasizing their roles in addressing key challenges: data generation, domain adaptation and generalization, multimodal data fusion, and downstream fault diagnosis and anomaly detection tasks, with rigorous comparison among signal processing, conventional machine learning or deep learning models, and DGMs. Lastly, we discuss current limitations of DGMs, including challenges of explainable and trustworthy models, computational inefficiencies for edge deployment, and the need for parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies. Future research directions can focus on zero-shot and few-shot learning, robust multimodal data generation, hybrid architectures integrating DGMs with physics knowledge, and reinforcement learning with DGMs to enhance robustness and accuracy in industrial scenarios.</p></details> | 48 pages |
| **[Scalable Population Training for Zero-Shot Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11083v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot coordination(ZSC) has become a hot topic in reinforcement learning research recently. It focuses on the generalization ability of agents, requiring them to coordinate well with collaborators that are not seen before without any fine-tuning. Population-based training has been proven to provide good zero-shot coordination performance; nevertheless, existing methods are limited by computational resources, mainly focusing on optimizing diversity in small populations while neglecting the potential performance gains from scaling population size. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Scalable Population Training (ScaPT), an efficient training framework comprising two key components: a meta-agent that efficiently realizes a population by selectively sharing parameters across agents, and a mutual information regularizer that guarantees population diversity. To empirically validate the effectiveness of ScaPT, this paper evaluates it along with representational frameworks in Hanabi and confirms its superiority.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADPO: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18913v6)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for aligning language models, but its reliance on hard pairwise labels makes it brittle under noise; our experiments show performance degrading by up to 93 percent in noisy settings. We introduce Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO), a unified framework that addresses this fragility through reference anchoring. By minimizing KL(q || softmax((l - l_ref) / tau_anc)), where l_ref are reference policy log probabilities, ADPO provides three key advantages: (1) it unifies major learning paradigms, including supervised fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, maximum-entropy reinforcement learning, and DPO, as special cases through different choices of target distribution q, anchor policy pi_ref, and temperature tau_anc; (2) it induces an implicit trust region governed by the softmax Fisher metric with curvature scaling as 1 / tau_anc^2, providing geometric regularization absent in standard methods; and (3) it enables flexible anchor strategies tailored to different learning contexts. Empirically, ADPO consistently outperforms standard DPO by 12 to 93 percent across twelve noisy scenarios, with listwise variants achieving top performance in eleven of twelve cases. In offline distillation, ADPO reduces student-teacher KL by 4 to 49 times while achieving superior returns (for example, 279.3 vs -309.0 for knowledge distillation on HalfCheetah). We further uncover a task-dependent tradeoff: dynamic anchors excel at online exploration in noisy environments (plus 5 to 11 percent), while fixed anchors enable stable offline distillation. Our work establishes anchoring as a general principle for robust policy optimization, with clear practical guidance for anchor selection across diverse learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multistep Quasimetric Learning for Scalable Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07730v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning how to reach goals in an environment is a longstanding challenge in AI, yet reasoning over long horizons remains a challenge for modern methods. The key question is how to estimate the temporal distance between pairs of observations. While temporal difference methods leverage local updates to provide optimality guarantees, they often perform worse than Monte Carlo methods that perform global updates (e.g., with multi-step returns), which lack such guarantees. We show how these approaches can be integrated into a practical GCRL method that fits a quasimetric distance using a multistep Monte-Carlo return. We show our method outperforms existing GCRL methods on long-horizon simulated tasks with up to 4000 steps, even with visual observations. We also demonstrate that our method can enable stitching in the real-world robotic manipulation domain (Bridge setup). Our approach is the first end-to-end GCRL method that enables multistep stitching in this real-world manipulation domain from an unlabeled offline dataset of visual observations.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, such as simple moving averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks, inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for dynamic and efficient supply chain management.</p></details> |  |

We show that these are two sides of the same coin. By reverse-engineering existing advantage-shaping algorithms, we reveal that they implicitly optimize surrogate rewards. We specifically interpret practical "hard-example up-weighting" modifications to GRPO as reward-level regularization. Conversely, starting from surrogate reward objectives, we provide a simple recipe for deriving both existing and new advantage-shaping methods. This perspective provides a lens for RLVR policy gradient optimization beyond our original motivation of Pass@K.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: T...</summary><p>v2: Typos fixed.

We analyzed eight attack scenarios in four categories: architectural attacks on convolutional neural networks, large language models, and reinforcement learning agents; infrastructure attacks exploiting federated learning and medical documentation systems; critical resource allocation attacks affecting organ transplantation and crisis triage; and supply chain attacks targeting commercial foundation models. Our findings indicate that attackers with access to only 100-500 samples can compromise healthcare AI regardless of dataset size, often achieving over 60 percent success, with detection taking an estimated 6 to 12 months or sometimes not occurring at all. The distributed nature of healthcare infrastructure creates many entry points where insiders with routine access can launch attacks with limited technical skill. Privacy laws such as HIPAA and GDPR can unintentionally shield attackers by restricting the analyses needed for detection. Supply chain weaknesses allow a single compromised vendor to poison models across 50 to 200 institutions. The Medical Scribe Sybil scenario shows how coordinated fake patient visits can poison data through legitimate clinical workflows without requiring a system breach. Current regulations lack mandatory adversarial robustness testing, and federated learning can worsen risks by obscuring attribution. We recommend multilayer defenses including required adversarial testing, ensemble-based detection, privacy-preserving security mechanisms, and international coordination on AI security standards. We also question whether opaque black-box models are suitable for high-stakes clinical decisions, suggesting a shift toward interpretable systems with verifiable safety guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Training Pipeline for Reasoning Graphical User Interface Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08172v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual grounding is the task of localising image regions from natural language queries and is critical for reasoning capable Graphical User Interface agents. Many existing methods rely on massive, noisy synthetic datasets. This work introduces an efficient training pipeline that combines model-based data filtering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. From 4.8M synthetic examples, 12K clean and diverse instances are curated by first identifying challenging cases, removing misaligned and then selecting a diverse set of multimodal instances. On this data, a 3B-parameter Vision-Language Model is trained under three regimes: supervised fine-tuning, chain-of-thought-augmented fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. Models trained with the filtered data and lightweight training strategies match or surpass larger baselines on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and AndroidControl. These results demonstrate that principled data curation and robust adaptation can rival large-scale training, enabling compact yet capable multimodal reasoning agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Data is the Algorithm: A Systematic Study and Curation of Preference Optimization Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10985v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) is a central objective of post-training, often achieved through reward modeling and reinforcement learning methods. Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provable Domain Adaptation for Offline Reinforcement Learning with Limited Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12136v4)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns effective policies from a static target dataset. The performance of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms notwithstanding, it relies on the size of the target dataset, and it degrades if limited samples in the target dataset are available, which is often the case in real-world applications. To address this issue, domain adaptation that leverages auxiliary samples from related source datasets (such as simulators) can be beneficial. However, establishing the optimal way to trade off the limited target dataset and the large-but-biased source dataset while ensuring provably theoretical guarantees remains an open challenge. To the best of our knowledge, this paper proposes the first framework that theoretically explores the impact of the weights assigned to each dataset on the performance of offline RL. In particular, we establish performance bounds and the existence of the optimal weight, which can be computed in closed form under simplifying assumptions. We also provide algorithmic guarantees in terms of convergence to a neighborhood of the optimum. Notably, these results depend on the quality of the source dataset and the number of samples in the target dataset. Our empirical results on the well-known offline Procgen benchmark substantiate the theoretical contributions in this work.</p></details> |  |

While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.</p></details> |  |

However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

| **[Hypergraph Neural Network with State Space Models for Node Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06587v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention for node classification tasks on graph-structured data. However, traditional GNNs primarily focus on adjacency relationships between nodes, often overlooking the role-based characteristics that can provide complementary insights for learning expressive node representations. Existing frameworks for extracting role-based features are largely unsupervised and often fail to translate effectively into downstream predictive tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a hypergraph neural network with a state space model (HGMN). The model integrates role-aware representations into GNNs by combining hypergraph construction with state-space modeling in a principled manner. HGMN employs hypergraph construction techniques to capture higher-order relationships and leverages a learnable mamba transformer mechanism to fuse role-based and adjacency-based embeddings. By exploring two distinct hypergraph construction strategies, degree-based and neighborhood-based, the framework reinforces connectivity among nodes with structural similarity, thereby enriching the learned representations. Furthermore, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution layers enables the model to account for complex dependencies within hypergraph structures. To alleviate the over-smoothing problem encountered in deeper networks, we incorporate residual connections, which improve stability and promote effective feature propagation across layers. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets including OGB, ACM, DBLP, IIP TerroristRel, Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed demonstrate that HGMN consistently outperforms strong baselines in node classification tasks. These results support the claim that explicitly incorporating role-based features within a hypergraph framework offers tangible benefits for node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the dynamic and stochastic nature of these environments, with uncertainties such as equipment failures, truck maintenance, and variable haul cycle times, challenges traditional optimization. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) shows strong potential for adaptive decision-making in mining logistics, practical deployment requires evaluation in realistic, customizable simulation environments. The lack of standardized benchmarking hampers fair algorithm comparison, reproducibility, and real-world applicability of RL solutions. To address this, we present Mining-Gym -- a configurable, open-source benchmarking environment for training, testing, and evaluating RL algorithms in mining process optimization. Built on Salabim-based Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and integrated with Gymnasium, Mining-Gym captures mining-specific uncertainties through an event-driven decision-point architecture. It offers a GUI for parameter configuration, data logging, and real-time visualization, supporting reproducible evaluation of RL strategies and heuristic baselines. We validate Mining-Gym by comparing classical heuristics with RL-based scheduling across six scenarios from normal operation to severe equipment failures. Results show it is an effective, reproducible testbed, enabling fair evaluation of adaptive decision-making and demonstrating the strong performance potential of RL-trained schedulers.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Instella, a family of fully open three billion parameter language models trained entirely on openly available data and codebase. Powered by AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs, Instella is developed through large-scale pre-training, general-purpose instruction tuning, and alignment with human preferences. Despite using substantially fewer pre-training tokens than many contemporaries, Instella achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open models and is competitive with leading open-weight models of comparable size. We further release two specialized variants: Instella-Long, capable of handling context lengths up to 128K tokens, and Instella-Math, a reasoning-focused model enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on mathematical tasks. Together, these contributions establish Instella as a transparent, performant, and versatile alternative for the community, advancing the goal of open and reproducible language modeling research.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration. Empirical results indicate that leveraging high and low-level intrinsic rewards from the graph encoder-decoder significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art GCHRL approaches with an extra small computational cost in dense and sparse reward environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trans...</summary><p>Transactions on Machine Learning Research (2025)</p></details> |

In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026 (main track)</p></details> |
| **[From Efficiency to Adaptivity: A Deeper Look at Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10788v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.</p></details> |  |

However, extending EQCs to larger TSP problem sizes remains challenging due to the exponential time and memory for quantum circuit simulation, as well as increasing noise and decoherence when running on actual quantum hardware. In this work, we propose the Size-Invariant Grid Search (SIGS), an efficient training optimization for Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL), and use it to simulate the outputs of a trained Depth-1 EQC up to 350-node TSP instances - well beyond previously tractable limits. At TSP with 100 nodes, we reduce total simulation times by 96.4%, when comparing to RL simulations with the analytical expression (151 minutes using RL to under 6 minutes using SIGS on TSP-100), while achieving a mean optimality gap within 0.005 of the RL trained model on the test set. SIGS provides a practical benchmarking tool for the QRL community, allowing us to efficiently analyze the performance of QRL algorithms on larger problem sizes. We provide a theoretical explanation for SIGS called the Size-Invariant Properties that goes beyond the concept of equivariance discussed in prior literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing the Outcome Reward-based RL Training of MLLMs with Self-Consistency Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10648v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) is a common and increasingly significant way to refine the step-by-step reasoning of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 (The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems)</p></details> |

While most research focuses on preventing such events, we instead concentrate on the phenomenon of falling itself. Specifically, we aim to reduce physical damage to the robot while providing users with control over a robot's end pose. To this end, we propose a robot agnostic reward function that balances the achievement of a desired end pose with impact minimization and the protection of critical robot parts during reinforcement learning. To make the policy robust to a broad range of initial falling conditions and to enable the specification of an arbitrary and unseen end pose at inference time, we introduce a simulation-based sampling strategy of initial and end poses. Through simulated and real-world experiments, our work demonstrates that even bipedal robots can perform controlled, soft falls.</p></details> |  |
| **[Global Solutions to Non-Convex Functional Constrained Problems with Hidden Convexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10626v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained non-convex optimization is fundamentally challenging, as global solutions are generally intractable and constraint qualifications may not hold. However, in many applications, including safe policy optimization in control and reinforcement learning, such problems possess hidden convexity, meaning they can be reformulated as convex programs via a nonlinear invertible transformation. Typically such transformations are implicit or unknown, making the direct link with the convex program impossible. On the other hand, (sub-)gradients with respect to the original variables are often accessible or can be easily estimated, which motivates algorithms that operate directly in the original (non-convex) problem space using standard (sub-)gradient oracles. In this work, we develop the first algorithms to provably solve such non-convex problems to global minima. First, using a modified inexact proximal point method, we establish global last-iterate convergence guarantees with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ oracle complexity in non-smooth setting. For smooth problems, we propose a new bundle-level type method based on linearly constrained quadratic subproblems, improving the oracle complexity to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-1})$. Surprisingly, despite non-convexity, our methodology does not require any constraint qualifications, can handle hidden convex equality constraints, and achieves complexities matching those for solving unconstrained hidden convex optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Emotionally Intelligent and Responsible Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10573v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.</p></details> |  |

Rigorous evaluation and effective training for such capabilities are hindered by the lack of high-quality, human-annotated benchmarks and reliable, interpretable reward signals. In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL. This work establishes rubrics as a powerful tool for both training and evaluating advanced IF in LLMs, paving the way for more capable and reliable AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Considering a number of $\aleph$ agents operating in the same Markov decision process, however possibly with different reward functions, we consider the regret each agent suffers with respect to an optimal policy maximizing her average reward. We show that when the agents share their observations the total regret of all agents is smaller by a factor of $\sqrt{\aleph}$ compared to the case when each agent has to rely on the information collected by herself. This result demonstrates how considering the regret in multi-agent settings can provide theoretical bounds on the benefit of sharing observations in transfer learning.</p></details> |  |

Intent misunderstandings can frustrate users and create safety risks. To address this, we propose generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single structured response to ambiguous requests. Our models are trained with reinforcement learning and customized reward functions using multiple valid answers as supervision. Experiments on conversational question answering and semantic parsing demonstrate that our method achieves higher coverage of valid answers than baseline approaches. Human evaluation confirms that predicted interpretations are highly aligned with their answers. Our approach promotes transparency with explicit interpretations, achieves efficiency by requiring only one generation step, and supports downstream applications through its structured output format.</p></details> |  |

But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous environments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile or slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning algorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning shows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when formulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1) are unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location; 2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with variable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board deployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a novel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and develop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and Attention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple example of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the time) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic solver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi. This work paves the way for increased resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, most existing explanation methods focus on centralized MARL, failing to address the uncertainty and nondeterminism inherent in decentralized settings. We propose methods to generate policy summarizations that capture task ordering and agent cooperation in decentralized MARL policies, along with query-based explanations for When, Why Not, and What types of user queries about specific agent behaviors. We evaluate our approach across four MARL domains and two decentralized MARL algorithms, demonstrating its generalizability and computational efficiency.

However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[MonkeyOCR v1.5 Technical Report: Unlocking Robust Document Parsing for Complex Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10390v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document parsing is a core task in document intelligence, supporting applications such as information extraction, retrieval-augmented generation, and automated document analysis. However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Operator Models for Continuous-Time Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10383v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-time stochastic processes underlie many natural and engineered systems. In healthcare, autonomous driving, and industrial control, direct interaction with the environment is often unsafe or impractical, motivating offline reinforcement learning from historical data. However, there is limited statistical understanding of the approximation errors inherent in learning policies from offline datasets. We address this by linking reinforcement learning to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and proposing an operator-theoretic algorithm based on a simple dynamic programming recursion. Specifically, we represent our world model in terms of the infinitesimal generator of controlled diffusion processes learned in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. By integrating statistical learning methods and operator theory, we establish global convergence of the value function and derive finite-sample guarantees with bounds tied to system properties such as smoothness and stability. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that operator-based approaches may hold promise in solving offline reinforcement learning using continuous-time optimal control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constructing an Optimal Behavior Basis for the Option Keyboard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00787v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task reinforcement learning aims to quickly identify solutions for new tasks with minimal or no additional interaction with the environment. Generalized Policy Improvement (GPI) addresses this by combining a set of base policies to produce a new one that is at least as good -- though not necessarily optimal -- as any individual base policy. Optimality can be ensured, particularly in the linear-reward case, via techniques that compute a Convex Coverage Set (CCS). However, these are computationally expensive and do not scale to complex domains. The Option Keyboard (OK) improves upon GPI by producing policies that are at least as good -- and often better. It achieves this through a learned meta-policy that dynamically combines base policies. However, its performance critically depends on the choice of base policies. This raises a key question: is there an optimal set of base policies -- an optimal behavior basis -- that enables zero-shot identification of optimal solutions for any linear tasks? We solve this open problem by introducing a novel method that efficiently constructs such an optimal behavior basis. We show that it significantly reduces the number of base policies needed to ensure optimality in new tasks. We also prove that it is strictly more expressive than a CCS, enabling particular classes of non-linear tasks to be solved optimally. We empirically evaluate our technique in challenging domains and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, increasingly so as task complexity increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Proceedings of the Thirty-ninth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Rectify Evaluation Preference: Improving LLMs' Critique on Math Reasoning via Perplexity-aware Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10303v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To improve Multi-step Mathematical Reasoning (MsMR) of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is crucial to obtain scalable supervision from the corpus by automatically critiquing mistakes in the reasoning process of MsMR and rendering a final verdict of the problem-solution. Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct. Extensive experimental results on our built OPS and existing available critic benchmarks demonstrate the validity of our method.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 |
| **[Causal Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Sample-Efficient IoT Channel Access](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10291v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the advantages of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for wireless use case such as medium access control (MAC), their real-world deployment in Internet of Things (IoT) is hindered by their sample inefficiency. To alleviate this challenge, one can leverage model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) solutions, however, conventional MBRL approaches rely on black-box models that are not interpretable and cannot reason. In contrast, in this paper, a novel causal model-based MARL framework is developed by leveraging tools from causal learn- ing. In particular, the proposed model can explicitly represent causal dependencies between network variables using structural causal models (SCMs) and attention-based inference networks. Interpretable causal models are then developed to capture how MAC control messages influence observations, how transmission actions determine outcomes, and how channel observations affect rewards. Data augmentation techniques are then used to generate synthetic rollouts using the learned causal model for policy optimization via proximal policy optimization (PPO). Analytical results demonstrate exponential sample complexity gains of causal MBRL over black-box approaches. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, on average, the proposed approach can reduce environment interactions by 58%, and yield faster convergence compared to model-free baselines. The proposed approach inherently is also shown to provide interpretable scheduling decisions via attention-based causal attribution, revealing which network conditions drive the policy. The resulting combination of sample efficiency and interpretability establishes causal MBRL as a practical approach for resource-constrained wireless systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Music Flamingo: Scaling Music Understanding in Audio Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10289v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Music Flamingo, a novel large audio-language model designed to advance music (including song) understanding in foundational audio models. While audio-language research has progressed rapidly, music remains challenging due to its dynamic, layered, and information-dense nature. Progress has been further limited by the difficulty of scaling open audio understanding models, primarily because of the scarcity of high-quality music data and annotations. As a result, prior models are restricted to producing short, high-level captions, answering only surface-level questions, and showing limited generalization across diverse musical cultures. To address these challenges, we curate MF-Skills, a large-scale dataset labeled through a multi-stage pipeline that yields rich captions and question-answer pairs covering harmony, structure, timbre, lyrics, and cultural context. We fine-tune an enhanced Audio Flamingo 3 backbone on MF-Skills and further strengthen multiple skills relevant to music understanding. To improve the model's reasoning abilities, we introduce a post-training recipe: we first cold-start with MF-Think, a novel chain-of-thought dataset grounded in music theory, followed by GRPO-based reinforcement learning with custom rewards. Music Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art results across 10+ benchmarks for music understanding and reasoning, establishing itself as a generalist and musically intelligent audio-language model. Beyond strong empirical results, Music Flamingo sets a new standard for advanced music understanding by demonstrating how models can move from surface-level recognition toward layered, human-like perception of songs. We believe this work provides both a benchmark and a foundation for the community to build the next generation of models that engage with music as meaningfully as humans do.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/adlr/MF/</p></details> |

Existing post-training paradigms are limited: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) relies on costly step-level annotations, while Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO provide only sparse, outcome-level feedback, hindering stable optimization. We introduce PROPA (Process-level Reasoning Optimization with interleaved Policy Alignment), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GRPO to generate dense, process-level rewards and optimize reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. To overcome the cold-start problem, PROPA interleaves GRPO updates with SFT, enabling the model to learn from both successful and failed reasoning trajectories. A Process Reward Model (PRM) is further trained to guide inference-time search, aligning the test-time search with the training signal. Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines. It achieves up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art, establishing a strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks.

While existing methods achieve strong performance through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy Optimization), transforming these consistency patterns into rewards for test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generality of our approach: using only 1,272 unlabeled data, GUI-RCPO achieves 3-6% accuracy improvements across various architectures on ScreenSpot benchmarks. Our approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more data-efficient GUI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>[Acce...</summary><p>[Accepted by AAAI2026] Project Page: https://zju-real.github.io/gui-rcpo Code: https://github.com/zju-real/gui-rcpo</p></details> |

Heuristic search is a standard approach for solving such problems, relying on a heuristic function to estimate the cost to the goal from any given state. Recent approaches leverage reinforcement learning to learn heuristics by applying deep approximate value iteration. These methods typically rely on single-step Bellman updates, where the heuristic of a state is updated based on its best neighbor and the corresponding edge cost. This work proposes a generalized approach that enhances both state sampling and heuristic updates by performing limited-horizon searches and updating each state's heuristic based on the shortest path to the search frontier, incorporating both edge costs and the heuristic values of frontier states.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preconditioned Inexact Stochastic ADMM for Deep Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10784v4)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancement of foundation models (FMs) has brought about a paradigm shift, revolutionizing various sectors worldwide. The popular optimizers used to train these models are stochastic gradient descent-based algorithms, which face inherent limitations, such as slow convergence and stringent assumptions for convergence. In particular, data heterogeneity arising from distributed settings poses significant challenges to their theoretical and numerical performance. This paper develops an algorithm, PISA (Preconditioned Inexact Stochastic Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers). Grounded in rigorous theoretical guarantees, the algorithm converges under the sole assumption of Lipschitz continuity of the gradient on a bounded region, thereby removing the need for other conditions commonly imposed by stochastic methods. This capability enables the proposed algorithm to tackle the challenge of data heterogeneity effectively. Moreover, the algorithmic architecture enables scalable parallel computing and supports various preconditions, such as second-order information, second moment, and orthogonalized momentum by Newton-Schulz iterations. Incorporating the latter two preconditions in PISA yields two computationally efficient variants: SISA and NSISA. Comprehensive experimental evaluations for training or fine-tuning diverse deep models, including vision models, large language models, reinforcement learning models, generative adversarial networks, and recurrent neural networks, demonstrate superior numerical performance of SISA and NSISA compared to various state-of-the-art optimizers.</p></details> |  |

In reinforcement learning, ICL reframes learning as a supervised problem, facilitating task adaptation without parameter updates. Building on prior work leveraging transformers for sequential decision-making, we propose Heuristic Transformer (HT), an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) approach that augments the in-context dataset with a belief distribution over rewards to achieve better decision-making. Using a variational auto-encoder (VAE), a low-dimensional stochastic variable is learned to represent the posterior distribution over rewards, which is incorporated alongside an in-context dataset and query states as prompt to the transformer policy. We assess the performance of HT across the Darkroom, Miniworld, and MuJoCo environments, showing that it consistently surpasses comparable baselines in terms of both effectiveness and generalization. Our method presents a promising direction to bridge the gap between belief-based augmentations and transformer-based decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Offline Reinforcement Learning via Quantum Metric Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10187v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with limited samples is common in real-world applications. However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding. We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL. We further investigate the $Δ$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $Δ$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $Δ$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the 80/20 Rule: High-Entropy Minority Tokens Drive Effective Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01939v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), while its mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e., forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20 rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71 on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models, highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the 80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to further improve LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025. 25 pages, 17 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning-Based Channel Access in Wi-Fi: A Multi-Armed Bandit Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10143v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to its static protocol design, IEEE 802.11 (aka Wi-Fi) channel access lacks adaptability to address dynamic network conditions, resulting in inefficient spectrum utilization, unnecessary contention, and packet collisions. This paper investigates reinforcement learning (RL) solutions to optimize Wi-Fi's medium access control (MAC). In particular, a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework is proposed for dynamic channel access (including both the primary channel and channel width) and contention window (CW) adjustment. In this setting, we study relevant learning design principles such as adopting joint or factorial action spaces (handled by a single agent (SA) and multiple agents (MA), respectively) and the importance of incorporating contextual information. Our simulation results show that cooperative MA architectures converge faster than their SA counterparts, as agents operate over smaller action spaces. Another key insight is that contextual MAB algorithms consistently outperform non-contextual ones, highlighting the value of leveraging side information in action selection. Moreover, in multi-player settings, results demonstrate that decentralized learners can achieve implicit coordination, although their greediness may degrade coexisting networks' performance and induce policy-chasing dynamics. Overall, these findings demonstrate that (contextual) MAB-based learning offers a practical and adaptive alternative to static IEEE 802.11 protocols, enabling more efficient and intelligent spectrum utilization.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Multi-agent Markov Entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02385v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Value decomposition has long been a fundamental technique in multi-agent dynamic programming and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, the value function of a global state $(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)$ is often approximated as the sum of local functions: $V(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)\approx\sum_{i=1}^N V_i(s_i)$. This approach traces back to the index policy in restless multi-armed bandit problems and has found various applications in modern RL systems. However, the theoretical justification for why this decomposition works so effectively remains underexplored. In this paper, we uncover the underlying mathematical structure that enables value decomposition. We demonstrate that a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) permits value decomposition if and only if its transition matrix is not "entangled" -- a concept analogous to quantum entanglement in quantum physics. Drawing inspiration from how physicists measure quantum entanglement, we introduce how to measure the "Markov entanglement" for multi-agent MDPs and show that this measure can be used to bound the decomposition error in general multi-agent MDPs. Using the concept of Markov entanglement, we proved that a widely-used class of index policies is weakly entangled and enjoys a sublinear $\mathcal O(\sqrt{N})$ scale of decomposition error for $N$-agent systems. Finally, we show how Markov entanglement can be efficiently estimated in practice, providing practitioners with an empirical proxy for the quality of value decomposition.</p></details> |  |

We propose UEPO, a unified generative framework inspired by large language model pretraining and fine-tuning strategies. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a multi-seed dynamics-aware diffusion policy that efficiently captures diverse modalities without training multiple models; (2) a dynamic divergence regularization mechanism that enforces physically meaningful policy diversity; and (3) a diffusion-based data augmentation module that enhances dynamics model generalization. On the D4RL benchmark, UEPO achieves +5.9\% absolute improvement over Uni-O4 on locomotion tasks and +12.4\% on dexterous manipulation, demonstrating strong generalization and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Embodied World Models for Decision Making</p></details> |
| **[Tree-Based Stochastic Optimization for Solving Large-Scale Urban Network Security Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10072v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban Network Security Games (UNSGs), which model the strategic allocation of limited security resources on city road networks, are critical for urban safety. However, finding a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in large-scale UNSGs is challenging due to their massive and combinatorial action spaces. One common approach to addressing these games is the Policy-Space Response Oracle (PSRO) framework, which requires computing best responses (BR) at each iteration. However, precisely computing exact BRs is impractical in large-scale games, and employing reinforcement learning to approximate BRs inevitably introduces errors, which limits the overall effectiveness of the PSRO methods. Recent advancements in leveraging non-convex stochastic optimization to approximate an NE offer a promising alternative to the burdensome BR computation. However, utilizing existing stochastic optimization techniques with an unbiased loss function for UNSGs remains challenging because the action spaces are too vast to be effectively represented by neural networks. To address these issues, we introduce Tree-based Stochastic Optimization (TSO), a framework that bridges the gap between the stochastic optimization paradigm for NE-finding and the demands of UNSGs. Specifically, we employ the tree-based action representation that maps the whole action space onto a tree structure, addressing the challenge faced by neural networks in representing actions when the action space cannot be enumerated. We then incorporate this representation into the loss function and theoretically demonstrate its equivalence to the unbiased loss function. To further enhance the quality of the converged solution, we introduce a sample-and-prune mechanism that reduces the risk of being trapped in suboptimal local optima. Extensive experimental results indicate the superiority of TSO over other baseline algorithms in addressing the UNSGs.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned. Experiments on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets demonstrate that RadFlow consistently improves diagnostic coherence and overall report quality compared with state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences. Extensive experiments on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination show that RL-CoMM improves the accuracy by 10~30\% over the baseline model with limited training data.

This capability has also been explored in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where agents interact with the environment to retrieve context and maximize cumulative rewards, showcasing strong adaptability in complex settings. However, in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), where agents must coordinate toward a shared goal, decentralized policy deployment can lead to mismatches in task alignment and reward assignment, limiting the efficiency of policy adaptation. To address this challenge, we introduce Multi-agent In-context Coordination via Decentralized Memory Retrieval (MAICC), a novel approach designed to enhance coordination by fast adaptation. Our method involves training a centralized embedding model to capture fine-grained trajectory representations, followed by decentralized models that approximate the centralized one to obtain team-level task information. Based on the learned embeddings, relevant trajectories are retrieved as context, which, combined with the agents' current sub-trajectories, inform decision-making. During decentralized execution, we introduce a novel memory mechanism that effectively balances test-time online data with offline memory. Based on the constructed memory, we propose a hybrid utility score that incorporates both individual- and team-level returns, ensuring credit assignment across agents. Extensive experiments on cooperative MARL benchmarks, including Level-Based Foraging (LBF) and SMAC (v1/v2), show that MAICC enables faster adaptation to unseen tasks compared to existing methods.

However, the massive data volumes and real-time demands of IoT applications strain traditional cloud computing architectures. This paper explores the complementary roles of cloud, fog, and edge computing in enhancing IoT performance, focusing on their ability to reduce latency, improve scalability, and ensure data privacy. We propose a novel framework, the Hierarchical IoT Processing Architecture (HIPA), which dynamically allocates computational tasks across cloud, fog, and edge layers using machine learning. By synthesizing current research and introducing HIPA, this paper highlights how these paradigms can create efficient, secure, and scalable IoT ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

Mixed-dataset training has recently become a practical route to improve cross-domain robustness, but it introduces underexplored issues: 1) inter-dataset supervision conflicts, which distract identity learning, and 2) redundant or noisy samples, which reduce data efficiency and may reinforce dataset-specific patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce a unified paradigm for cross-dataset gait learning that simultaneously improves motion-signal quality and supervision consistency. We first increase the reliability of training data by suppressing sequences dominated by redundant gait cycles or unstable silhouettes, guided by representation redundancy and prediction uncertainty. This refinement concentrates learning on informative gait dynamics when mixing heterogeneous datasets. In parallel, we stabilize supervision by disentangling metric learning across datasets, forming triplets within each source to prevent destructive cross-domain gradients while preserving transferable identity cues. These components act in synergy to stabilize optimization and strengthen generalization without modifying network architectures or requiring extra annotations. Experiments on CASIA-B, OU-MVLP, Gait3D, and GREW with both GaitBase and DeepGaitV2 backbones consistently show improved cross-domain performance without sacrificing in-domain accuracy. These results demonstrate that data selection and aligning supervision effectively enables scalable mixed-dataset gait learning.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Multimodal approaches to emotional support show great promise by integrating diverse data sources to provide empathetic, contextually relevant responses, fostering more effective interactions. However, current methods have notable limitations, often relying solely on text or converting other data types into text, or providing emotion recognition only, thus overlooking the full potential of multimodal inputs. Moreover, many studies prioritize response generation without accurately identifying critical emotional support elements or ensuring the reliability of outputs. To overcome these issues, we introduce \textsc{ MultiMood}, a new framework that (i) leverages multimodal embeddings from video, audio, and text to predict emotional components and to produce responses responses aligned with professional therapeutic standards. To improve trustworthiness, we (ii) incorporate novel psychological criteria and apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize large language models (LLMs) for consistent adherence to these standards. We also (iii) analyze several advanced LLMs to assess their multimodal emotional support capabilities. Experimental results show that MultiMood achieves state-of-the-art on MESC and DFEW datasets while RL-driven trustworthiness improvements are validated through human and LLM evaluations, demonstrating its superior capability in applying a multimodal framework in this domain.</p></details> |  |

Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.</p></details> |  |

Manual tuning these knobs is laborious and inefficient due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of the configuration space. Among the automated tuning methods, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have recently sought to improve the DBMS knobs tuning process from several different perspectives. However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods. To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method. Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner. As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate the significant advantages of DemoTuner in both performance improvement and online tuning cost reduction over three representative baselines including DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune. Additionally, DemoTuner also exhibits superior adaptability to application scenarios with unknown workloads.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

Despite its practical success, its theoretical properties remain underexplored. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework that models experience replay using resampled $U$- and $V$-statistics, providing rigorous variance reduction guarantees. We apply this framework to policy evaluation tasks using the Least-Squares Temporal Difference (LSTD) algorithm and a Partial Differential Equation (PDE)-based model-free algorithm, demonstrating significant improvements in stability and efficiency, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. Beyond policy evaluation, we extend the framework to kernel ridge regression, showing that the experience replay-based method reduces the computational cost from the traditional $O(n^3)$ in time to as low as $O(n^2)$ in time while simultaneously reducing variance. Extensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the broad applicability and effectiveness of experience replay in diverse machine learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, in standard residual updates, the module's output is directly added to the input stream. This can lead to updates that predominantly reinforce or modulate the existing stream direction, potentially underutilizing the module's capacity for learning entirely novel features. In this work, we introduce Orthogonal Residual Update: we decompose the module's output relative to the input stream and add only the component orthogonal to this stream. This design aims to guide modules to contribute primarily new representational directions, fostering richer feature learning while promoting more efficient training. We demonstrate that our orthogonal update strategy improves generalization accuracy and training stability across diverse architectures (ResNetV2, Vision Transformers) and datasets (CIFARs, TinyImageNet, ImageNet-1k), achieving, for instance, a +3.78 pp top-1 accuracy gain for ViT-B on ImageNet-1k.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, maybe final final version</p></details> |

Yet Reinforcement Learning (RL) motion policies typically lose stability under prolonged operation, sensor/actuator noise, and real world disturbances. In this work, we propose a Selective Adversarial Attack for Robust Training (SA2RT) to enhance the robustness of motion skills. The adversary is learned to identify and sparsely perturb the most vulnerable states and actions under an attack-budget constraint, thereby exposing true weakness without inducing conservative overfitting. The resulting non-zero sum, alternating optimization continually strengthens the motion policy against the strongest discovered attacks. We validate our approach on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot across perceptive locomotion and whole-body control tasks. Experimental results show that adversarially trained policies improve the terrain traversal success rate by 40%, reduce the trajectory tracking error by 32%, and maintain long horizon mobility and tracking performance. Together, these results demonstrate that selective adversarial attacks are an effective driver for learning robust, long horizon humanoid motion skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, AAAI2026</p></details> |

The limitation arises from MLLMs' context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before feeding videos into MLLMs. However, building a trainable sampling method remains challenging due to the unsupervised and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling in Video-MLLMs. To address these problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization for the temporal sampling policy. Furthermore, we propose a dual-style long video training data construction pipeline, balancing comprehensive temporal understanding and key segment localization. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge Video-MLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Hui-design/TSPO</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[The Markovian Thinker: Architecture-Agnostic Linear Scaling of Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06557v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget. With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus. The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink. Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B) often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient, scalable reasoning LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose HierRouter, a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from a pool of specialized, lightweight language models. Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), our approach trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference. The agent conditions on the evolving context and accumulated cost to make context-aware routing decisions. Experiments with three open-source candidate LLMs across six benchmarks, including QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, show that HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to using individual models independently, while incurring only a minimal additional inference cost on average. These results highlight the promise of hierarchical routing for cost-efficient, high-performance LLM inference.

To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity. Beyond this, InTRO enables cross-domain transfer, successfully adapting to out-of-domain reasoning tasks that extend beyond the realm of mathematics, demonstrating robust generalization.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Oral |

In practice, selecting the best checkpoint is challenging: evaluating checkpoints on the validation set during training is computationally expensive and requires a good validation set, while relying on the final checkpoint provides no guarantee of good performance. We introduce an uncertainty-guided approach for checkpoint selection (UGCS) that avoids these pitfalls. Our method identifies hard question-answer pairs using per-sample uncertainty and ranks checkpoints by how well they handle these challenging cases. By averaging the rewards of the top-uncertain samples over a short training window, our method produces a stable and discriminative signal without additional forward passes or significant computation overhead. Experiments across three datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that it consistently identifies checkpoints with stronger generalization, outperforming traditional strategies such as relying on training or validation performance. These results highlight that models solving their hardest tasks with low uncertainty are the most reliable overall.</p></details> |  |

Yet these systems still lack reliable mechanisms to guarantee that sensitive information can be permanently removed once it has been used. Retraining from the beginning is prohibitively costly, and existing unlearning methods remain fragmented, difficult to verify, and often vulnerable to recovery. This paper surveys recent research on machine unlearning for LLMs and considers how far current approaches can address these challenges. We review methods for evaluating whether forgetting has occurred, the resilience of unlearned models against adversarial attacks, and mechanisms that can support user trust when model complexity or proprietary limits restrict transparency. Technical solutions such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and ephemeral memory are examined alongside institutional safeguards including auditing practices and regulatory frameworks. The review finds steady progress, but robust and verifiable unlearning is still unresolved. Efficient techniques that avoid costly retraining, stronger defenses against adversarial recovery, and governance structures that reinforce accountability are needed if LLMs are to be deployed safely in sensitive applications. By integrating technical and organizational perspectives, this study outlines a pathway toward AI systems that can be required to forget, while maintaining both privacy and public trust.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

We identify two main limitations related to sparse reward settings and policy gradient updates, based on which we formulate a key insight: updates from positive samples with high returns typically do not require policy regularisation, whereas updates from negative samples, reflecting undesirable behaviour, can harm model performance. This paper introduces Succeed or Learn Slowly (SoLS), a novel off-policy RL algorithm evaluated on mobile app control tasks. SoLS improves sample efficiency when fine-tuning foundation models for user interface navigation via a modified off-policy actor-critic approach, applying direct policy updates for positive samples and conservative, regularised updates for negative ones to prevent model degradation. We augment SoLS with Successful Transition Replay (STR), which prioritises learning from successful interactions, further improving sample efficiency. We evaluate SoLS on the AndroidWorld benchmark, where it significantly outperforms existing methods (at least 17% relative increase), including prompt-engineering and RL approaches, while requiring substantially fewer computational resources than GPT-4o-based methods with 5-60x faster inference.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Motivated by problems in long-term causal inference, we extend DRL to a semiparametric setting and develop doubly robust, automatic estimators for general linear functionals of the Q-function in infinite-horizon, time-homogeneous MDPs. By imposing structure on the Q-function, we relax the overlap conditions required by nonparametric methods and obtain efficiency gains. The second obstacle--density-ratio estimation--typically requires computationally expensive and unstable min-max optimization. To address both challenges, we introduce superefficient nonparametric estimators whose limiting variance falls below the generalized Cramer-Rao bound. These estimators treat the Q-function as a one-dimensional summary of the state-action process, reducing high-dimensional overlap requirements to a single-dimensional condition. The procedure is simple to implement: estimate and calibrate the Q-function using fitted Q-iteration, then plug the result into the target functional, thereby avoiding density-ratio estimation altogether.</p></details> |  |

To ensure individual-global-max (IGM) consistency, existing methods either enforce monotonicity constraints, which limit expressive power, or adopt softer surrogates at the cost of algorithmic complexity. In this work, we present a dynamical systems analysis of non-monotonic value decomposition, modeling learning dynamics as continuous-time gradient flow. We prove that, under approximately greedy exploration, all zero-loss equilibria violating IGM consistency are unstable saddle points, while only IGM-consistent solutions are stable attractors of the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments on both synthetic matrix games and challenging MARL benchmarks demonstrate that unconstrained, non-monotonic factorization reliably recovers IGM-optimal solutions and consistently outperforms monotonic baselines. Additionally, we investigate the influence of temporal-difference targets and exploration strategies, providing actionable insights for the design of future value-based MARL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

In GRPO, prompts are answered by the model and, through reinforcement learning, preferred completions are learnt. Owing to the small communication volume, GRPO is inherently suitable for decentralised training as the prompts can be concurrently answered by multiple nodes and then exchanged in the forms of strings. In this work, we present the first adversarial attack in decentralised GRPO. We demonstrate that malicious parties can poison such systems by injecting arbitrary malicious tokens in benign models in both out-of-context and in-context attacks. Using empirical examples of math and coding tasks, we show that adversarial attacks can easily poison the benign nodes, polluting their local LLM post-training, achieving attack success rates up to 100% in as few as 50 iterations. We propose two ways to defend against these attacks, depending on whether all users train the same model or different models. We show that these defenses can achieve stop rates of up to 100%, making the attack impossible.</p></details> |  |

We present Vision-Language-Action Planning & Search (VLAPS) -- a novel framework and accompanying algorithms that embed model-based search into the inference procedure of pre-trained VLA policies to improve their performance on robotic tasks. Specifically, our method biases a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm -- run using a model of the target environment -- using action priors defined by the VLA policy. By using VLA-derived abstractions and priors in model-based search, VLAPS efficiently explores language-conditioned robotics tasks whose search spaces would otherwise be intractably large. Conversely, by integrating model-based search with the VLA policy's inference procedure, VLAPS yields behaviors that are more performant than those obtained by directly following the VLA policy's action predictions. VLAPS offers a principled framework to: i) control test-time compute in VLA models, ii) leverage a priori knowledge of the robotic environment, and iii) integrate established planning and reinforcement learning techniques into the VLA inference process. Across all experiments, VLAPS significantly outperforms VLA-only baselines on language-specified tasks that would otherwise be intractable for uninformed search algorithms, increasing success rates by as much as 67 percentage points.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we focus on contextual reinforcement learning, where agents act within environments with varying contexts, such as self-driving cars or quadrupedal robots that need to operate in different terrains or weather conditions than they were trained for. We tackle the critical task of generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, without access to explicit context information at test time. Recent work has addressed this problem by training a context encoder and a history adaptation module in separate stages. While promising, this two-phase approach is cumbersome to implement and train. We simplify the methodology and introduce SPARC: single-phase adaptation for robust control. We test SPARC on varying contexts within the high-fidelity racing simulator Gran Turismo 7 and wind-perturbed MuJoCo environments, and find that it achieves reliable and robust OOD generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an oral at AAAI 2026.

The agent learns self-touch and hand regard behaviors through intrinsic rewards that mimic an infant's curiosity-driven exploration of its own body. For self-touch, high-dimensional tactile inputs are transformed into compact, meaningful representations, enabling efficient learning. The agent then discovers new tactile contacts through intrinsic rewards and curriculum learning that encourage broad body coverage, balance, and generalization. For hand regard, visual features of the hands, such as skin-color and shape, are learned through motor babbling. Then, intrinsic rewards encourage the agent to perform novel hand motions, and follow its hands with its gaze. A curriculum learning setup from single-hand to dual-hand training allows the agent to reach complex visual-motor coordination. The results of this work demonstrate that purely curiosity-based signals, with no external supervision, can drive coordinated multimodal learning, imitating an infant's progression from random motor babbling to purposeful behaviors.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 tables |

Many robust RL approaches follow two strategies: enforcing smoothness in actor or actor-critic modules with Lipschitz regularization, or learning robust Bellman operators. However, the first strategy does not investigate the impact of critic-only Lipschitz regularization on policy robustness, while the second lacks comprehensive validation in real-world scenarios. Building on this gap and prior work, we propose PPO-PGDLC, an algorithm based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that integrates Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) with a Lipschitz-regularized critic (LC). The PGD component calculates the adversarial state within an uncertainty set to approximate the robust Bellman operator, and the Lipschitz-regularized critic further improves the smoothness of learned policies. Experimental results on two classic control tasks and one real-world robotic locomotion task demonstrates that, compared to several baseline algorithms, PPO-PGDLC achieves better performance and predicts smoother actions under environmental perturbations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

This limitation undermines occupant comfort and trust, potentially hindering the adoption of AV technologies. We propose PACE-ADS (Psychology and Cognition Enabled Automated Driving Systems), a human-centered autonomy framework enabling AVs to sense, interpret, and respond to both external traffic conditions and internal occupant states. PACE-ADS uses an agentic workflow where three foundation model agents collaborate: the Driver Agent interprets the external environment; the Psychologist Agent decodes passive psychological signals (e.g., EEG, heart rate, facial expressions) and active cognitive inputs (e.g., verbal commands); and the Coordinator Agent synthesizes these inputs to generate high-level decisions that enhance responsiveness and personalize the ride. PACE-ADS complements, rather than replaces, conventional AV modules. It operates at the semantic planning layer, while delegating low-level control to native systems. The framework activates only when changes in the rider's psychological state are detected or when occupant instructions are issued. It integrates into existing AV platforms with minimal adjustments, positioning PACE-ADS as a scalable enhancement. We evaluate it in closed-loop simulations across diverse traffic scenarios, including intersections, pedestrian interactions, work zones, and car-following. Results show improved ride comfort, dynamic behavioral adjustment, and safe recovery from edge-case scenarios via autonomous reasoning or rider input. PACE-ADS bridges the gap between technical autonomy and human-centered mobility.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, one colummns</p></details> |

Each node is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware evaluation in microservice systems.</p></details> |  |

An Extensive Approach Considering Statistical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09450v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>6,227...</summary><p>6,227 words text + 2*250 (2 tables) = 6,727 words</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Centrality: Understanding Urban Street Network Typologies Through Intersection Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06747v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The structure of road networks plays a pivotal role in shaping transportation dynamics. It also provides insights into how drivers experience city streets and helps uncover each urban environment's unique characteristics and challenges. Consequently, characterizing cities based on their road network patterns can facilitate the identification of similarities and differences, informing collaborative traffic management strategies, particularly at a regional scale. While previous studies have investigated global network patterns for cities, they have often overlooked detailed characterizations within a single large urban region. Additionally, most existing research uses metrics like degree, centrality, orientation, etc., and misses the nuances of street networks at the intersection level, specifically the geometric angles formed by links at intersections, which could offer a more refined feature for characterization. To address these gaps, this study examines over 100 cities in the San Francisco Bay Area. We introduce a novel metric for classifying intersections, distinguishing between different types of 3-way and 4-way intersections based on the angles formed at the intersections. Through the application of clustering algorithms in machine learning, we have identified three distinct typologies - grid, orthogonal, and organic cities - within the San Francisco Bay Area. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the metric in capturing the differences between cities based on street and intersection patterns. The typologies generated in this study could offer valuable support for city planners and policymakers in crafting a range of practical strategies tailored to the complexities of each city's road network, covering aspects such as evacuation plans, traffic signage placements, and traffic signal control.</p></details> |  |
| **[SymLight: Exploring Interpretable and Deployable Symbolic Policies for Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05790v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning have achieved significant success in automatically devising effective traffic signal control (TSC) policies. Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate SymLight's superior performance across a range of baselines. A key advantage is SymLight's ability to produce interpretable and deployable TSC policies while maintaining excellent performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ethics-Aware Safe Reinforcement Learning for Rare-Event Risk Control in Interactive Urban Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14926v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on embedding credible and transparent ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers, particularly to protect vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians and cyclists. Here, we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that augments standard driving objectives with ethics-aware cost signals. At the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level motion targets. A dynamic, risk-sensitive Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level, polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our approach on closed-loop simulation environments derived from large-scale, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods in reducing risk to others while maintaining ego performance and comfort. This work provides a reproducible benchmark for Safe RL with explicitly ethics-aware objectives in human-mixed traffic scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically accountable autonomy that explicitly protects those most at risk in urban traffic environments. Across two interactive benchmarks and five random seeds, our policy decreases conflict frequency by 25-45% compared to matched task successes while maintaining comfort metrics within 5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Injection-Throttling Mechanisms for Congestion Control for Data-center and Supercomputer Interconnects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05149v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, Supercomputers and Data centers have evolved dramatically to cope with the increasing performance requirements of applications and services, such as scientific computing, generative AI, social networks or cloud services. This evolution have led these systems to incorporate high-speed networks using faster links, end nodes using multiple and dedicated accelerators, or a advancements in memory technologies to bridge the memory bottleneck. The interconnection network is a key element in these systems and it must be thoroughly designed so it is not the bottleneck of the entire system, bearing in mind the countless communication operations that generate current applications and services. Congestion is serious threat that spoils the interconnection network performance, and its effects are even more dramatic when looking at the traffic dynamics and bottlenecks generated by the communication operations mentioned above. In this vein, numerous congestion control (CC) techniques have been developed to address congestion negative effects. One popular example is Data Center Quantized Congestion Notification (DCQCN), which allows congestion detection at network switch buffers, then marking congesting packets and notifying about congestion to the sources, which finally apply injection throttling of those packets contributing to congestion. While DCQCN has been widely studied and improved, its main principles for congestion detection, notification and reaction remain largely unchanged, which is an important shortcoming considering congestion dynamics in current high-performance interconnection networks. In this paper, we revisit the DCQCN closed-loop mechanism and refine its design to leverage a more accurate congestion detection, signaling, and injection throttling, reducing control traffic overhead and avoiding unnecessary throttling of non-congesting flows.</p></details> | 4 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Improving dynamic congestion isolation in data-center networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04639v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of distributed AI and large-scale applications has impacted the communication operations of data-center and Supercomputer interconnection networks, leading to dramatic incast or in-network congestion scenarios and challenging existing congestion control mechanisms, such as injection throttling (e.g., DCQCN) or congestion isolation (CI). While DCQCN provides a scalable traffic rate adjustment for congesting flows at end nodes (which is slow) and CI effectively isolates these flows in special network resources (which requires extra logic in the switches), their combined use, although it diminishes their particular drawbacks, leads to false congestion scenarios identification and signaling, excessive throttling, and inefficient network resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a new CI mechanism, called Improved Congestion Isolation (ICI), which efficiently combines CI and DCQCN so that the information of the isolated congesting flows is used to guide the ECN marking performed by DCQCN in a way that victim flows do not end up being marked. This coordination reduces false-positive congestion detection, suppresses unnecessary closed-loop feedback (i.e., wrong congestion notifications), and improves responsiveness to communication microbursts. Evaluated under diverse traffic patterns, including incast and Data-center workloads, ICI reduces the number of generated BECNs by up to 32x and improves tail latency by up to 31%, while maintaining high throughput and scalability.</p></details> | 26 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Optimizing Multi-Lane Intersection Performance in Mixed Autonomy Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02217v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the main challenges in managing traffic at multilane intersections is ensuring smooth coordination between human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This paper presents a novel traffic signal control framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning to address this challenge. GATs are used to model the dynamic graph- structured nature of traffic flow to capture spatial and temporal dependencies between lanes and signal phases. The proposed SAC is a robust off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that enables adaptive signal control through entropy-optimized decision making. This design allows the system to coordinate the signal timing and vehicle movement simultaneously with objectives focused on minimizing travel time, enhancing performance, ensuring safety, and improving fairness between HDVs and CAVs. The model is evaluated using a SUMO-based simulation of a four-way intersection and incorporating different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1% reduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the fairness ratio between HDVs and CAVs improved to 1.59, indicating more equitable treatment across vehicle types. These findings suggest that the GAT-SAC framework holds significant promise for real-world deployment in mixed-autonomy traffic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Static Thresholds: Adaptive RRC Signaling Storm Detection with Extreme Value Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01391v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 5G and beyond networks, the radio communication between a User Equipment (UE) and a base station (gNodeB or gNB), also known as the air interface, is a critical component of network access and connectivity. During the connection establishment procedure, the Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer can be vulnerable to signaling storms, which threaten the availability of the radio access control plane. These attacks may occur when one or more UEs send a large number of connection requests to the gNB, preventing new UEs from establishing connections. In this paper, we investigate the detection of such threats and propose an adaptive threshold-based detection system based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT). The proposed solution is evaluated numerically by applying simulated attack scenarios based on a realistic threat model on top of real-world RRC traffic data from an operator network. We show that, by leveraging features from the RRC layer only, the detection system can not only identify the attacks but also differentiate them from legitimate high-traffic situations. The adaptive threshold calculated using EVT ensures that the system can work under diverse traffic conditions. The results show high accuracy, precision, and recall values (above 93%), and a low detection latency even under complex conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MSWiM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Logic-informed reinforcement learning for cross-domain optimization of large-scale cyber-physical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00806v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) require the joint optimization of discrete cyber actions and continuous physical parameters under stringent safety logic constraints. However, existing hierarchical approaches often compromise global optimality, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) in hybrid action spaces often relies on brittle reward penalties, masking, or shielding and struggles to guarantee constraint satisfaction. We present logic-informed reinforcement learning (LIRL), which equips standard policy-gradient algorithms with projection that maps a low-dimensional latent action onto the admissible hybrid manifold defined on-the-fly by first-order logic. This guarantees feasibility of every exploratory step without penalty tuning. Experimental evaluations have been conducted across multiple scenarios, including industrial manufacturing, electric vehicle charging stations, and traffic signal control, in all of which the proposed method outperforms existing hierarchical optimization approaches. Taking a robotic reducer assembly system in industrial manufacturing as an example, LIRL achieves a 36.47\% to 44.33\% reduction at most in the combined makespan-energy objective compared to conventional industrial hierarchical scheduling methods. Meanwhile, it consistently maintains zero constraint violations and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art hybrid-action reinforcement learning baselines. Thanks to its declarative logic-based constraint formulation, the framework can be seamlessly transferred to other domains such as smart transportation and smart grid, thereby paving the way for safe and real-time optimization in large-scale CPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-agent Reinforcement Learning Model for Regional Adaptive Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00551v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several studies have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges of regional adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) and achieved promising results. In this field, existing research predominantly adopts multi-agent frameworks. However, the adoption of multi-agent frameworks presents challenges for scalability. Instead, the Traffic signal control (TSC) problem necessitates a single-agent framework. TSC inherently relies on centralized management by a single control center, which can monitor traffic conditions across all roads in the study area and coordinate the control of all intersections. This work proposes a single-agent RL-based regional ATSC model compatible with probe vehicle technology. Key components of the RL design include state, action, and reward function definitions. To facilitate learning and manage congestion, both state and reward functions are defined based on queue length, with action designed to regulate queue dynamics. The queue length definition used in this study differs slightly from conventional definitions but is closely correlated with congestion states. More importantly, it allows for reliable estimation using link travel time data from probe vehicles. With probe vehicle data already covering most urban roads, this feature enhances the proposed method's potential for widespread deployment. The method was comprehensively evaluated using the SUMO simulation platform. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively mitigates large-scale regional congestion levels via coordinated multi-intersection control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control Under Demand Fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00549v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion, primarily driven by intersection queuing, significantly impacts urban living standards, safety, environmental quality, and economic efficiency. While Traffic Signal Control (TSC) systems hold potential for congestion mitigation, traditional optimization models often fail to capture real-world traffic complexity and dynamics. This study introduces a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for regional adaptive TSC, circumventing the coordination complexities inherent in multi-agent systems through a centralized decision-making paradigm. The model employs an adjacency matrix to unify the encoding of road network topology, real-time queue states derived from probe vehicle data, and current signal timing parameters. Leveraging the efficient learning capabilities of the DreamerV3 world model, the agent learns control policies where actions sequentially select intersections and adjust their signal phase splits to regulate traffic inflow/outflow, analogous to a feedback control system. Reward design prioritizes queue dissipation, directly linking congestion metrics (queue length) to control actions. Simulation experiments conducted in SUMO demonstrate the model's effectiveness: under inference scenarios with multi-level (10%, 20%, 30%) Origin-Destination (OD) demand fluctuations, the framework exhibits robust anti-fluctuation capability and significantly reduces queue lengths. This work establishes a new paradigm for intelligent traffic control compatible with probe vehicle technology. Future research will focus on enhancing practical applicability by incorporating stochastic OD demand fluctuations during training and exploring regional optimization mechanisms for contingency events.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dual Large Language Models Architecture with Herald Guided Prompts for Parallel Fine Grained Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00136v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging large language models (LLMs) in traffic signal control (TSC) improves optimization efficiency and interpretability compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. However, existing LLM-based approaches are limited by fixed time signal durations and are prone to hallucination errors, while RL methods lack robustness in signal timing decisions and suffer from poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes HeraldLight, a dual LLMs architecture enhanced by Herald guided prompts. The Herald Module extracts contextual information and forecasts queue lengths for each traffic phase based on real-time conditions. The first LLM, LLM-Agent, uses these forecasts to make fine grained traffic signal control, while the second LLM, LLM-Critic, refines LLM-Agent's outputs, correcting errors and hallucinations. These refined outputs are used for score-based fine-tuning to improve accuracy and robustness. Simulation experiments using CityFlow on real world datasets covering 224 intersections in Jinan (12), Hangzhou (16), and New York (196) demonstrate that HeraldLight outperforms state of the art baselines, achieving a 20.03% reduction in average travel time across all scenarios and a 10.74% reduction in average queue length on the Jinan and Hangzhou scenarios.

| **[Retrieval Augmented Generation-Enhanced Distributed LLM Agents for Generalizable Traffic Signal Control with Emergency Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26242v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3 adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17 to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing deep learning models face significant challenges of high computational cost and insufficient interpretability due to their complex black-box nature. This paper introduces FlightKooba, a novel modeling approach designed to extract such underlying dynamics analytically. Our framework uniquely integrates HiPPO theory, Koopman operator theory, and control theory. By leveraging Legendre polynomial bases, it constructs Koopman operators analytically, thereby avoiding large-scale parameter training. The method's core strengths lie in its exceptional computational efficiency and inherent interpretability. Experiments on multiple public datasets validate our design philosophy: for signals exhibiting strong periodicity or clear physical laws (e.g., in aviation, meteorology, and traffic flow), FlightKooba delivers competitive prediction accuracy while reducing trainable parameters by several orders of magnitude and achieving the fastest training speed. Furthermore, we analyze the model's theoretical boundaries, clarifying its inherent low-pass filtering characteristics that render it unsuitable for sequences dominated by high-frequency noise. In summary, FlightKooba offers a powerful, efficient, and interpretable new alternative for time series analysis, particularly in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 2: Major revision of the manuscript to refine the narrative, clarify the model's theoretical limitations and application scope, and improve overall presentation for journal submission</p></details> |
| **[Drone Carry-on Weight and Wind Flow Assessment via Micro-Doppler Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22846v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote monitoring of drones has become a global objective due to emerging applications in national security and managing aerial delivery traffic. Despite their relatively small size, drones can carry significant payloads, which require monitoring, especially in cases of unauthorized transportation of dangerous goods. A drone's flight dynamics heavily depend on outdoor wind conditions and the carry-on weight, which affect the tilt angle of a drone's body and the rotation velocity of the blades. A surveillance radar can capture both effects, provided a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for the received echoes and an adjusted postprocessing detection algorithm. Here, we conduct a systematic study to demonstrate that micro-Doppler analysis enables the disentanglement of the impacts of wind and weight on a hovering drone. The physics behind the effect is related to the flight controller, as the way the drone counteracts weight and wind differs. When the payload is balanced, it imposes an additional load symmetrically on all four rotors, causing them to rotate faster, thereby generating a blade-related micro-Doppler shift at a higher frequency. However, the impact of the wind is different. The wind attempts to displace the drone, and to counteract this, the drone tilts to the side. As a result, the forward and rear rotors rotate at different velocities to maintain the tilt angle of the drone body relative to the airflow direction. This causes the splitting in the micro-Doppler spectra. By performing a set of experiments in a controlled environment, specifically, an anechoic chamber for electromagnetic isolation and a wind tunnel for imposing deterministic wind conditions, we demonstrate that both wind and payload details can be extracted using a simple deterministic algorithm based on branching in the micro-Doppler spectra.</p></details> |  |

Compared with traditional reinforcement learning and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three main advantages: zero-shot generalization, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by leveraging internal traffic-control policies and reasoning; a compact 3B-parameter design that supports real-time inference on mobile-class chips for edge deployment; and an explainable TSC process that enables multi-intersection coordination through communication and an asynchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks show Traffic-R1 outperforms strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In production, the model now manages signals affecting over 55,000 drivers daily, reduces average queue lengths by more than 5%, and halves operator workload.

As operations move to minute-- and second--level feedback, communication security shifts from a compliance item to an operational constraint: latency, reliability, and confidentiality jointly determine whether dispatch, protection, and settlement signals arrive on time. Conventional PKI and key-rotation schemes struggle with cross-domain, high-frequency messaging and face long-term quantum threats. Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers information-theoretic key freshness, but its key yield is scarce and stochastic, often misaligned with bursty VPP traffic. This paper proposes a key-aware priority and quota framework that treats quantum keys as first-class scheduling resources. The design combines (i) forecast-driven long-term quotas and short-term tokens, (ii) key-aware deficit-round-robin arbitration, (iii) a preemptive emergency key reserve, and (iv) graceful degradation via encryption-mode switching and controlled down-sampling for non-critical traffic. A drift-plus-penalty analysis establishes strong stability under average supply--demand balance with quantifiable bounds on backlog and tail latency, providing interpretable operating guarantees. We build a reproducible testbed on IEEE 33- and 123-bus VPP systems and evaluate normal, degraded, and outage regimes with industry-consistent message classes and TTLs. Against FIFO, fixed-priority, and static-quota baselines, the proposed scheme consistently reduces tail delay and passive timeouts for critical messages, improves per-bit key utility, and enhances power-tracking reliability during key scarcity and regime switches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Traffic Signals: Comparing MARL and Fixed-Time Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14544v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban traffic congestion, particularly at intersections, significantly impacts travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions. Traditional fixed-time signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency. More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world implementation challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLMLight: Safety-Critical Traffic Signal Control via Vision-Language Meta-Control and Dual-Branch Reasoning Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19486v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control (TSC) is a core challenge in urban mobility, where real-time decisions must balance efficiency and safety. Existing methods - ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type, motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems, while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1% degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware solution for next-generation traffic signal control.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Trajectory-based real-time pedestrian crash prediction at intersections: A novel non-linear link function for block maxima led Bayesian GEV framework addressing heterogeneous traffic condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12963v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study develops a real-time framework for estimating pedestrian crash risk at signalized intersections under heterogeneous, non-lane-based traffic. Existing approaches often assume linear relationships between covariates and parameters, oversimplifying the complex, non-monotonic interactions among different road users. To overcome this, the framework introduces a non-linear link function within a Bayesian generalized extreme value (GEV) structure to capture traffic variability more accurately. The framework applies extreme value theory through the block maxima approach using post-encroachment time as a surrogate safety measure. A hierarchical Bayesian model incorporating both linear and non-linear link functions into GEV parameters is estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. It also introduces a behavior-normalized Modified Crash Risk (MRC) formula to account for pedestrians' habitual risk-taking behavior. Seven Bayesian hierarchical models were developed and compared using deviance information criterion. Models employing non-linear link functions for the location and scale parameters significantly outperformed their linear counterparts. The results revealed that pedestrian speed has a negative relationship with crash risk, while flow and speed of motorized vehicles, pedestrian flow, and non-motorized vehicles conflicting speed contribute positively. The MRC formulation reduced overestimation and provided crash predictions with 93% confidence. The integration of non-linear link functions enhances model flexibility, capturing the non-linear nature of traffic extremes. The proposed MRC metric aligns crash risk estimates with real-world pedestrian behavior in mixed-traffic environments. This framework offers a practical analytical tool for traffic engineers and planners to design adaptive signal control and pedestrian safety interventions before crashes occur.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is a preprint and has not yet been peer-reviewed.

| **[Biased-Attention Guided Risk Prediction for Safe Decision-Making at Unsignalized Intersections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12428v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is available at https://github.com/hank111525/SAC-RWB.</p></details> |  |
| **[SALAD: Self-Adaptive Link Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05784v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) to the wireless link quality is critical for maximizing spectral efficiency while ensuring reliability. We propose SALAD (self-adaptive link adaptation), an algorithm that exclusively leverages ACK/NACK feedback to reliably track the evolution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), achieving high spectral efficiency while keeping the long-term block error rate (BLER) near a desired target. SALAD infers the SINR by minimizing the cross-entropy loss between received ACK/NACKs and predicted BLER values, with a learning rate that self-adapts online through knowledge distillation. Based on this inference, SALAD selects the MCS via hypothesis testing: if the SINR is likely underestimated, a higher MCS is selected to accelerate link adaptation under improving channel conditions. To prevent BLER drift from its long-term target, SALAD incorporates a feedback control loop that adjusts the instantaneous BLER target. Over-the-air experiments on a 5G testbed demonstrate that SALAD consistently outperforms the industry-standard outer-loop link adaptation (OLLA). With a single set of parameters, SALAD achieves up to 15% higher throughput and spectral efficiency than multiple OLLA variants across different traffic regimes, while meeting the BLER target.</p></details> |  |

Electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking features, extracted from an open-source dataset, were used to train and evaluate both conventional machine learning models and SNNs. Among the SNN architectures explored, a minimalistic, single-layer model trained with a biologically inspired delta-rule learning algorithm achieved competitive performance (80.6%). To enable deployment on neuromorphic hardware, the model was quantized and implemented on the mixed-signal DYNAP-SE chip. Despite hardware constraints and analog variability, the chip-deployed SNN maintained a classification accuracy of up to 73.5% using spike-based input. These results demonstrate the feasibility of event-driven neuromorphic systems for ultra-low-power, embedded cognitive state monitoring in dynamic real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

The 1 x 1 normalization scheme and two feature representations (coordinate- and angle-based) are presented for the pipeline. In addition, an efficient method to improve robustness against camera angle variations is also introduced by using artificially rotated training data. Experiments on a custom traffic-control gesture dataset demonstrate high accuracy across varying viewing angles and speeds. Finally, an approach to calculate the speed of the arm signal (if necessary) is also presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-Net: Transferable Queue Length Estimation via Kalman-based Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24725v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections remains a challenge in traffic management, especially under partially observed conditions where vehicle flows are not fully captured. This paper introduces Q-Net, a data-efficient and interpretable framework for queue length estimation that performs robustly even when traffic conservation assumptions are violated. Q-Net integrates two widely available and privacy-friendly data sources: (i) vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated floating car data (aFCD), which divides each road section into segments and provides segment-wise average speed measurements. These data sources often differ in spatial and temporal resolution, creating fusion challenges. Q-Net addresses this by employing a tailored state-space model and an AI-augmented Kalman filter, KalmanNet, which learns the Kalman gain from data without requiring prior knowledge of noise covariances or full system dynamics. We build on the vanilla KalmanNet pipeline to decouple measurement dimensionality from section length, enabling spatial transferability across road segments. Unlike black-box models, Q-Net maintains physical interpretability, with internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Evaluations on main roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, demonstrate that Q-Net outperforms baseline methods by over 60\% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accurately tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays. Q-Net also demonstrates strong spatial and temporal transferability, enabling deployment without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar. Additionally, we propose a real-time variant of Q-Net, highlighting its potential for integration into dynamic, queue-based traffic control systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[FuzzyLight: A Robust Two-Stage Fuzzy Approach for Traffic Signal Control Works in Real Cities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15820v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial in mitigating urban congestion and reducing emissions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several real-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor accuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data transmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions. (2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could be unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP) selection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on TSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting safety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust two-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing and RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It employs fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances the efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during training and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It works in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior performance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results indicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to expert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six real-world datasets with transmission noise.

| **[Reinforcement Learning Based Traffic Signal Design to Minimize Queue Lengths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21745v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial for reducing congestion, travel delays, pollution, and for ensuring road safety. Traditional approaches, such as fixed signal control and actuated control, often struggle to handle dynamic traffic patterns. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive TSC framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL), using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to minimize total queue lengths across all signal phases. The challenge of efficiently representing highly stochastic traffic conditions for an RL controller is addressed through multiple state representations, including an expanded state space, an autoencoder representation, and a K-Planes-inspired representation. The proposed algorithm has been implemented using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator and demonstrates superior performance over both traditional methods and other conventional RL-based approaches in reducing queue lengths. The best performing configuration achieves an approximately 29% reduction in average queue lengths compared to the traditional Webster method. Furthermore, comparative evaluation of alternative reward formulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed queue-based approach, showcasing the potential for scalable and adaptive urban traffic management.</p></details> |  |

Control-plane procedures involve complex interactions across multiple Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), while the user plane must sustain diverse and resource-intensive traffic. Existing tools often benchmark these dimensions in isolation, rely on synthetic workloads, or lack visibility into fine-grained resource usage. This paper presents 5GC-Bench, a modular framework for stress-testing the 5GC under realistic workloads. 5GC-Bench jointly emulates signaling and service traffic, supporting both VNF profiling and end-to-end service-chain analysis. By characterizing bottlenecks and resource demands, it provides actionable insights for capacity planning and performance optimization. We integrated 5GC-Bench with the OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5GC and deployed it on a real 5G testbed, demonstrating its ability to uncover resource constraints and expose cross-VNF dependencies under scenarios that mirror operational 5G deployments. To foster reproducibility and further research, we release publicly all the artifacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis of an Architecture for Integrated Sensing and Communication in 5G OpenRAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16917v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper analyzes the functional requirements and architectural considerations for Integrated Sensing and Communication ( ISAC) in a 5G Open Radio Access Network (OpenRAN) environment, with emphasis on secure and modular deployment. Focusing on a mono-static, half-duplex sensing approach, it evaluates radar setup options, signal types, and processing placement within the Radio Access Network ( RAN), considering performance and security implications. The proposed architecture minimizes hardware modifications by leveraging sniffer Radio Units (RU s) and existing OpenRAN fronthaul interfaces, while protecting sensitive In-phase and Quadrature (I/Q) data and control traffic against potential attacks. Security threats, such as passive sensing, spoofing, and privacy violations, are mapped to mitigation strategies within the OpenRAN framework. The result is a deployment blueprint applicable to both Public Land Mobile Networks ( PLMNs) and Non-Public Networks (NPNs), supporting future 6G ISAC capabilities in a standards-compliant manner.</p></details> | 2 figures, 2 tables |
| **[End-to-End Co-Simulation Testbed for Cybersecurity Research and Development in Intelligent Transportation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16489v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have been widely deployed across major metropolitan regions worldwide to improve roadway safety, optimize traffic flow, and reduce environmental impacts. These systems integrate advanced sensors, communication networks, and data analytics to enable real-time traffic monitoring, adaptive signal control, and predictive maintenance. However, such integration significantly broadens the ITS attack surface, exposing critical infrastructures to cyber threats that jeopardize safety, data integrity, and operational resilience. Ensuring robust cybersecurity is therefore essential, yet comprehensive vulnerability assessments, threat modeling, and mitigation validations are often cost-prohibitive and time-intensive when applied to large-scale, heterogeneous transportation systems. Simulation platforms offer a cost-effective and repeatable means for cybersecurity evaluation, and the simulation platform should encompass the full range of ITS dimensions - mobility, sensing, networking, and applications. This chapter discusses an integrated co-simulation testbed that links CARLA for 3D environment and sensor modeling, SUMO for microscopic traffic simulation and control, and OMNeT++ for V2X communication simulation. The co-simulation testbed enables end-to-end experimentation, vulnerability identification, and mitigation benchmarking, providing practical insights for developing secure, efficient, and resilient ITS infrastructures. To illustrate its capabilities, the chapter incorporates a case study on a C-V2X proactive safety alert system enhanced with post-quantum cryptography, highlighting the role of the testbed in advancing secure and resilient ITS infrastructures.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Distribution Shift Problem in Transportation Networks using Reinforcement Learning and AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15291v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart transportation networks has increased significantly in the last few years. Among these ML and AI approaches, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to be a very promising approach by several authors. However, a problem with using Reinforcement Learning in Traffic Signal Control is the reliability of the trained RL agents due to the dynamically changing distribution of the input data with respect to the distribution of the data used for training. This presents a major challenge and a reliability problem for the trained network of AI agents and could have very undesirable and even detrimental consequences if a suitable solution is not found. Several researchers have tried to address this problem using different approaches. In particular, Meta Reinforcement Learning (Meta RL) promises to be an effective solution. In this paper, we evaluate and analyze a state-of-the-art Meta RL approach called MetaLight and show that, while under certain conditions MetaLight can indeed lead to reasonably good results, under some other conditions it might not perform well (with errors of up to 22%), suggesting that Meta RL schemes are often not robust enough and can even pose major reliability problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic Co-Simulation Framework Empowered by Infrastructure Camera Sensing and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03925v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic simulations are commonly used to optimize urban traffic flow, with reinforcement learning (RL) showing promising potential for automated traffic signal control, particularly in intelligent transportation systems involving connected automated vehicles. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is particularly effective for learning control strategies for traffic lights in a network using iterative simulations. However, existing methods often assume perfect vehicle detection, which overlooks real-world limitations related to infrastructure availability and sensor reliability. This study proposes a co-simulation framework integrating CARLA and SUMO, which combines high-fidelity 3D modeling with large-scale traffic flow simulation. Cameras mounted on traffic light poles within the CARLA environment use a YOLO-based computer vision system to detect and count vehicles, providing real-time traffic data as input for adaptive signal control in SUMO. MARL agents trained with four different reward structures leverage this visual feedback to optimize signal timings and improve network-wide traffic flow. Experiments in a multi-intersection test-bed demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MARL approach in enhancing traffic conditions using real-time camera based detection. The framework also evaluates the robustness of MARL under faulty or sparse sensing and compares the performance of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for vehicle detection. Results show that while better accuracy improves performance, MARL agents can still achieve significant improvements with imperfect detection, demonstrating scalability and adaptability for real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiLight: A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework with Global Adversarial Guidance for Large-Scale Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14391v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is essential for mitigating urban congestion, yet existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods face challenges in scaling to large networks while maintaining global coordination. Centralized RL suffers from scalability issues, while decentralized approaches often lack unified objectives, resulting in limited network-level efficiency. In this paper, we propose HiLight, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with global adversarial guidance for large-scale TSC. HiLight consists of a high-level Meta-Policy, which partitions the traffic network into subregions and generates sub-goals using a Transformer-LSTM architecture, and a low-level Sub-Policy, which controls individual intersections with global awareness. To improve the alignment between global planning and local execution, we introduce an adversarial training mechanism, where the Meta-Policy generates challenging yet informative sub-goals, and the Sub-Policy learns to surpass these targets, leading to more effective coordination. We evaluate HiLight across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and additionally construct a large-scale Manhattan network with diverse traffic conditions, including peak transitions, adverse weather, and holiday surges. Experimental results show that HiLight exhibits significant advantages in large-scale scenarios and remains competitive across standard benchmarks of varying sizes.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we develop mmTunnel, a millimeter-wave radar system that achieves far-range vehicle detection in tunnels. The main challenge here is coping with ghost points caused by multi-path reflections, which lead to severe localization errors and false alarms. Instead of merely removing ghost points, we propose correcting them to true vehicle positions by recovering their signal reflection paths, thus reserving more data points and improving detection performance, even in occlusion scenarios. However, recovering complex 3D reflection paths from limited 2D radar points is highly challenging. To address this problem, we develop a multi-path ray tracing algorithm that leverages the ground plane constraint and identifies the most probable reflection path based on signal path loss and spatial distance. We also introduce a curve-to-plane segmentation method to simplify tunnel surface modeling such that we can significantly reduce the computational delay and achieve real-time processing. We have evaluated mmTunnel with comprehensive experiments. In two test tunnels, we conducted controlled experiments in various scenarios with cars and trucks. Our system achieves an average F1 score of 93.7% for vehicle detection while maintaining real-time processing. Even in the challenging occlusion scenarios, the F1 score remains above 91%. Moreover, we collected extensive data from a public tunnel with heavy traffic at times and show our method could achieve an F1 score of 91.5% in real-world traffic conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 25 figures, to appear in ACM MobiCom 2025</p></details> |
| **[EvolveSignal: A Large Language Model Powered Coding Agent for Discovering Traffic Signal Control Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03335v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator) and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers. This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Traffic Signal Control with Predictable Cycle Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03118v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile, the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the best performance over all datasets against baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, limited by the quality of offline datasets, it generally fails to learn well-qualified policies in suboptimal datasets. To address datasets with insufficient optimal demonstrations, we introduce Goal-cOnditioned Data Augmentation (GODA), a novel goal-conditioned diffusion-based method for augmenting samples with higher quality. Leveraging recent advancements in generative modelling, GODA incorporates a novel return-oriented goal condition with various selection mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a controllable scaling technique to provide enhanced return-based guidance during data sampling. GODA learns a comprehensive distribution representation of the original offline datasets while generating new data with selectively higher-return goals, thereby maximizing the utility of limited optimal demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a novel adaptive gated conditioning method for processing noisy inputs and conditions, enhancing the capture of goal-oriented guidance. We conduct experiments on the D4RL benchmark and real-world challenges, specifically traffic signal control (TSC) tasks, to demonstrate GODA's effectiveness in enhancing data quality and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art data augmentation methods across various offline RL algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cruise Control: Dynamic Model Selection for ML-Based Network Traffic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15146v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern networks increasingly rely on machine learning models for real-time insights, including traffic classification, application quality of experience inference, and intrusion detection. However, existing approaches prioritize prediction accuracy without considering deployment constraints or the dynamism of network traffic, leading to potentially suboptimal performance. Because of this, deploying ML models in real-world networks with tight performance constraints remains an open challenge. In contrast with existing work that aims to select an optimal candidate model for each task based on offline information, we propose an online, system-driven approach to dynamically select the best ML model for network traffic analysis. To this end, we present Cruise Control, a system that pre-trains several models for a given task with different accuracy-cost tradeoffs and selects the most appropriate model based on lightweight signals representing the system's current traffic processing ability. Experimental results using two real-world traffic analysis tasks demonstrate Cruise Control's effectiveness in adapting to changing network conditions. Our evaluation shows that Cruise Control improves median accuracy by 2.78% while reducing packet loss by a factor of four compared to offline-selected models.</p></details> |  |

This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC25')</p></details> |

Contextual MARL (cMARL) addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts. Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at https://github.com/DaRL-LibSignal/cMALC-D.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A shorter version has been accepted to the 2025 Conference on Information and Knowledge Management</p></details> |

At the core of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals, autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems. Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA, and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks. The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.</p></details> |  |

In particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency function representation can significantly improve the performance of the learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal control policies.</p></details> |  |

The literature has effectively tackled such a problem, mostly with automated planning techniques leveraging the PDDL+ language and solvers. However, such language has limitations when it comes to specifying optimisation statements and computing optimal plans. In this paper, we provide an alternative solution to the traffic signal optimisation problem based on Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP). We devise an encoding in a CASP language, which is then solved by means of clingcon 3, a system extending the well-known ASP solver clingo. We performed experiments on real historical data from the town of Huddersfield in the UK, comparing our approach to the PDDL+ model that obtained the best results for the considered benchmark. The results showed the potential of our approach for tackling the traffic signal optimisation problem and improving the solution quality of the PDDL+ plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), Proceedings of ICLP 2025</p></details> |

However, the implementation of this technology has been largely limited to laboratory settings, with few real-world applications. We developed a bimanual BCI system to drive a vehicle in both simulated and real-world environments. We demonstrate that an individual with tetraplegia, implanted with intracortical BCI electrodes in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the hand knob region of the motor cortex (MC), reacts at least as fast and precisely as motor intact participants, and drives a simulated vehicle as proficiently as the same control group. This BCI participant, living in California, could also remotely drive a Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle in Michigan. Our first teledriving task relied on cursor control for speed and steering in a closed urban test facility. However, the final BCI system added click control for full-stop braking and thus enabled bimanual cursor-and-click control for both simulated driving through a virtual town with traffic and teledriving through an obstacle course without traffic in the real world. We also demonstrate the safety and feasibility of BCI-controlled driving. This first-of-its-kind implantable BCI application not only highlights the versatility and innovative potentials of BCIs but also illuminates the promising future for the development of life-changing solutions to restore independence to those who suffer catastrophic neurological injury.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 7 figures, 1 table. 22 supplementary pages, 6 supplementary figures, 11 supplementary tables, 9 supplementary movies available as ancillary files</p></details> |
| **[Combat Urban Congestion via Collaboration: Heterogeneous GNN-based MARL for Coordinated Platooning and Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10948v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a popular approach to develop signal control and vehicle platooning strategies either independently or in a hierarchical way. However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Signal Coordination and Control System Using a Hybrid Model-based and Reinforcement Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20102v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal control in urban corridors faces the dual challenge of maintaining arterial traffic progression while adapting to demand variations at local intersections. We propose a hierarchical traffic signal coordination and control scheme that integrates model-based optimization with reinforcement learning. The system consists of: (i) a High-Level Coordinator (HLC) that selects coordination strategies based on observed and predicted demand; (ii) a Corridor Coordinator that derives phase constraints from the selected strategy-either Max-Flow Coordination (MFC) or Green-Wave Coordination (GWC); and (iii) Hybrid Signal Agents (HSAs) that determine signal phases via reinforcement learning with action masking to enforce feasibility. Hierarchical reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to train HSA and HLC policies. At the lower level, three HSA policies-MFC-aware, GWC-aware, and pure agent control (PAC) are trained in conjunction with their respective coordination strategies. At the higher level, the HLC is trained to dynamically switch strategies using a multi-objective reward balancing corridor-level and network-wide performance. The proposed scheme was developed and evaluated on a SUMO-RLlib platform. Case results show that hybrid MFC maximizes throughput under heavy demand; hybrid GWC consistently minimizes arterial stops and maintains progression across diverse traffic conditions but can reduce network-wide efficiency; and PAC improves network-wide travel time in moderate demand but is less effective under heavy demand. The hierarchical design enables adaptive strategy selection, achieving robust performance across all demand levels.</p></details> | 28 pages, 7 figures |

Deploying interpretable surrogates of uninterpretable policies enhances the safety and verifiability of MARL for real-world applications. However, if these surrogates are to interact directly with the environment within human supervisory frameworks, they must be both performant and computationally efficient. Prior work on interpretable MARL has either sacrificed performance for computational efficiency or computational efficiency for performance. To address this issue, we propose HYDRAVIPER, a decision tree-based interpretable MARL algorithm. HYDRAVIPER coordinates training between agents based on expected team performance, and adaptively allocates budgets for environment interaction to improve computational efficiency. Experiments on standard benchmark environments for multi-agent coordination and traffic signal control show that HYDRAVIPER matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods using a fraction of the runtime, and that it maintains a Pareto frontier of performance for different interaction budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 2 tables; 12 figures; accepted version, published at the 8th AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics and Society (AIES '25)</p></details> |

Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

Nevertheless, the complete potential of Green Wave systems has yet to be explored. Utilizing emerging technologies and advanced algorithms, such as AI or V2X, would aid in achieving more robust traffic management strategies, especially when integrated with Green Wave. This work comprehensively surveys existing traffic control strategies that enable Green Waves and analyzes their impact on future traffic management systems and urban infrastructure. Understanding previous research on traffic management and its effect on traffic efficiency and safety helps explore the integration of Green Wave solutions with smart city initiatives for effective traffic signal coordination. This paper also discusses the advantages of using Green Wave strategies for emission reduction and considers road safety issues for vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists. Finally, the existing challenges and research gaps in building robust and successful Green Wave systems are discussed to articulate explicitly the future requirement of sustainable urban transport.</p></details> |  |

Autonomous driving technologies have emerged as a potential solution. Among traffic control methods, reinforcement learning has shown superior performance over traffic signals in various scenarios. However, prior research has largely focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections, leaving large-scale mixed traffic control largely unexplored. This study presents the first attempt to use decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning for large-scale mixed traffic control in which some intersections are managed by traffic signals and others by robot vehicles. Evaluating a real-world network in Colorado Springs, CO, USA with 14 intersections, we measure traffic efficiency via average waiting time of vehicles at intersections and the number of vehicles reaching their destinations within a time window (i.e., throughput). At 80% RV penetration rate, our method reduces waiting time from 6.17s to 5.09s and increases throughput from 454 vehicles per 500 seconds to 493 vehicles per 500 seconds, outperforming the baseline of fully signalized intersections. These findings suggest that integrating reinforcement learning-based control large-scale traffic can improve overall efficiency and may inform future urban planning strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task.

OpenCAMS is designed to support advanced research in transportation safety, mobility, and cybersecurity by combining the strengths of each simulation domain. Specifically, SUMO provides large-scale, microscopic traffic modeling; CARLA offers high-fidelity 3D perception, vehicle dynamics, and control simulation; and OMNeT++ enables modular, event-driven network communication, such as cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X). OpenCAMS employs a time-synchronized, bidirectional coupling architecture that ensures coherent simulation progression across traffic, perception, and communication domains while preserving modularity and reproducibility. For example, CARLA can simulate and render a subset of vehicles that require detailed sensor emulation and control logic; SUMO orchestrates network-wide traffic flow, vehicle routing, and traffic signal management; and OMNeT++ dynamically maps communication nodes to both mobile entities (e.g., vehicles) and static entities (e.g., roadside units) to enable C-V2X communication. While these three simulators form the foundational core of OpenCAMS, the platform is designed to be expandable and future-proof, allowing additional simulators to be integrated on top of this core without requiring fundamental changes to the system architecture. The OpenCAMS platform is fully open-source and publicly available through its GitHub repository https://github.com/minhaj6/carla-sumo-omnetpp-cosim, providing the research community with an accessible, flexible, and collaborative environment for advancing next-generation intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |

This study explores how robot vehicles (RVs) can enhance heterogeneous traffic flow, particularly at unsignalized intersections where traditional methods fail during power outages. Using reinforcement learning (RL) and real-world data, we simulate mixed traffic at complex intersections with RV penetration rates ranging from 10% to 90%. Results show that average waiting times drop by up to 86% and 91% compared to signalized and unsignalized intersections, respectively. We observe a "rarity advantage," where less frequent vehicles benefit the most (up to 87%). Although CO2 emissions and fuel consumption increase with RV penetration, they remain well below those of traditional signalized traffic. Decreased space headways also indicate more efficient road usage. These findings highlight RVs' potential to improve traffic efficiency and reduce environmental impact in complex, heterogeneous settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers an adaptive method for TSC by responding to dynamic traffic patterns, with multi-agent RL (MARL) gaining traction as intersections naturally function as coordinated agents. However, due to shifts in environmental dynamics, implementing MARL-based TSC policies in the real world often leads to a significant performance drop, known as the sim-to-real gap. Grounded Action Transformation (GAT) has successfully mitigated this gap in single-agent RL for TSC, but real-world traffic networks, which involve numerous interacting intersections, are better suited to a MARL framework. In this work, we introduce JL-GAT, an application of GAT to MARL-based TSC that balances scalability with enhanced grounding capability by incorporating information from neighboring agents. JL-GAT adopts a decentralized approach to GAT, allowing for the scalability often required in real-world traffic networks while still capturing key interactions between agents. Comprehensive experiments on various road networks under simulated adverse weather conditions, along with ablation studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of JL-GAT.

Of particular concern -- and the focus of this paper -- are cases where attackers reroute domestic traffic through foreign countries, exposing it to surveillance, bypassing legal privacy protections, and posing national security threats. Efforts to detect and mitigate such attacks have focused primarily on the control plane while data-plane signals remain largely overlooked. In particular, change in propagation delay caused by rerouting offers a promising signal: the change is unavoidable and the increased propagation delay is directly observable from the affected networks. In this paper, we explore the practicality of using delay variations for hijack detection, addressing two key questions: (1) What coverage can this provide, given its heavy dependence on the geolocations of the sender, receiver, and adversary? and (2) Can an always-on latency-based detection system be deployed without disrupting normal network operations? We observe that for 86% of victim-attacker country pairs in the world, mid-attack delays exceed pre-attack delays by at least 25% in real deployments, making delay-based hijack detection promising. To demonstrate practicality, we design HiDe, which reliably detects delay surges from long-distance hijacks at line rate. We measure HiDe's accuracy and false-positive rate on real-world data and validate it with ethically conducted hijacks.</p></details> |  |

However, the traditional methods rely on standard graph structures often fail to capture the intricate higher-order spatio-temporal correlations inherent in real-world traffic dynamics. Standard graphs cannot fully represent the spatial relationships within road networks, which limits the effectiveness of graph-based approaches. In contrast, directed hypergraphs provide more accurate representation of spatial information to model complex directed relationships among multiple nodes. In this paper, we propose DHLight, a novel multi-agent policy-based framework that synergistically integrates directed hypergraph learning module.

Traditionally, methods such as manual counting, loop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been used for TMC estimation. Although generally reliable, camera-based TMC estimation is prone to inaccuracies under poor lighting conditions during harsh weather and nighttime. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology is gaining popularity in recent times due to reduced costs and its expanding use in 3D object detection, tracking, and related applications. This paper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a dual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC estimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to classify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and vehicle classes. This work discusses the estimated TMC results and provides insights into the observed trends and irregularities. Potential improvements are also discussed that could enhance not only TMC estimation, but also trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 8 Figures.

| **[Multi-residual Mixture of Experts Learning for Cooperative Control in Multi-vehicle Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09836v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming increasingly popular, with their applications now extending beyond just a mode of transportation to serving as mobile actuators of a traffic flow to control flow dynamics. This contrasts with traditional fixed-location actuators, such as traffic signals, and is referred to as Lagrangian traffic control. However, designing effective Lagrangian traffic control policies for AVs that generalize across traffic scenarios introduces a major challenge. Real-world traffic environments are highly diverse, and developing policies that perform robustly across such diverse traffic scenarios is challenging. It is further compounded by the joint complexity of the multi-agent nature of traffic systems, mixed motives among participants, and conflicting optimization objectives subject to strict physical and external constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Residual Mixture of Expert Learning (MRMEL), a novel framework for Lagrangian traffic control that augments a given suboptimal nominal policy with a learned residual while explicitly accounting for the structure of the traffic scenario space. In particular, taking inspiration from residual reinforcement learning, MRMEL augments a suboptimal nominal AV control policy by learning a residual correction, but at the same time dynamically selects the most suitable nominal policy from a pool of nominal policies conditioned on the traffic scenarios and modeled as a mixture of experts. We validate MRMEL using a case study in cooperative eco-driving at signalized intersections in Atlanta, Dallas Fort Worth, and Salt Lake City, with real-world data-driven traffic scenarios. The results show that MRMEL consistently yields superior performance-achieving an additional 4%-9% reduction in aggregate vehicle emissions relative to the strongest baseline in each setting.</p></details> |  |

The SUs can reshape their traffic demands by modifying the semantic extraction factor, while the RIS can reconfigure the channel conditions via the passive beamforming. This provides the AP with greater flexibility to decode the superimposed signals from the SUs. We aim to minimize the system's overall energy consumption, while ensuring that each SU's traffic demand is satisfied. Hence, we formulate a joint optimization problem of the SUs' decoding order and semantic control, as well as the RIS's passive beamforming strategy. This problem is intractable due to the complicated coupling in constraints. To solve this, we decompose the original problem into two subproblems and solve them by using a series of approximate methods. Numerical results show that the joint traffic reshaping and channel reconfiguration scheme significantly improves the energy saving performance of the NOMA transmissions compared to the benchmark methods.</p></details> |  |

When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT) results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS) software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan. Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300 plan descriptions.

| **[Design Tasks and Their Complexity for the European Train Control System with Hybrid Train Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02572v5)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Railway networks have become increasingly important in recent times, especially in moving freight and public transportation from road traffic and planes to more environmentally friendly trains. Since expanding the global railway network is time- and resource-consuming, maximizing the rail capacity of the existing infrastructure is desirable. However, simply running more trains is infeasible as certain constraints enforced by the train control system must be satisfied. The capacity of a network depends (amongst others) on the distance between trains allowed by this safety system. While most signaling systems rely on fixed blocks defined by costly hardware, new specifications provided by Level 2 with Hybrid Train Detection of the European Train Control System (ETCS L2 HTD), formerly known as ETCS Hybrid Level 3, allow the usage of virtual subsections. This additional degree of freedom allows for shorter train following times and, thus, more trains on existing railway tracks. On the other hand, new design tasks arise on which automated methods might be helpful for designers of modern railway networks. However, although first approaches exist that solve design problems arising within ETCS L2 HTD, neither formal descriptions nor results on the computational complexity of the corresponding design tasks exist. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing a formal description of design tasks for ETCS L2 HTD and proof that these tasks are NP-complete or NP-hard, respectively. By that, we are providing a solid basis for the future development of methods to solve those tasks, which will be integrated into the Munich Train Control Toolkit available open-source on GitHub at https://github.com/cda-tum/mtct.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted Version: EURO Journal on Transportation and Logistics; ORCIDs updated</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Traffic Signal Control based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Case Study on a simulated real-world corridor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02189v4)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies that have formulated multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for adaptive traffic signal control have primarily used value-based RL methods. However, recent literature has shown that policy-based methods may perform better in partially observable environments. Additionally, RL methods remain largely untested for real-world normally signal timing plans because of the simplifying assumptions common in the literature. The current study attempts to address these gaps and formulates a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO) algorithm to implement adaptive and coordinated traffic control along an arterial corridor. The formulated MA-PPO has a centralized-critic architecture under a centralized training and decentralized execution framework. Agents are designed to allow selection and implementation of up to eight signal phases, as commonly implemented in field controllers. The formulated algorithm is tested on a simulated real-world seven intersection corridor. The speed of convergence for each agent was found to depend on the size of the action space, which depends on the number and sequence of signal phases. The performance of the formulated MA-PPO adaptive control algorithm is compared with the field implemented actuated-coordinated signal control (ASC), modeled using PTV-Vissim-MaxTime software in the loop simulation (SILs). The trained MA-PPO performed significantly better than the ASC for all movements. Compared to ASC the MA-PPO showed 2% and 24% improvements in travel time in the primary and secondary coordination directions, respectively. For cross streets movements MA-PPO also showed significant crossing time reductions. Volume sensitivity experiments revealed that the formulated MA-PPO demonstrated good stability, robustness, and adaptability to changes in traffic demand.</p></details> |  |
| **[Overtake Detection in Trucks Using CAN Bus Signals: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00593v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe overtaking manoeuvres in trucks are vital for preventing accidents and ensuring efficient traffic flow. Accurate prediction of such manoeuvres is essential for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to make timely and informed decisions. In this study, we focus on overtake detection using Controller Area Network (CAN) bus data collected from five in-service trucks provided by the Volvo Group. We evaluate three common classifiers for vehicle manoeuvre detection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and analyse how different preprocessing configurations affect performance. We find that variability in traffic conditions strongly influences the signal patterns, particularly in the no-overtake class, affecting classification performance if training data lacks adequate diversity. Since the data were collected under unconstrained, real-world conditions, class diversity cannot be guaranteed a priori. However, training with data from multiple vehicles improves generalisation and reduces condition-specific bias. Our pertruck analysis also reveals that classification accuracy, especially for overtakes, depends on the amount of training data per vehicle. To address this, we apply a score-level fusion strategy, which yields the best per-truck performance across most cases. Overall, we achieve an accuracy via fusion of TNR=93% (True Negative Rate) and TPR=86.5% (True Positive Rate). This research has been part of the BIG FUN project, which explores how Artificial Intelligence can be applied to logged vehicle data to understand and predict driver behaviour, particularly in relation to Camera Monitor Systems (CMS), being introduced as digital replacements for traditional exterior mirrors.</p></details> | Under review at ESWA |
| **[Learning Traffic Signal Control via Genetic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17328v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The control of traffic signals is crucial for improving transportation efficiency. Recently, learning-based methods, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), garnered substantial success in the quest for more efficient traffic signal control strategies. However, the design of rewards in DRL highly demands domain knowledge to converge to an effective policy, and the final policy also presents difficulties in terms of explainability. In this work, a new learning-based method for signal control in complex intersections is proposed. In our approach, we design a concept of phase urgency for each signal phase. During signal transitions, the traffic light control strategy selects the next phase to be activated based on the phase urgency. We then proposed to represent the urgency function as an explainable tree structure. The urgency function can calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. Genetic programming is adopted to perform gradient-free optimization of the urgency function. We test our algorithm on multiple public traffic signal control datasets. The experimental results indicate that the tree-shaped urgency function evolved by genetic programming outperforms the baselines, including a state-of-the-art method in the transportation field and a well-known DRL-based method. Our code is available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustness of Reinforcement Learning-Based Traffic Signal Control under Incidents: A Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13836v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning-based traffic signal control (RL-TSC) has emerged as a promising approach for improving urban mobility. However, its robustness under real-world disruptions such as traffic incidents remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce T-REX, an open-source, SUMO-based simulation framework for training and evaluating RL-TSC methods under dynamic, incident scenarios. T-REX models realistic network-level performance considering drivers' probabilistic rerouting, speed adaptation, and contextual lane-changing, enabling the simulation of congestion propagation under incidents. To assess robustness, we propose a suite of metrics that extend beyond conventional traffic efficiency measures. Through extensive experiments across synthetic and real-world networks, we showcase T-REX for the evaluation of several state-of-the-art RL-TSC methods under multiple real-world deployment paradigms. Our findings show that while independent value-based and decentralized pressure-based methods offer fast convergence and generalization in stable traffic conditions and homogeneous networks, their performance degrades sharply under incident-driven distribution shifts. In contrast, hierarchical coordination methods tend to offer more stable and adaptable performance in large-scale, irregular networks, benefiting from their structured decision-making architecture. However, this comes with the trade-off of slower convergence and higher training complexity. These findings highlight the need for robustness-aware design and evaluation in RL-TSC research. T-REX contributes to this effort by providing an open, standardized and reproducible platform for benchmarking RL methods under dynamic and disruptive traffic scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Topology-Assisted Spatio-Temporal Pattern Disentangling for Scalable MARL in Large-scale Autonomous Traffic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12453v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) have emerged as a promising solution towards ameliorating urban traffic congestion, with Traffic Signal Control (TSC) identified as a critical component. Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms have shown potential in optimizing TSC through real-time decision-making, their scalability and effectiveness often suffer from large-scale and complex environments. Typically, these limitations primarily stem from a fundamental mismatch between the exponential growth of the state space driven by the environmental heterogeneities and the limited modeling capacity of current solutions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel MARL framework that integrates Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), aiming to enhance the expressiveness of environmental representations and improve agent coordination. Furthermore, inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs), a topology-assisted spatial pattern disentangling (TSD)-enhanced MoE is proposed, which leverages topological signatures to decouple graph features for specialized processing, thus improving the model's ability to characterize dynamic and heterogeneous local observations. The TSD module is also integrated into the policy and value networks of the Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, further improving decision-making efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world traffic scenarios, together with comprehensive theoretical analysis, validate the superior performance of the proposed framework, highlighting the model's scalability and effectiveness in addressing the complexities of large-scale TSC tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Regulating Cars: Automating Traffic Control in Free Flow Road Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11973v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Free-flow road networks, such as suburban highways, are increasingly experiencing traffic congestion due to growing commuter inflow and limited infrastructure. Traditional control mechanisms, such as traffic signals or local heuristics, are ineffective or infeasible in these high-speed, signal-free environments. We introduce self-regulating cars, a reinforcement learning-based traffic control protocol that dynamically modulates vehicle speeds to optimize throughput and prevent congestion, without requiring new physical infrastructure. Our approach integrates classical traffic flow theory, gap acceptance models, and microscopic simulation into a physics-informed RL framework. By abstracting roads into super-segments, the agent captures emergent flow dynamics and learns robust speed modulation policies from instantaneous traffic observations. Evaluated in the high-fidelity PTV Vissim simulator on a real-world highway network, our method improves total throughput by 5%, reduces average delay by 13%, and decreases total stops by 3% compared to the no-control setting. It also achieves smoother, congestion-resistant flow while generalizing across varied traffic patterns, demonstrating its potential for scalable, ML-driven traffic management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Learning for Reliable and Timely Communication in 6G Industrial Subnetworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11749v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging 6G industrial networks envision autonomous in-X subnetworks to support efficient and cost-effective short range, localized connectivity for autonomous control operations. Supporting timely transmission of event-driven, critical control traffic is challenging in such networks is challenging due to limited radio resources, dynamic device activity, and high mobility. In this paper, we propose a distributed, learning-based random access protocol that establishes implicit inter-subnetwork coordination to minimize the collision probability and improves timely delivery. Each subnetwork independently learns and selects access configurations based on a contention signature signal broadcast by a central access point, enabling adaptive, collision-aware access under dynamic traffic and mobility conditions. The proposed approach features lightweight neural models and online training, making it suitable for deployment in constrained industrial subnetworks. Simulation results show that our method significantly improves the probability of timely packet delivery compared to baseline methods, particularly in dense and high-load scenarios. For instance, our proposed method achieves 21% gain in the probability of timely packet delivery compared to a classical Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) for an industrial setting of 60 subnetworks and 5 radio channels.</p></details> |  |

Because heuristic- or pattern-detection-based controllers struggle with the stochastic and combinatorial nature of dispatching, we model the six-elevator, fifteen-floor system at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as a Markov Decision Process and train an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) Elevator Group Control System (EGCS). Key innovations include a novel action space encoding to handle the combinatorial complexity of elevator dispatching, the introduction of infra-steps to model continuous passenger arrivals, and a tailored reward signal to improve learning efficiency. In addition, we explore various ways to adapt the discounting factor to the infra-step formulation. We investigate RL architectures based on Dueling Double Deep Q-learning, showing that the proposed RL-based EGCS adapts to fluctuating traffic patterns, learns from a highly stochastic environment, and thereby outperforms a traditional rule-based algorithm.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Space-O-RAN: Enabling Intelligent, Open, and Interoperable Non Terrestrial Networks in 6G](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15936v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite networks are rapidly evolving, yet most \glspl{ntn} remain isolated from terrestrial orchestration frameworks. Their control architectures are typically monolithic and static, limiting their adaptability to dynamic traffic, topology changes, and mission requirements. These constraints lead to inefficient spectrum use and underutilized network capacity. Although \gls{ai} promises automation, its deployment in orbit is limited by computing, energy, and connectivity limitations. This paper introduces Space-O-RAN, a distributed control architecture that extends Open RAN principles into satellite constellations through hierarchical, closed-loop control. Lightweight \glspl{dapp} operate onboard satellites, enabling real-time functions like scheduling and beam steering without relying on persistent ground access. Cluster-level coordination is managed via \glspl{spaceric}, which leverage low-latency \glspl{isl} for autonomous decisions in orbit. Strategic tasks, including AI training and policy updates, are transferred to terrestrial platforms \glspl{smo} using digital twins and feeder links. A key enabler is the dynamic mapping of the O-RAN interfaces to satellite links, supporting adaptive signaling under varying conditions. Simulations using the Starlink topology validate the latency bounds that inform this architectural split, demonstrating both feasibility and scalability for autonomous satellite RAN operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeAuto: Knowledge-Enhanced Safe Autonomous Driving with Multimodal Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00211v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional autonomous driving systems often struggle to connect high-level reasoning with low-level control, leading to suboptimal and sometimes unsafe behaviors. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which process both visual and textual data, offer an opportunity to unify perception and reasoning. However, effectively embedding precise safety knowledge into MLLMs for autonomous driving remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose SafeAuto, a framework that enhances MLLM-based autonomous driving by incorporating both unstructured and structured knowledge. First, we introduce a Position-Dependent Cross-Entropy (PDCE) loss to improve low-level control signal predictions when values are represented as text. Second, to explicitly integrate safety knowledge, we develop a reasoning component that translates traffic rules into first-order logic (e.g., "red light $\implies$ stop") and embeds them into a probabilistic graphical model (e.g., Markov Logic Network) to verify predicted actions using recognized environmental attributes. Additionally, our Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model leverages video, control signals, and environmental attributes to learn from past driving experiences. Integrating PDCE, MLN, and Multimodal RAG, SafeAuto outperforms existing baselines across multiple datasets, enabling more accurate, reliable, and safer autonomous driving.

Connected vehicles (CVs) are given right-of-way based on prevailing traffic conditions, such as estimated times of arrival (ETAs) of vehicles, the number of CVs in different approaches, and their emissions. These factors are considered in line with the objectives of the VTL application. Aiming to optimize traffic flow by reducing delays, VTL generates Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) data for CVs approaching an intersection. Our VTL method considers the delay each CV would cause for other CVs if given the right-of-way. However, the stochastic nature of vehicle arrivals at intersections increases the complexity of the optimization problem, making it challenging for classical computers to determine optimal solutions in real-time. To address this limitation, we develop a VTL method designed to minimize stopped delays for CVs at an intersection by leveraging the efficacies of existing quantum computers that determine the best outcome from all possible combinations. This method employs Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), a mathematical framework commonly used in quantum computing, to formulate the VTL problem as a stopped-delay-minimization challenge. To evaluate our method for roadway traffic with varying traffic volumes, we integrate an open-source microscopic roadway traffic simulator, Simulation for Urban Mobility (SUMO), with a cloud-based D-Wave quantum computer. Our analysis reveals that our quantum computing-supported VTL outperforms the classical optimization-based VTL by significantly reducing stopped delays at intersections and travel time through the roadway sections crossing the intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the ACM Transactions on Internet of Things for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Safe, Out-of-Distribution-Adaptive MPC with Conformalized Neural Network Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02436v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SODA-MPC, a Safe, Out-of-Distribution-Adaptive Model Predictive Control algorithm, which uses an ensemble of learned models for prediction, with a runtime monitor to flag unreliable out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions. When an OOD situation is detected, SODA-MPC triggers a safe fallback control strategy based on reachability, yielding a control framework that achieves the high performance of learning-based models while preserving the safety of reachability-based control. We demonstrate the method in the context of an autonomous vehicle, driving among dynamic pedestrians, where SODA-MPC uses a neural network ensemble for pedestrian prediction. We calibrate the OOD signal using conformal prediction to derive an OOD detector with probabilistic guarantees on the false-positive rate, given a user-specified confidence level. During in-distribution operation, the MPC controller avoids collisions with a pedestrian based on the trajectory predicted by the mean of the ensemble. When OOD conditions are detected, the MPC switches to a reachability-based controller to avoid collisions with the reachable set of the pedestrian assuming a maximum pedestrian speed, to guarantee safety under the worst-case actions of the pedestrian. We verify SODA-MPC in extensive autonomous driving simulations in a pedestrian-crossing scenario. Our model ensemble is trained and calibrated with real pedestrian data, showing that our OOD detector obtains the desired accuracy rate within a theoretically-predicted range. We empirically show improved safety and improved task completion compared with two state-of-the-art MPC methods that also use conformal prediction, but without OOD adaptation. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with the large-scale multi-agent predictor Trajectron++, using large-scale traffic data from the nuScenes dataset for training and calibration.</p></details> |  |

However, such tools remain challenging for users due to complex manual workflows involving network download, demand generation, simulation setup, and result analysis. In this paper, we introduce SUMO-MCP, a novel platform that not only wraps SUMO' s core utilities into a unified tool suite but also provides additional auxiliary utilities for common preprocessing and postprocessing tasks. Using SUMO-MCP, users can issue simple natural-language prompts to generate traffic scenarios from OpenStreetMap data, create demand from origin-destination matrices or random patterns, run batch simulations with multiple signal-control strategies, perform comparative analyses with automated reporting, and detect congestion for signal-timing optimization. Furthermore, the platform allows flexible custom workflows by dynamically combining exposed SUMO tools without additional coding. Experiments demonstrate that SUMO-MCP significantly makes traffic simulation more accessible and reliable for researchers. We will release code for SUMO-MCP at https://github.com/ycycycl/SUMO-MCP in the future.</p></details> |  |

At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part of the national security and provide the most valuable service during surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals, there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense area exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc.</p></details> |  |

Improving traffic safety requires realistic and controllable accident simulations. To tackle the problem, we propose Ctrl-Crash, a controllable car crash video generation model that conditions on signals such as bounding boxes, crash types, and an initial image frame. Our approach enables counterfactual scenario generation where minor variations in input can lead to dramatically different crash outcomes. To support fine-grained control at inference time, we leverage classifier-free guidance with independently tunable scales for each conditioning signal. Ctrl-Crash achieves state-of-the-art performance across quantitative video quality metrics (e.g., FVD and JEDi) and qualitative measurements based on a human-evaluation of physical realism and video quality compared to prior diffusion-based methods.</p></details> | Under review |

Recent advancements in techniques allow the exploration of previously unattainable insights of dynamical systems, such as the Sparse Identification of Non-Linear Dynamics (SINDy), overcoming the limitations of more classic methodologies. The latter requires some prior knowledge of an effective library of candidate terms, which is not realistic for a real case study. Using inspiration from fields like traffic density estimation and control theory, we propose a methodology for characterization and performance analysis of calcium delivery in a family of cells. In this work, we compare the performance of the Constrained Regularized Least-Squares Method (CRLSM) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) for system identification and parameter discovery for governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The CRLSM achieves a fairly good parameter estimate and a good data fit when using the learned parameters in the Consensus problem. On the other hand, despite the initial hypothesis, PINNs fail to match the CRLSM performance and, under the current configuration, do not provide fair parameter estimation. However, we have only studied a limited number of PINN architectures, and it is expected that additional hyperparameter tuning, as well as uncertainty quantification, could significantly improve the performance in future works.</p></details> |  |

While traditional engineering methods have made progress, the complexity and dynamism of real-world traffic necessitate more advanced analytical frameworks. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their unprecedented capabilities in natural language understanding, knowledge integration, and reasoning, represent a promising paradigm shift. This paper comprehensively reviews the application and customization of LLMs for enhancing roadway safety and mobility. A key focus is how LLMs are adapted -- via architectural, training, prompting, and multimodal strategies -- to bridge the "modality gap" with transportation's unique spatio-temporal and physical data. The review systematically analyzes diverse LLM applications in mobility (e.g., traffic flow prediction, signal control) and safety (e.g., crash analysis, driver behavior assessment,). Enabling technologies such as V2X integration, domain-specific foundation models, explainability frameworks, and edge computing are also examined. Despite significant potential, challenges persist regarding inherent LLM limitations (hallucinations, reasoning deficits), data governance (privacy, bias), deployment complexities (sim-to-real, latency), and rigorous safety assurance. Promising future research directions are highlighted, including advanced multimodal fusion, enhanced spatio-temporal reasoning, human-AI collaboration, continuous learning, and the development of efficient, verifiable systems. This review provides a structured roadmap of current capabilities, limitations, and opportunities, underscoring LLMs' transformative potential while emphasizing the need for responsible innovation to realize safer, more intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep reinforcement learning-based longitudinal control strategy for automated vehicles at signalised intersections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08896v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing an autonomous vehicle control strategy for signalised intersections (SI) is one of the challenging tasks due to its inherently complex decision-making process. This study proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based longitudinal vehicle control strategy at SI. A comprehensive reward function has been formulated with a particular focus on (i) distance headway-based efficiency reward, (ii) decision-making criteria during amber light, and (iii) asymmetric acceleration/ deceleration response, along with the traditional safety and comfort criteria. This reward function has been incorporated with two popular DRL algorithms, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft-Actor Critic (SAC), which can handle the continuous action space of acceleration/deceleration. The proposed models have been trained on the combination of real-world leader vehicle (LV) trajectories and simulated trajectories generated using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. The overall performance of the proposed models has been tested using Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) plots and compared with the real-world trajectory data. The results show that the RL models successfully maintain lower distance headway (i.e., higher efficiency) and jerk compared to human-driven vehicles without compromising safety. Further, to assess the robustness of the proposed models, we evaluated the model performance on diverse safety-critical scenarios, in terms of car-following and traffic signal compliance. Both DDPG and SAC models successfully handled the critical scenarios, while the DDPG model showed smoother action profiles compared to the SAC model. Overall, the results confirm that DRL-based longitudinal vehicle control strategy at SI can help to improve traffic safety, efficiency, and comfort.</p></details> |  |

| **[Predicting Road Surface Anomalies by Visual Tracking of a Preceding Vehicle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04392v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel approach to detect road surface anomalies by visual tracking of a preceding vehicle is proposed. The method is versatile, predicting any kind of road anomalies, such as potholes, bumps, debris, etc., unlike direct observation methods that rely on training visual detectors of those cases. The method operates in low visibility conditions or in dense traffic where the anomaly is occluded by a preceding vehicle. Anomalies are detected predictively, i.e., before a vehicle encounters them, which allows to pre-configure low-level vehicle systems (such as chassis) or to plan an avoidance maneuver in case of autonomous driving. A challenge is that the signal coming from camera-based tracking of a preceding vehicle may be weak and disturbed by camera ego motion due to vibrations affecting the ego vehicle. Therefore, we propose an efficient method to compensate camera pitch rotation by an iterative robust estimator. Our experiments on both controlled setup and normal traffic conditions show that road anomalies can be detected reliably at a distance even in challenging cases where the ego vehicle traverses imperfect road surfaces. The method is effective and performs in real time on standard consumer hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), 2025</p></details> |

GNN models often contain millions of parameters, and like other neural network (NN) models, are often fed only a fraction of the graphs that make up the training dataset in batches to update model parameters. The effect of batching algorithms on training time and model performance has been thoroughly explored for NNs but not yet for GNNs. We analyze two different batching algorithms for graph based models, namely static and dynamic batching for two datasets, the QM9 dataset of small molecules and the AFLOW materials database. Our experiments show that changing the batching algorithm can provide up to a 2.7x speedup, but the fastest algorithm depends on the data, model, batch size, hardware, and number of training steps run. Experiments show that for a select number of combinations of batch size, dataset, and model, significant differences in model learning metrics are observed between static and dynamic batching algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Genes Speak: A Semantic-Guided Framework for Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics Data Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11380v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics enables gene expression profiling with spatial context, offering unprecedented insights into the tissue microenvironment. However, most computational models treat genes as isolated numerical features, ignoring the rich biological semantics encoded in their symbols. This prevents a truly deep understanding of critical biological characteristics. To overcome this limitation, we present SemST, a semantic-guided deep learning framework for spatial transcriptomics data clustering. SemST leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable genes to "speak" through their symbolic meanings, transforming gene sets within each tissue spot into biologically informed embeddings. These embeddings are then fused with the spatial neighborhood relationships captured by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), achieving a coherent integration of biological function and spatial structure. We further introduce the Fine-grained Semantic Modulation (FSM) module to optimally exploit these biological priors. The FSM module learns spot-specific affine transformations that empower the semantic embeddings to perform an element-wise calibration of the spatial features, thus dynamically injecting high-order biological knowledge into the spatial context. Extensive experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets show that SemST achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance. Crucially, the FSM module exhibits plug-and-play versatility, consistently improving the performance when integrated into other baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI'...</summary><p>AAAI'2026 poster paper. 12 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Explicit Multimodal Graph Modeling for Human-Object Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12554v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection, which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork \textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level visual and language features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs. Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Attributed Graph Learning via Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11245v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attributed graphs, typically characterized by irregular topologies and a mix of numerical and categorical attributes, are ubiquitous in diverse domains such as social networks, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics. While graph kernels provide a principled framework for measuring graph similarity, existing kernel methods often struggle to simultaneously capture heterogeneous attribute semantics and neighborhood information in attributed graphs. In this work, we propose the Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernel (NASK), a novel graph kernel designed for attributed graph learning. NASK leverages an exponential transformation of the Gower similarity coefficient to jointly model numerical and categorical features efficiently, and employs star substructures enhanced by Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations to integrate multi-scale neighborhood structural information. We theoretically prove that NASK is positive definite, ensuring compatibility with kernel-based learning frameworks such as SVMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven attributed and four large-scale real-world graph benchmarks. The results demonstrate that NASK consistently achieves superior performance over sixteen state-of-the-art baselines, including nine graph kernels and seven Graph Neural Networks.</p></details> |  |

We draw interest in (i) Machine Learning methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular that of Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Following, we describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes PTM in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. The capability of PTM to estimate unknown underlying distributions can help with tackling heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. Finally, we identify certain open challenges specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Dynamic Deep Graph Learning for Incomplete Multi-View Clustering with Masked Graph Reconstruction Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11181v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevalence of real-world multi-view data makes incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) a crucial research. The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel \textbf{D}ynamic Deep \textbf{G}raph Learning for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{C}lustering with \textbf{M}asked Graph Reconstruction Loss (DGIMVCM). Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization. Finally, a clustering module is constructed and optimized through a pseudo-label self-supervised training mechanism. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of DGIMVCM.</p></details> |  |
| **[SMART: A Surrogate Model for Predicting Application Runtime in Dragonfly Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11111v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Dragonfly network, with its high-radix and low-diameter structure, is a leading interconnect in high-performance computing. A major challenge is workload interference on shared network links. Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) is commonly used to analyze workload interference. However, high-fidelity PDES is computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale or real-time scenarios. Hybrid simulation that incorporates data-driven surrogate models offers a promising alternative, especially for forecasting application runtime, a task complicated by the dynamic behavior of network traffic. We present \ourmodel, a surrogate model that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) to capture both spatial and temporal patterns from port level router data. \ourmodel outperforms existing statistical and machine learning baselines, enabling accurate runtime prediction and supporting efficient hybrid simulation of Dragonfly networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Echoless Label-Based Pre-computation for Memory-Efficient Heterogeneous Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11081v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are widely used for deep learning on heterogeneous graphs. Typical end-to-end HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Pre-computation-based HGNNs address this by performing message passing only once during preprocessing, collecting neighbor information into regular-shaped tensors, which enables efficient mini-batch training. Label-based pre-computation methods collect neighbors' label information but suffer from training label leakage, where a node's own label information propagates back to itself during multi-hop message passing - the echo effect. Existing mitigation strategies are memory-inefficient on large graphs or suffer from compatibility issues with advanced message passing methods. We propose Echoless Label-based Pre-computation (Echoless-LP), which eliminates training label leakage with Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP). PFEP partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation, where nodes in each partition collect label information only from neighbors in other partitions, avoiding echo while remaining memory-efficient and compatible with any message passing method. We also introduce an Asymmetric Partitioning Scheme (APS) and a PostAdjust mechanism to address information loss from partitioning and distributional shifts across partitions. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that Echoless-LP achieves superior performance and maintains memory efficiency compared to baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Flow-Attentional Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06127v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for learning from graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs do not consider the conservation law inherent in graphs associated with a flow of physical resources, such as electrical current in power grids or traffic in transportation networks, which can lead to reduced model performance. To address this, we propose flow attention, which adapts existing graph attention mechanisms to satisfy Kirchhoff$\text{'}$s first law. Furthermore, we discuss how this modification influences the expressivity and identify sets of non-isomorphic graphs that can be discriminated by flow attention but not by standard attention. Through extensive experiments on two flow graph datasets (electronic circuits and power grids) we demonstrate that flow attention enhances the performance of attention-based GNNs on both graph-level classification and regression tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted @ Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR): https://openreview.net/forum?id=tOzg7UxTPD</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Graph Representations with Neighborhood-Contextualized Message-Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11046v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become an indispensable tool for analyzing relational data. In the literature, classical GNNs may be classified into three variants: convolutional, attentional, and message-passing. While the standard message-passing variant is highly expressive, its typical pair-wise messages nevertheless only consider the features of the center node and each neighboring node individually. This design fails to incorporate the rich contextual information contained within the broader local neighborhood, potentially hindering its ability to learn complex relationships within the entire set of neighboring nodes. To address this limitation, this work first formalizes the concept of neighborhood-contextualization, rooted in a key property of the attentional variant. This then serves as the foundation for generalizing the message-passing variant to the proposed neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework. To demonstrate its utility, a simple, practical, and efficient method to parametrize and operationalize NCMP is presented, leading to the development of the proposed Soft-Isomorphic Neighborhood-Contextualized Graph Convolution Network (SINC-GCN). A preliminary analysis on a synthetic binary node classification problem then underscores both the expressivity and efficiency of the proposed GNN architecture. Overall, the paper lays the foundation for the novel NCMP framework as a practical path toward further enhancing the graph representational power of classical GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hypergraph Neural Network with State Space Models for Node Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06587v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention for node classification tasks on graph-structured data. However, traditional GNNs primarily focus on adjacency relationships between nodes, often overlooking the role-based characteristics that can provide complementary insights for learning expressive node representations. Existing frameworks for extracting role-based features are largely unsupervised and often fail to translate effectively into downstream predictive tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a hypergraph neural network with a state space model (HGMN). The model integrates role-aware representations into GNNs by combining hypergraph construction with state-space modeling in a principled manner. HGMN employs hypergraph construction techniques to capture higher-order relationships and leverages a learnable mamba transformer mechanism to fuse role-based and adjacency-based embeddings. By exploring two distinct hypergraph construction strategies, degree-based and neighborhood-based, the framework reinforces connectivity among nodes with structural similarity, thereby enriching the learned representations. Furthermore, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution layers enables the model to account for complex dependencies within hypergraph structures. To alleviate the over-smoothing problem encountered in deeper networks, we incorporate residual connections, which improve stability and promote effective feature propagation across layers. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets including OGB, ACM, DBLP, IIP TerroristRel, Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed demonstrate that HGMN consistently outperforms strong baselines in node classification tasks. These results support the claim that explicitly incorporating role-based features within a hypergraph framework offers tangible benefits for node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphToxin: Reconstructing Full Unlearned Graphs from Graph Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10936v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with "the right to be forgotten" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to S&P 2026.

| **[Enhanced Structured Lasso Pruning with Class-wise Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09125v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern applications require lightweight neural network models. Most existing neural network pruning methods focus on removing unimportant filters; however, these may result in the loss of statistical information after pruning due to failing to consider the class-wise information. In this paper, we employ the structured lasso from the perspective of utilizing precise class-wise information for model pruning with the help of Information Bottleneck theory, which guides us to ensure the retention of statistical information before and after pruning. With these techniques, we propose two novel adaptive network pruning schemes in parallel: sparse graph-structured lasso pruning with Information Bottleneck (sGLP-IB) and sparse tree-guided lasso pruning with Information Bottleneck (sTLP-IB). The key component is that we prune the model filters utilizing sGLP-IB and sTLP-IB with more precise structured class-wise relatedness. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods, our approaches achieve the best performance across three datasets and six model structures on extensive experiments. For example, with the VGG16 model based on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we can reduce the parameters by 85%, decrease the FLOPs by 61%, and maintain an accuracy of 94.10% (0.14% better than the original). For large-scale ImageNet, we can reduce the parameters by 55% while keeping the accuracy at 76.12% (only drop 0.03%) using the ResNet architecture. In summary, we succeed in reducing the model size and computational resource usage while maintaining the effectiveness of accuracy.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

Models are trained with 10-fold splits and evaluated with SMILES test-time augmentation. The approach ranks 9th of 2241 teams in the Open Polymer Prediction Challenge at NeurIPS 2025. The submitted ensemble achieves a public MAE of 0.057 and a private MAE of 0.082.</p></details> |  |
| **[Urban Incident Prediction with Graph Neural Networks: Integrating Government Ratings and Crowdsourced Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08740v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in urban spatiotemporal forecasting, such as predicting infrastructure problems. In this setting, government officials wish to know in which neighborhoods incidents like potholes or rodent issues occur. The true state of incidents (e.g., street conditions) for each neighborhood is observed via government inspection ratings. However, these ratings are only conducted for a sparse set of neighborhoods and incident types. We also observe the state of incidents via crowdsourced reports, which are more densely observed but may be biased due to heterogeneous reporting behavior. First, for such settings, we propose a multiview, multioutput GNN-based model that uses both unbiased rating data and biased reporting data to predict the true latent state of incidents. Second, we investigate a case study of New York City urban incidents and collect, standardize, and make publicly available a dataset of 9,615,863 crowdsourced reports and 1,041,415 government inspection ratings over 3 years and across 139 types of incidents. Finally, we show on both real and semi-synthetic data that our model can better predict the latent state compared to models that use only reporting data or models that use only rating data, especially when rating data is sparse and reports are predictive of ratings. We also quantify demographic biases in crowdsourced reporting, e.g., higher-income neighborhoods report problems at higher rates. Our analysis showcases a widely applicable approach for latent state prediction using heterogeneous, sparse, and biased data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[CNN-Enabled Scheduling for Probabilistic Real-Time Guarantees in Industrial URLLC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14987v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks. We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a CNN-based dynamic priority prediction mechanism for improved interference coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network and graph coloring to adaptively assign link priorities based on real-time traffic, transmission opportunities, and network conditions. Assuming that first training phase is performed offline, our approach introduced minimal overhead, while enabling more efficient resource allocation, boosting network capacity, SINR, and schedulability. Simulation results show SINR gains of up to 113\%, 94\%, and 49\% over LDP across three network configurations, highlighting its effectiveness for complex URLLC scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart. Our findings suggest that upgrading to more advanced language models when thoughtfully integrated, can lead to real improvements in how well we can analyze sentiments in text. The implementation of our approach is publicly available at: https://github.com/VishalRepos/DESS.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 figures.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in this setting. However, traditional statically-provisioned GNN inference architectures fall short in meeting two crucial demands of intrusion detection: (1) maintaining consistently low detection latency, and (2) handling highly irregular and bursty workloads. To holistically address these challenges, we present GraphFaaS, a serverless architecture tailored for GNN-based intrusion detection. GraphFaaS leverages the elasticity and agility of serverless computing to dynamically scale the GNN inference pipeline. We parallelize and adapt GNN workflows to a serverless environment, ensuring that the system can respond in real time to fluctuating workloads. By decoupling compute resources from static provisioning, GraphFaaS delivers stable inference latency, which is critical for dependable intrusion detection and timely incident response in cybersecurity operations. Preliminary evaluation shows GraphFaaS reduces average detection latency by 85% and coefficient of variation (CV) by 64% compared to the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ML For Systems workshop at Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[On Stealing Graph Neural Network Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07170v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current graph neural network (GNN) model-stealing methods rely heavily on queries to the victim model, assuming no hard query limits. However, in reality, the number of allowed queries can be severely limited. In this paper, we demonstrate how an adversary can extract a GNN with very limited interactions with the model. Our approach first enables the adversary to obtain the model backbone without making direct queries to the victim model and then to strategically utilize a fixed query limit to extract the most informative data. The experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack, even under a very restricted query limit and under defense against model extraction in place. Our findings underscore the need for robust defenses against GNN model extraction threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Our method employs a GPU-resident, bin-partitioned approach with full gradient-flow support and adaptive parameter tuning, significantly enhancing both computational and memory efficiency. Benchmarking demonstrates that FastGraph achieves a 20-40x speedup over state-of-the-art libraries such as FAISS, ANNOY, and SCANN in dimensions less than 10 with virtually no memory overhead. These improvements directly translate into substantial performance gains for GNN-based workflows, particularly benefiting computationally intensive applications in low dimensions such as particle clustering in high-energy physics, visual object tracking, and graph clustering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient quantification on large-scale networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15267v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network quantification (NQ) is the problem of estimating the proportions of nodes belonging to each class in subsets of unlabelled graph nodes. When prior probability shift is at play, this task cannot be effectively addressed by first classifying the nodes and then counting the class predictions. In addition, unlike non-relational quantification, NQ demands enhanced flexibility in order to capture a broad range of connectivity patterns, resilience to the challenge of heterophily, and scalability to large networks. In order to meet these stringent requirements, we introduce XNQ, a novel method that synergizes the flexibility and efficiency of the unsupervised node embeddings computed by randomized recursive Graph Neural Networks, with an Expectation-Maximization algorithm that provides a robust quantification-aware adjustment to the output probabilities of a calibrated node classifier. In an extensive evaluation, in which we also validate the design choices underpinning XNQ through comprehensive ablation experiments, we find that XNQ consistently and significantly improves on the best network quantification methods to date, thereby setting the new state of the art for this challenging task. XNQ also provides a training speed-up of up to 10x-100x over other methods based on graph learning.</p></details> | Published version |

However, traditional FIM assessment imposes a significant burden on both patients and healthcare professionals. To address this challenge, we propose an automated FIM score estimation method that utilizes simple exercises different from the designated FIM assessment actions. Our approach employs a deep neural network architecture integrating a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and an attention mechanism to estimate FIM motor item scores. The model effectively captures long-term temporal dependencies and identifies key body-joint contributions through learned attention weights. We evaluated our method in a study of 277 rehabilitation patients, focusing on FIM transfer and locomotion items. Our approach successfully distinguishes between completely independent patients and those requiring assistance, achieving balanced accuracies of 70.09-78.79 % across different FIM items. Additionally, our analysis reveals specific movement patterns that serve as reliable predictors for particular FIM evaluation items.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 3tables, Accepted for the 2026 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII 2026), January 11-14, 2026, Cancun, Mexico</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Logical Expressiveness in Graph Neural Networks via Path-Neighbor Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07994v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively model structural information of graphs, making them widely used in knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the high costs of building sensor networks limit their scale and coverage, making fine-grained deployment challenging. Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging (ISK) addresses this issue by introducing virtual sensors. Based on graph neural networks (GNNs) extracting the relationships between physical and virtual sensors, ISK can infer the measurements of virtual sensors from physical sensors. However, current ISK methods rely on conventional message-passing mechanisms and network architectures, without effectively extracting spatio-temporal features of physical sensors and focusing on representing virtual sensors. Additionally, existing graph construction methods face issues of sparse and noisy connections, destroying ISK performance. To address these issues, we propose DarkFarseer, a novel ISK framework with three key components. First, we propose the Neighbor Hidden Style Enhancement module with a style transfer strategy to enhance the representation of virtual nodes in a temporal-then-spatial manner to better extract the spatial relationships between physical and virtual nodes. Second, we propose Virtual-Component Contrastive Learning, which aims to enrich the node representation by establishing the association between the patterns of virtual nodes and the regional patterns within graph components. Lastly, we design a Similarity-Based Graph Denoising Strategy, which reduces the connectivity strength of noisy connections around virtual nodes and their neighbors based on their temporal information and regional spatial patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DarkFarseer significantly outperforms existing ISK methods.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI'26 |

Existing methods, such as those based on Fourier or graph techniques, make strong as- sumptions about the structure of the kernel integral opera- tor, assumptions which may limit expressivity. We present SVD-NO, a neural operator that explicitly parameterizes the kernel by its singular-value decomposition (SVD) and then carries out the integral directly in the low-rank basis. Two lightweight networks learn the left and right singular func- tions, a diagonal parameter matrix learns the singular values, and a Gram-matrix regularizer enforces orthonormality. As SVD-NO approximates the full kernel, it obtains a high de- gree of expressivity. Furthermore, due to its low-rank struc- ture the computational complexity of applying the operator remains reasonable, leading to a practical system. In exten- sive evaluations on five diverse benchmark equations, SVD- NO achieves a new state of the art. In particular, SVD-NO provides greater performance gains on PDEs whose solutions are highly spatially variable.

These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither category addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that adaptively builds similarity-based edges to strengthen connectivity of minority-class nodes, and Relation Diffusion that captures higher-order dependencies while amplifying signals from minority classes. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 3.67\%.</p></details> |  |

However, predicting the diffusion trajectory and market impact of such content remains challenging due to data heterogeneity, non linear propagation mechanisms, and evolving consumer interactions. This study proposes an AI driven Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates multi source data including social media streams, marketing expenditure records, consumer engagement logs, and sentiment dynamics using a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Temporal Transformer framework. The model jointly learns the content diffusion structure and temporal influence evolution through a dual channel architecture, while causal inference modules disentangle the effects of marketing stimuli on return on investment (ROI) and market visibility. Experiments on large scale real-world datasets collected from multiple online platforms such as Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube advertising show that our system outperforms existing baselines in all six metrics. The proposed DSS enhances marketing decisions by providing interpretable real-time insights into AIGC driven content dissemination and market growth patterns.</p></details> |  |

While powerful, ViGs often face substantial computational challenges stemming from their graph construction phase, which can hinder their efficiency. To address this issue we propose AdaptViG, an efficient and powerful hybrid Vision GNN that introduces a novel graph construction mechanism called Adaptive Graph Convolution. This mechanism builds upon a highly efficient static axial scaffold and a dynamic, content-aware gating strategy called Exponential Decay Gating. This gating mechanism selectively weighs long-range connections based on feature similarity. Furthermore, AdaptViG employs a hybrid strategy, utilizing our efficient gating mechanism in the early stages and a full Global Attention block in the final stage for maximum feature aggregation. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among Vision GNNs. For instance, our AdaptViG-M achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy, outperforming ViG-B by 0.3% while using 80% fewer parameters and 84% fewer GMACs. On downstream tasks, AdaptViG-M obtains 45.8 mIoU, 44.8 APbox, and 41.1 APmask, surpassing the much larger EfficientFormer-L7 by 0.7 mIoU, 2.2 APbox, and 2.1 APmask, respectively, with 78% fewer parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2026 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV 2026)</p></details> |

As models increase in size and complexity, DNN workloads such as training and inference tasks impose unprecedented demands on distributed computing resources, making accurate runtime prediction essential for optimizing development and resource allocation. Traditional methods rely on additive computational unit models, limiting their accuracy and generalizability. In contrast, graph-enhanced modeling improves performance but significantly increases data collection costs. Therefore, there is a critical need for a method that strikes a balance between accuracy, generalizability, and data collection costs. To address these challenges, we propose ScaleDL, a novel runtime prediction framework that combines nonlinear layer-wise modeling with graph neural network (GNN)-based cross-layer interaction mechanism, enabling accurate DNN runtime prediction and hierarchical generalizability across different network architectures. Additionally, we employ the D-optimal method to reduce data collection costs. Experiments on the workloads of five popular DNN models demonstrate that ScaleDL enhances runtime prediction accuracy and generalizability, achieving 6 times lower MRE and 5 times lower RMSE compared to baseline models.</p></details> |  |

Differentiable causal graphical models have been proposed to infer a gene regulatory network (GRN) from large scale interventional datasets, capturing the causal gene regulatory relationships from genetic perturbations. However, existing models are limited in their expressivity and scalability while failing to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.</p></details> |  |

These approaches iteratively measure low-order noisy marginals and fit graphical models to produce synthetic data, enabling systematic optimisation of data quality under privacy constraints. Graphical models, however, are inefficient for high-dimensional data because they require substantial memory and must be retrained from scratch whenever the graph structure changes, leading to significant computational overhead. Recent methods, like GEM, overcome these limitations by using generator neural networks for improved scalability. However, empirical comparisons have mostly focused on small datasets, limiting real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce GEM+, which integrates AIM's adaptive measurement framework with GEM's scalable generator network. Our experiments show that GEM+ outperforms AIM in both utility and scalability, delivering state-of-the-art results while efficiently handling datasets with over a hundred columns, where AIM fails due to memory and computational overheads.</p></details> |  |

However, 3D medical image classification remains a challenging task due to the complex spatial relationships and long-range dependencies inherent in volumetric data. Training models from scratch suffers from low data regimes, and the absence of 3D large-scale multimodal datasets has limited the development of 3D medical imaging foundation models. Recent studies, however, have highlighted the potential of 2D vision foundation models, originally trained on natural images, as powerful feature extractors for medical image analysis. Despite these advances, existing approaches that apply 2D models to 3D volumes via slice-based decomposition remain suboptimal. Conventional volume slicing strategies, which rely on canonical planes such as axial, sagittal, or coronal, may inadequately capture the spatial extent of target structures when these are misaligned with standardized viewing planes. Furthermore, existing slice-wise aggregation strategies rarely account for preserving the volumetric structure, resulting in a loss of spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. We publicly share our accessible code base at http://github.com/compai-lab/2025-MedIA-kiechle and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at https://pypi.org/project/OmniSlicer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Medical Image Analysis (MedIA)</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose GNNMoE, a novel entropy-driven mixture of message-passing experts framework that enables node-level adaptive representation learning. GNNMoE decomposes message passing into propagation and transformation operations and integrates them through multiple expert networks guided by a hybrid routing mechanism. And a routing entropy regularization dynamically adjusts soft weighting and soft top-$k$ routing, allowing GNNMoE to flexibly adapt to diverse neighborhood contexts. Extensive experiments on twelve benchmark datasets demonstrate that GNNMoE consistently outperforms SOTA node classification methods, while maintaining scalability and interpretability. This work provides a unified and principled approach for achieving fine-grained, personalized node representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynamicRTL: RTL Representation Learning for Dynamic Circuit Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09593v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing body of work on using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn representations of circuits, focusing primarily on their static characteristics. However, these models fail to capture circuit runtime behavior, which is crucial for tasks like circuit verification and optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce DR-GNN (DynamicRTL-GNN), a novel approach that learns RTL circuit representations by incorporating both static structures and multi-cycle execution behaviors. DR-GNN leverages an operator-level Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to represent Register Transfer Level (RTL) circuits, enabling the model to capture dynamic dependencies and runtime execution. To train and evaluate DR-GNN, we build the first comprehensive dynamic circuit dataset, comprising over 6,300 Verilog designs and 63,000 simulation traces. Our results demonstrate that DR-GNN outperforms existing models in branch hit prediction and toggle rate prediction. Furthermore, its learned representations transfer effectively to related dynamic circuit tasks, achieving strong performance in power estimation and assertion prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI'2026</p></details> |
| **[Conditional Distribution Learning for Graph Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15206v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the diversity and quantity of data provided by various graph-structured data augmentations while preserving intrinsic semantic information is challenging. Additionally, successive layers in graph neural network (GNN) tend to produce more similar node embeddings, while graph contrastive learning aims to increase the dissimilarity between negative pairs of node embeddings. This inevitably results in a conflict between the message-passing mechanism (MPM) of GNNs and the contrastive learning (CL) of negative pairs via intraviews. In this paper, we propose a conditional distribution learning (CDL) method that learns graph representations from graph-structured data for semisupervised graph classification. Specifically, we present an end-to-end graph representation learning model to align the conditional distributions of weakly and strongly augmented features over the original features. This alignment enables the CDL model to effectively preserve intrinsic semantic information when both weak and strong augmentations are applied to graph-structured data. To avoid the conflict between the MPM and the CL of negative pairs, positive pairs of node representations are retained for measuring the similarity between the original features and the corresponding weakly augmented features. Extensive experiments with several benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDL method.</p></details> | 8 pages |

GSP stands as a key tool in unraveling the interplay between the brain's function and structure, enabling the analysis of graphs defined by the connections between regions of interest -- referred to as connectomes in this context. Our work represents a further step in this direction by exploring supervised contrastive learning methods within the realm of graph representation learning. The main objective of this approach is to generate subject-level (i.e., graph-level) vector representations that bring together subjects sharing the same label while separating those with different labels. These connectome embeddings are derived from a graph neural network Encoder-Decoder architecture, which jointly considers structural and functional connectivity. By leveraging data augmentation techniques, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in a gender classification task using Human Connectome Project data. More broadly, our connectome-centric methodological advances support the promising prospect of using GSP to discover more about brain function, with potential impact to understanding heterogeneity in the neurodegeneration for precision medicine and diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Distributed Training Architecture For Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09261v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in tackling combinatorial optimization problems. However, existing methods still suffer from limited accuracy when addressing that on complex graphs and exhibit poor scalability, since full training requires loading the whole adjacent matrix and all embeddings at a time, the it may results in out of memory of a single machine. This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real large-scale social network datasets (e.g., Facebook, Youtube) and synthetically generated high-complexity graphs, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both solution quality and computational efficiency. Moreover, the experiments on large graph instances also validate the scalability of the model.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoCo-MILP: Inter-Variable Contrastive and Intra-Constraint Competitive MILP Solution Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09209v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet solving large-scale instances remains a significant computational challenge. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

In general, HRTFs are subject-dependent and position-dependent, and their measurement is time-consuming and tedious. To address this challenge, we propose the Graph Neural Field with Spatial-Correlation Augmentation (GraphNF-SCA) for HRTF personalization, which can be used to generate individual HRTFs for unseen subjects. The GraphNF-SCA consists of three key components: an HRTF personalization (HRTF-P) module, an HRTF upsampling (HRTF-U) module, and a fine-tuning stage. In the HRTF-P module, we predict HRTFs of the target subject via the Graph Neural Network (GNN) with an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder extracts universal features and the decoder incorporates the target-relevant features and produces individualized HRTFs. The HRTF-U module employs another GNN to model spatial correlations across HRTFs. This module is fine-tuned using the output of the HRTF-P module, thereby enhancing the spatial consistency of the predicted HRTFs. Unlike existing methods that estimate individual HRTFs position-by-position without spatial correlation modeling, the GraphNF-SCA effectively leverages inherent spatial correlations across HRTFs to enhance the performance of HRTF personalization. Experimental results demonstrate that the GraphNF-SCA achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, this work introduces an open-source platform that exploits Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to accelerate SEU fault simulation. The platform includes three STGNN architectures incorporating advanced components such as Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and attention mechanisms, thereby improving spatio-temporal feature extraction. In addition, SEU fault simulation datasets are constructed from six open-source circuits with varying levels of complexity, providing a comprehensive benchmark for performance evaluation. The predictive capability of the STGNN models is analyzed and compared on these datasets. Moreover, to further investigate the efficiency of the approach, we evaluate the predictive capability of STGNNs across multiple test cases and discuss their generalization capability.

However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>CAMLI...</summary><p>CAMLIS 2025.

Increasing the GNN depth can expand the scope (i.e., receptive field), potentially finding homophily from the higher-order neighborhoods. However, GNNs suffer from performance degradation as depth increases. Despite having better expressivity, state-of-the-art deeper GNNs achieve only marginal improvements compared to their shallow variants. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we systematically demonstrate a shift in GNN generalization preferences across nodes with different homophily levels as depth increases. This creates a disparity in generalization patterns between GNN models with varying depth. Based on these findings, we propose to improve deeper GNN generalization while maintaining high expressivity by Mixture of scope experts at test (Moscat). Experimental results show that Moscat works flexibly with various GNNs across a wide range of datasets while significantly improving accuracy.

| **[GeoGNN: Quantifying and Mitigating Semantic Drift in Text-Attributed Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09042v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) on text--attributed graphs (TAGs) typically encode node texts using pretrained language models (PLMs) and propagate these embeddings through linear neighborhood aggregation. However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning.</p></details> | 10 pages |

We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks. Our work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI2026.

These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction.

However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc descriptor-based residual uncertainty modeling (P-DRUM). P-DRUM models the discrepancy between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of P-DRUM and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their effectiveness and limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences (ML4PS)</p></details> |

As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIFT-Graph: Benchmarking Multimodal Defense Against Image Adversarial Attacks With Robust Feature Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08810v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks expose a fundamental vulnerability in modern deep vision models by exploiting their dependence on dense, pixel-level representations that are highly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations. Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the visual model robustness against gradient-based white box adversarial attacks, while incurring only a marginal drop in clean accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV2025 Workshop, short paper</p></details> |

While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yanghuoshan/PEGNet.</p></details> |  |

While logic inference on top of subsymbolic modules has been shown to effectively guarantee these properties, this often comes at the cost of reduced scalability, which can severely limit the usability of NeSy models. This paper introduces DeepProofLog (DPrL), a novel NeSy system based on stochastic logic programs, which addresses the scalability limitations of previous methods. DPrL parameterizes all derivation steps with neural networks, allowing efficient neural guidance over the proving system. Additionally, we establish a formal mapping between the resolution process of our deep stochastic logic programs and Markov Decision Processes, enabling the application of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques for efficient inference and learning. This theoretical connection improves scalability for complex proof spaces and large knowledge bases. Our experiments on standard NeSy benchmarks and knowledge graph reasoning tasks demonstrate that DPrL outperforms existing state-of-the-art NeSy systems, advancing scalability to larger and more complex settings than previously possible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We propose Adaptive Regularized Multi-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (ARAC), which integrates an attention-based graph neural network (GNN) for modeling agent dependencies with an adaptive divergence regularization mechanism. The GNN enables expressive representation of spatial relations and state features in graph environments. Divergence regularization can serve as policy guidance to alleviate the sparse reward problem, but it may lead to suboptimal convergence when the reference policy itself is imperfect. The adaptive divergence regularization mechanism enables the framework to exploit reference policies for efficient exploration in the early stages, while gradually reducing reliance on them as training progresses to avoid inheriting their limitations. Experiments in pursuit and confrontation scenarios demonstrate that ARAC achieves faster convergence, higher final success rates, and stronger scalability across varying numbers of agents compared with MARL baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in complex graph-structured environments.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, these methods often fail to capture the complex argumentative reasoning and negotiation dynamics inherent in reviewer-author interactions. To address these limitations, we propose ReViewGraph (Reviewer-Author Debates Graph Reasoner), a novel framework that performs heterogeneous graph reasoning over LLM-simulated multi-round reviewer-author debates. In our approach, reviewer-author exchanges are simulated through LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Diverse opinion relations (e.g., acceptance, rejection, clarification, and compromise) are then explicitly extracted and encoded as typed edges within a heterogeneous interaction graph. By applying graph neural networks to reason over these structured debate graphs, ReViewGraph captures fine-grained argumentative dynamics and enables more informed review decisions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that ReViewGraph outperforms strong baselines with an average relative improvement of 15.73%, underscoring the value of modeling detailed reviewer-author debate structures.</p></details> |  |

In BDD-based reversible-circuit synthesis, which is critical for quantum computing, the chosen variable ordering governs the number of BDD nodes and thus the key metrics of resource consumption, such as Quantum Cost. Because finding an optimal variable ordering for BDDs is an NP-complete problem, existing heuristics often degrade as circuit complexity grows. We introduce BDD2Seq, a graph-to-sequence framework that couples a Graph Neural Network encoder with a Pointer-Network decoder and Diverse Beam Search to predict high-quality orderings. By treating the circuit netlist as a graph, BDD2Seq learns structural dependencies that conventional heuristics overlooked, yielding smaller BDDs and faster synthesis. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks show that BDD2Seq achieves around 1.4 times lower Quantum Cost and 3.7 times faster synthesis than modern heuristic algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle the variable-ordering problem in BDD-based reversible-circuit synthesis with a graph-based generative model and diversity-promoting decoding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Kernel Graph Community Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08287v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the absence of task-specific labels. However, its scalability on large-scale graphs is hindered by the intensive message passing mechanism of GNN and the quadratic computational complexity of contrastive loss over positive and negative node pairs. To address these issues, we propose an efficient GCL framework that transforms the input graph into a compact network of interconnected node sets while preserving structural information across communities. We firstly introduce a kernelized graph community contrastive loss with linear complexity, enabling effective information transfer among node sets to capture hierarchical structural information of the graph. We then incorporate a knowledge distillation technique into the decoupled GNN architecture to accelerate inference while maintaining strong generalization performance. Extensive experiments on sixteen real-world datasets of varying scales demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines in both effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stuart-Landau Oscillatory Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08094v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oscillatory Graph Neural Networks (OGNNs) are an emerging class of physics-inspired architectures designed to mitigate oversmoothing and vanishing gradient problems in deep GNNs. In this work, we introduce the Complex-Valued Stuart-Landau Graph Neural Network (SLGNN), a novel architecture grounded in Stuart-Landau oscillator dynamics. Stuart-Landau oscillators are canonical models of limit-cycle behavior near Hopf bifurcations, which are fundamental to synchronization theory and are widely used in e.g. neuroscience for mesoscopic brain modeling. Unlike harmonic oscillators and phase-only Kuramoto models, Stuart-Landau oscillators retain both amplitude and phase dynamics, enabling rich phenomena such as amplitude regulation and multistable synchronization. The proposed SLGNN generalizes existing phase-centric Kuramoto-based OGNNs by allowing node feature amplitudes to evolve dynamically according to Stuart-Landau dynamics, with explicit tunable hyperparameters (such as the Hopf-parameter and the coupling strength) providing additional control over the interplay between feature amplitudes and network structure. We conduct extensive experiments across node classification, graph classification, and graph regression tasks, demonstrating that SLGNN outperforms existing OGNNs and establishes a novel, expressive, and theoretically grounded framework for deep oscillatory architectures on graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining LLM Semantic Reasoning with GNN Structural Modeling for Multi-view Multi-Label Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08008v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view multi-label feature selection aims to identify informative features from heterogeneous views, where each sample is associated with multiple interdependent labels. This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches rely on simplistic state representations and fuse heterogeneous information via naive concatenation, limiting their ability to capture rich structural and semantic context. To address these limitations, we propose GAMA, a neural neighborhood search method with Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention model in VRP. GAMA encodes the problem instance and its evolving solution as distinct modalities using graph neural networks, and models their intra- and inter-modal interactions through stacked self- and cross-attention layers. A gated fusion mechanism further integrates the multi-modal representations into a structured state, enabling the policy to make informed and generalizable operator selection decisions. Extensive experiments conducted across various synthetic and benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm GAMA significantly outperforms the recent neural baselines. Further ablation studies confirm that both the multi-modal attention mechanism and the gated fusion design play a key role in achieving the observed performance gains.</p></details> |  |

However, current graph neural networks (GNNs) produce suboptimal results for subgraph-level tasks due to their inability to capture complex interactions within and between subgraphs. To provide a more expressive and efficient alternative, we propose WLKS, a Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernel generalized for subgraphs by applying the WL algorithm on induced $k$-hop neighborhoods. We combine kernels across different $k$-hop levels to capture richer structural information that is not fully encoded in existing models. Our approach can balance expressiveness and efficiency by eliminating the need for neighborhood sampling. In experiments on eight real-world and synthetic benchmarks, WLKS significantly outperforms leading approaches on five datasets while reducing training time, ranging from 0.01x to 0.25x compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera Ready (15 pages), with minor typos fixed</p></details> |

While existing solutions, such as residual connections and skip layers, alleviate this issue to some extent, they fail to explicitly model how node representations evolve in a node-specific and progressive manner across layers. Moreover, these methods do not take global information into account, which is also crucial for mitigating the over-smoothing problem. To address the aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a Dual Mamba-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (DMbaGCN), which is a novel framework that integrates Mamba into GNNs to address over-smoothing from both local and global perspectives. DMbaGCN consists of two modules: the Local State-Evolution Mamba (LSEMba) for local neighborhood aggregation and utilizing Mamba's selective state space modeling to capture node-specific representation dynamics across layers, and the Global Context-Aware Mamba (GCAMba) that leverages Mamba's global attention capabilities to incorporate global context for each node. By combining these components, DMbaGCN enhances node discriminability in deep GNNs, thereby mitigating over-smoothing. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Traditional SPICE simulations are time-consuming, while existing machine learning methods often require topology-specific retraining or manual substructure segmentation for fine-tuning, hindering scalability and adaptability. In this work, we propose ZeroSim, a transformer-based performance modeling framework designed to achieve robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies under novel parameter configurations and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without any fine-tuning. We apply three key enabling strategies: (1) a diverse training corpus of 3.6 million instances covering over 60 amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings leveraging global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention to robustly generalize to novel circuits, and (3) a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations. Our experimental results demonstrate that ZeroSim significantly outperforms baseline models such as multilayer perceptrons, graph neural networks and transformers, delivering accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies. Additionally, when integrated into a reinforcement learning-based parameter optimization pipeline, ZeroSim achieves a remarkable speedup (13x) compared to conventional SPICE simulations, underscoring its practical value for a wide range of analog circuit design automation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCAD 2025</p></details> |

However, their widespread adoption has raised serious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on edge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology privacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing their vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a suite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure of a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our findings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they either fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To address this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a novel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining model accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a synthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the GNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with minimal impact on model accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/JeffffffFu/PGR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accte...</summary><p>Acctepted by ACM CCS'25</p></details> |

In particular, these simulators enable end-to-end training of machine learning (ML) models embedded within CFD solvers. This paradigm enables novel algorithms which combine the generalization power and low cost of physics-based simulations with the flexibility and automation of deep learning methods. In this study, we introduce a framework for embedding deep learning models within a finite element solver for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, specifically applying this approach to learn a subgrid-scale (SGS) closure with a graph neural network (GNN). We first demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on flow over a two-dimensional backward-facing step, using it as a proof of concept to show that solver-consistent training produces stable and physically meaningful closures. Then, we extend this to a turbulent flow over a three-dimensional backward-facing step. In this setting, the GNN-based closure not only attains low prediction errors, but also recovers key turbulence statistics and preserves multiscale turbulent structures. We further demonstrate that the closure can be identified in data-limited learning scenarios as well. Overall, the proposed end-to-end learning paradigm offers a viable pathway toward physically consistent and generalizable data-driven SGS modeling on complex and unstructured domains.</p></details> |  |

However, this can cause overreliance on surface-level labels and impede cross-type knowledge transfer. We explore integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into HGNNs--a direction underexplored despite MoE's success in homogeneous settings. Crucially, we question the need for type-specific experts. We propose Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER), an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) that stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to encourage type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP for link prediction, HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB shows HER experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming routing is driven by latent semantics. Our work demonstrates that regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations--a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures; 2 tables; work in progress, feedback welcome</p></details> |

However, their susceptibility to poisoning attacks poses a critical security risk. We introduce LoReTTA (Low Resource Two-phase Temporal Attack), a novel adversarial framework on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs, which degrades TGNN performance by an average of 29.47% across 4 widely benchmark datasets and 4 State-of-the-Art (SotA) models. LoReTTA operates through a two-stage approach: (1) sparsify the graph by removing high-impact edges using any of the 16 tested temporal importance metrics, (2) strategically replace removed edges with adversarial negatives via LoReTTA's novel degree-preserving negative sampling algorithm. Our plug-and-play design eliminates the need for expensive surrogate models while adhering to realistic unnoticeability constraints. LoReTTA degrades performance by upto 42.0% on MOOC, 31.5% on Wikipedia, 28.8% on UCI, and 15.6% on Enron.

While single-table tabular data generation has seen considerable progress, current methods for multi-table data often lack the flexibility and expressiveness needed to capture complex relational structures. In particular, they struggle with long-range dependencies and complex foreign-key relationships, such as tables with multiple parent tables or multiple types of links between the same pair of tables. We propose a generative model for relational data that generates the content of a relational dataset given the graph formed by the foreign-key relationships. We do this by learning a deep generative model of the content of the whole relational database by flow matching, where the neural network trained to denoise records leverages a graph neural network to obtain information from connected records. Our method is flexible, as it can support relational datasets with complex structures, and expressive, as the generation of each record can be influenced by any other record within the same connected component. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of synthetic data fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages of main content, accepted to AAAI26 conference</p></details> |

However, existing RSSI-based positioning methods often suffer from reduced accuracy due to environmental complexity and challenges in processing multi-source information. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-graph heterogeneous GNN framework (MG-HGNN) to enhance spatial awareness and improve positioning performance. In this framework, two graph construction branches perform node and edge embedding, respectively, to generate informative graphs. Subsequently, a heterogeneous graph neural network is employed for graph representation learning, enabling accurate positioning. The MG-HGNN framework introduces the following key innovations: 1) multi-type task-directed graph construction that combines label estimation and feature encoding for richer graph information; 2) a heterogeneous GNN structure that enhances the performance of conventional GNN models. Evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc public datasets demonstrate that MG-HGNN not only achieves superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods, but also provides a novel perspective for enhancing GNN-based localization methods. Ablation studies further confirm the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

The approach leverages gradient-based saliency maps derived from trained neural networks to guide the discovery process. Multiclass time series classification problems are transformed into binary classification problems through label subsumption, and classifiers are trained for each of these to yield saliency maps. The input signals, grouped by predicted class, are clustered under three distinct configurations. The centroids of the final set of clusters are provided as input to an LLM for symbolic approximation and fuzzy knowledge graph matching to discover the underlying subclasses of the original multiclass problem. Experimental results on well-established time series classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our saliency map-driven method for knowledge discovery, outperforming signal-only baselines in both clustering and subclass identification.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional frameworks that focus on regressing scalar quantities and derive tensorial properties from their derivatives, our approach maintains $SO(3)$-equivariance through the use of local coordinate frames. Our GNN effectively captures geometric information by integrating scalar, vector, and tensor channels within a local message-passing framework. To assess the accuracy of our model, we apply it to predict the polarizabilities of molecules in the QM7-X dataset and show that tensorial message passing outperforms scalar message passing models. This work marks an advancement towards developing structured, geometry-aware neural models for molecular property prediction.</p></details> |  |

Attribution graphs reveal these feature pathways, but interpreting them requires extensive manual analysis -- a single prompt can take approximately 2 hours for an experienced circuit tracer. We present probe prompting, an automated pipeline that transforms attribution graphs into compact, interpretable subgraphs built from concept-aligned supernodes. Starting from a seed prompt and target logit, we select high-influence features, generate concept-targeted yet context-varying probes, and group features by cross-prompt activation signatures into Semantic, Relationship, and Say-X categories using transparent decision rules. Across five prompts including classic "capitals" circuits, probe-prompted subgraphs preserve high explanatory coverage while compressing complexity (Completeness 0.83, mean across circuits; Replacement 0.54). Compared to geometric clustering baselines, concept-aligned groups exhibit higher behavioral coherence: 2.3x higher peak-token consistency (0.425 vs 0.183) and 5.8x higher activation-pattern similarity (0.762 vs 0.130), despite lower geometric compactness. Entity-swap tests reveal a layerwise hierarchy: early-layer features transfer robustly (64% transfer rate, mean layer 6.3), while late-layer Say-X features specialize for output promotion (mean layer 16.4), supporting a backbone-and-specialization view of transformer computation.

However, many leading Graph Neural Network (GNN) models often neglect the valuable semantic information aggregated at the class level. To address this limitation, this paper introduces CGLE (Class-label Graph Link Estimator), a novel framework designed to augment GNN-based link prediction models. CGLE operates by constructing a class-conditioned link probability matrix, where each entry represents the probability of a link forming between two node classes. This matrix is derived from either available ground-truth labels or from pseudo-labels obtained through clustering. The resulting class-based prior is then concatenated with the structural link embedding from a backbone GNN, and the combined representation is processed by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the final prediction. Crucially, CGLE's logic is encapsulated in an efficient preprocessing stage, leaving the computational complexity of the underlying GNN model unaffected. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a broad suite of benchmark datasets, covering both homophilous and sparse heterophilous graphs. The results show that CGLE yields substantial performance gains over strong baselines such as NCN and NCNC, with improvements in HR@100 of over 10 percentage points on homophilous datasets like Pubmed and DBLP.

| **[S-DAG: A Subject-Based Directed Acyclic Graph for Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06727v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in complex reasoning problems. Their effectiveness highly depends on the specific nature of the task, especially the required domain knowledge. Existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts, typically operate at the task level; they are too coarse to effectively solve the heterogeneous problems involving multiple subjects. This work proposes a novel framework that performs fine-grained analysis at subject level equipped with a designated multi-agent collaboration strategy for addressing heterogeneous problem reasoning. Specifically, given an input query, we first employ a Graph Neural Network to identify the relevant subjects and infer their interdependencies to generate an \textit{Subject-based Directed Acyclic Graph} (S-DAG), where nodes represent subjects and edges encode information flow. Then we profile the LLM models by assigning each model a subject-specific expertise score, and select the top-performing one for matching corresponding subject of the S-DAG. Such subject-model matching enables graph-structured multi-agent collaboration where information flows from the starting model to the ending model over S-DAG. We curate and release multi-subject subsets of standard benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, MedMCQA) to better reflect complex, real-world reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing task-level model selection and multi-agent collaboration baselines in accuracy and efficiency. These results highlight the effectiveness of subject-aware reasoning and structured collaboration in addressing complex and multi-subject problems.</p></details> |  |

Conventional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Adapters and LoRA, typically break symmetry, making them incompatible with those equivariant architectures. ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis. We demonstrate that MMEA preserves strict equivariance and, across multiple benchmarks, consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels while training fewer parameters than competing approaches. These results suggest that, in many practical scenarios, modulating channel magnitudes is sufficient to adapt equivariant models to new chemical environments without breaking symmetry, pointing toward a new paradigm for equivariant PEFT design.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining high-resolution CSI remains challenging in practical wireless communication systems. To address this issue, we propose to utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and score-based generative models to enable robust HBF under imperfect CSI conditions. Firstly, we develop the Hybrid Message Graph Attention Network (HMGAT) which updates both node and edge features through node-level and edge-level message passing. Secondly, we design a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based Noise Conditional Score Network (NCSN) to learn the distribution of high-resolution CSI, facilitating CSI generation and data augmentation to further improve HMGAT's performance. Finally, we present a Denoising Score Network (DSN) framework and its instantiation, termed DeBERT, which can denoise imperfect CSI under arbitrary channel error levels, thereby facilitating robust HBF. Experiments on DeepMIMO urban datasets demonstrate the proposed models' superior generalization, scalability, and robustness across various HBF tasks with perfect and imperfect CSI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Flow Matching: Enhancing Image Generation with Neighbor-Aware Flow Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24434v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching casts sample generation as learning a continuous-time velocity field that transports noise to data. Existing flow matching networks typically predict each point's velocity independently, considering only its location and time along its flow trajectory, and ignoring neighboring points. However, this pointwise approach may overlook correlations between points along the generation trajectory that could enhance velocity predictions, thereby improving downstream generation quality. To address this, we propose Graph Flow Matching (GFM), a lightweight enhancement that decomposes the learned velocity into a reaction term -- any standard flow matching network -- and a diffusion term that aggregates neighbor information via a graph neural module. This reaction-diffusion formulation retains the scalability of deep flow models while enriching velocity predictions with local context, all at minimal additional computational cost. Operating in the latent space of a pretrained variational autoencoder, GFM consistently improves Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and recall across five image generation benchmarks (LSUN Church, LSUN Bedroom, FFHQ, AFHQ-Cat, and CelebA-HQ at $256\times256$), demonstrating its effectiveness as a modular enhancement to existing flow matching architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 4...</summary><p>The 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

Recent advanced methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning to characterize the spatial structure of road segments in a self-supervised paradigm. However, spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of road networks raise severe challenges to the neighborhood smoothing mechanism of self-supervised GNNs. To address these issues, we propose a $\textbf{D}$ual-branch $\textbf{S}$patial-$\textbf{T}$emporal self-supervised representation framework for enhanced road representations, termed as DST. On one hand, DST designs a mix-hop transition matrix for graph convolution to incorporate dynamic relations of roads from trajectories. Besides, DST contrasts road representations of the vanilla road network against that of the hypergraph in a spatial self-supervised way. The hypergraph is newly built based on three types of hyperedges to capture long-range relations. On the other hand, DST performs next token prediction as the temporal self-supervised task on the sequences of traffic dynamics based on a causal Transformer, which is further regularized by differentiating traffic modes of weekdays from those of weekends. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods verify the superiority of our proposed framework. Moreover, the comprehensive spatiotemporal modeling facilitates DST to excel in zero-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Spatial Correlations of Earth Observations for weather forecasting by using Graph Structure Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07659v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study aims to improve the accuracy of weather predictions by discovering spatial correlations between Earth observations and atmospheric states. Existing numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems predict future atmospheric states at fixed locations, which are called NWP grid points, by analyzing previous atmospheric states and newly acquired Earth observations. However, the shifting locations of observations and the surrounding meteorological context induce complex, dynamic spatial correlations that are difficult for traditional NWP systems to capture, since they rely on strict statistical and physical formulations. To handle complicated spatial correlations, which change dynamically, we employ a spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) with structure learning. However, structure learning has an inherent limitation that this can cause structural information loss and over-smoothing problem by generating excessive edges. To solve this problem, we regulate edge sampling by adaptively determining node degrees and considering the spatial distances between NWP grid points and observations. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method (CloudNine-v2) using real-world atmospheric state and observation data from East Asia, achieving up to 15\% reductions in RMSE over existing STGNN models. Even in areas with high atmospheric variability, CloudNine-v2 consistently outperformed baselines with and without structure learning.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Beyond Fixed Depth: Adaptive Graph Neural Networks for Node Classification Under Varying Homophily](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06608v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in addressing node classification tasks. However, the effectiveness of traditional GNNs degrades on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different labels or properties. While recent work has introduced mechanisms to improve GNN performance under heterophily, certain key limitations still exist. Most existing models apply a fixed aggregation depth across all nodes, overlooking the fact that nodes may require different propagation depths based on their local homophily levels and neighborhood structures. Moreover, many methods are tailored to either homophilic or heterophilic settings, lacking the flexibility to generalize across both regimes. To address these challenges, we develop a theoretical framework that links local structural and label characteristics to information propagation dynamics at the node level. Our analysis shows that optimal aggregation depth varies across nodes and is critical for preserving class-discriminative information. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel adaptive-depth GNN architecture that dynamically selects node-specific aggregation depths using theoretically grounded metrics. Our method seamlessly adapts to both homophilic and heterophilic patterns within a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the performance of standard GNN backbones across diverse benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing Expert Opinion from Social Media for Stock Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10078v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While stock prediction task traditionally relies on volume-price and fundamental data to predict the return ratio or price movement trend, sentiment factors derived from social media platforms such as StockTwits offer a complementary and useful source of real-time market information. However, we find that most social media posts, along with the public sentiment they reflect, provide limited value for trading predictions due to their noisy nature. To tackle this, we propose a novel dynamic expert tracing algorithm that filters out non-informative posts and identifies both true and inverse experts whose consistent predictions can serve as valuable trading signals. Our approach achieves significant improvements over existing expert identification methods in stock trend prediction. However, when using binary expert predictions to predict the return ratio, similar to all other expert identification methods, our approach faces a common challenge of signal sparsity with expert signals cover only about 4% of all stock-day combinations in our dataset. To address this challenge, we propose a dual graph attention neural network that effectively propagates expert signals across related stocks, enabling accurate prediction of return ratios and significantly increasing signal coverage. Empirical results show that our propagated expert-based signals not only exhibit strong predictive power independently but also work synergistically with traditional financial features. These combined signals significantly outperform representative baseline models in all quant-related metrics including predictive accuracy, return metrics, and correlation metrics, resulting in more robust investment strategies. We hope this work inspires further research into leveraging social media data for enhancing quantitative investment strategies.

| **[Adaptive Initial Residual Connections for GNNs with Theoretical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06598v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message passing is the core operation in graph neural networks, where each node updates its embeddings by aggregating information from its neighbors. However, in deep architectures, this process often leads to diminished expressiveness. A popular solution is to use residual connections, where the input from the current (or initial) layer is added to aggregated neighbor information to preserve embeddings across layers. Following a recent line of research, we investigate an adaptive residual scheme in which different nodes have varying residual strengths. We prove that this approach prevents oversmoothing; particularly, we show that the Dirichlet energy of the embeddings remains bounded away from zero. This is the first theoretical guarantee not only for the adaptive setting, but also for static residual connections (where residual strengths are shared across nodes) with activation functions. Furthermore, extensive experiments show that this adaptive approach outperforms standard and state-of-the-art message passing mechanisms, especially on heterophilic graphs. To improve the time complexity of our approach, we introduce a variant in which residual strengths are not learned but instead set heuristically, a choice that performs as well as the learnable version.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the full version of the paper accepted to the 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2026)</p></details> |

This condensed graph has shown promise in accelerating graph neural networks while preserving performance comparable to those achieved with the original, larger graphs. Additionally, this technique facilitates downstream applications like neural architecture search and deepens our understanding of redundancies in large graphs. Despite the rapid development of GC methods, particularly for node classification, a unified evaluation framework is still lacking to systematically compare different GC methods or clarify key design choices for improving their effectiveness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce \textbf{GC4NC}, a comprehensive framework for evaluating diverse GC methods on node classification across multiple dimensions including performance, efficiency, privacy preservation, denoising ability, NAS effectiveness, and transferability. Our systematic evaluation offers novel insights into how condensed graphs behave and the critical design choices that drive their success. These findings pave the way for future advancements in GC methods, enhancing both performance and expanding their real-world applications.

Mitigating Over-Squashing of GNNs via Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06443v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing graph neural networks typically rely on heuristic choices for hidden dimensions and propagation depths, which often lead to severe information loss during propagation, known as over-squashing. To address this issue, we propose Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation (C3E), a novel framework that formulates the selection of hidden dimensions and depth as a nonlinear programming problem grounded in information theory. Through modeling spectral graph neural networks as communication channels, our approach directly connects channel capacity to hidden dimensions, propagation depth, propagation mechanism, and graph structure. Extensive experiments on nine public datasets demonstrate that hidden dimensions and depths estimated by C3E can mitigate over-squashing and consistently improve representation learning. Experimental results show that over-squashing occurs due to the cumulative compression of information in representation matrices. Furthermore, our findings show that increasing hidden dimensions indeed mitigate information compression, while the role of propagation depth is more nuanced, uncovering a fundamental balance between information compression and representation complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 11 figures.

| **[On the Cross-type Homophily of Heterogeneous Graphs: Understanding and Unleashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14600v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homophily, the tendency of similar nodes to connect, is a fundamental phenomenon in network science and a critical factor in the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs). While existing studies primarily explore homophily in homogeneous graphs, where nodes share the same type, real-world networks are often more accurately modeled as heterogeneous graphs (HGs) with diverse node types and intricate cross-type interactions. This structural diversity complicates the analysis of homophily, as traditional homophily metrics fail to account for distinct label spaces across node types. To address this limitation, we introduce the Cross-Type Homophily Ratio (CHR), a novel metric that quantifies homophily based on the similarity of target information across different node types. Additionally, we propose Cross-Type Homophily-guided Graph Editing (CTHGE), a novel method for improving heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) performance by optimizing cross-type connectivity using Cross-Type Homophily Ratio. Extensive experiments on five HG datasets with nine HGNNs validate the effectiveness of CTHGE, which delivers a maximum relative performance improvement of over 25% for HGNNs on node classification tasks, offering a fresh perspective on cross-type homophily in HGs learning.</p></details> | CIKM 2026 |

Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($ε$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\% reduction in communication overhead. These outcomes demonstrate that FedFair-Traffic is a scalable privacy-aware smart city infrastructure with possible use-cases in metropolitan traffic flow control and federated transportation networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE journal</p></details> |

Although sheaf neural networks partially mitigate this problem, they typically rely on static or heavily parameterized sheaf structures that hinder generalization and scalability. Existing sheaf-based models either predefine restriction maps or introduce excessive complexity, yet fail to provide rigorous stability guarantees. In this paper, we introduce a novel scheme called SGPC (Sheaf GNNs with PAC-Bayes Calibration), a unified architecture that combines cellular-sheaf message passing with several mechanisms, including optimal transport-based lifting, variance-reduced diffusion, and PAC-Bayes spectral regularization for robust semi-supervised node classification. We establish performance bounds theoretically and demonstrate that end-to-end training in linear computational complexity can achieve the resulting bound-aware objective. Experiments on nine homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks show that SGPC outperforms state-of-the-art spectral and sheaf-based GNNs while providing certified confidence intervals on unseen nodes.

However, by observing the MMD posts, we hold that the text modality may be much more informative than the image modality because the text generally describes the whole event/story of the current post but the image often presents partial scenes only. Our preliminary empirical results indicate that the image modality exactly contributes less to MMD. Upon this idea, we propose a new MMD method named RETSIMD. Specifically, we suppose that each text can be divided into several segments, and each text segment describes a partial scene that can be presented by an image. Accordingly, we split the text into a sequence of segments, and feed these segments into a pre-trained text-to-image generator to augment a sequence of images. We further incorporate two auxiliary objectives concerning text-image and image-label mutual information, and further post-train the generator over an auxiliary text-to-image generation benchmark dataset. Additionally, we propose a graph structure by defining three heuristic relationships between images, and use a graph neural network to generate the fused features. Extensive empirical results validate the effectiveness of RETSIMD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026. 13 pages, 6 figures.

Existing methods typically rely on fixed, handcrafted views-usually a local and a global perspective, which limits their ability to capture multi-scale structural patterns. We present an augmentation-free, multi-view GCL framework grounded in fractional-order continuous dynamics. By varying the fractional derivative order $α\in (0,1]$, our encoders produce a continuous spectrum of views: small $α$ yields localized features, while large $α$ induces broader, global aggregation. We treat $α$ as a learnable parameter so the model can adapt diffusion scales to the data and automatically discover informative views. This principled approach generates diverse, complementary representations without manual augmentations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method produces more robust and expressive embeddings and outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines.</p></details> | Submitted to TPAMI |

Accurate and timely inference of supply chain resilience the capability to maintain core functions during disruptions is crucial for proactive risk mitigation and robust network design. However, existing approaches lack effective mechanisms to infer supply chain resilience without explicit system dynamics and struggle to represent the higher-order, multi-entity dependencies inherent in supply chain networks. These limitations motivate the definition of a novel problem and the development of targeted modeling solutions. To address these challenges, we formalize a novel problem: Supply Chain Resilience Inference (SCRI), defined as predicting supply chain resilience using hypergraph topology and observed inventory trajectories without explicit dynamic equations. To solve this problem, we propose the Supply Chain Resilience Inference Hypergraph Network (SC-RIHN), a novel hypergraph-based model leveraging set-based encoding and hypergraph message passing to capture multi-party firm-product interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SC-RIHN significantly outperforms traditional MLP, representative graph neural network variants, and ResInf baselines across synthetic benchmarks, underscoring its potential for practical, early-warning risk assessment in complex supply chain systems.</p></details> |  |

Structure-based pre-training methods are under-explored yet crucial for downstream applications which rely on underlying graph structure. In addition, pre-training traditional message passing GNNs to capture global and regional structure is often challenging due to the risk of oversmoothing as network depth increases. We address these gaps by proposing the Laplacian Eigenvector Learning Module (LELM), a novel pre-training module for graph neural networks (GNNs) based on predicting the low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Moreover, LELM introduces a novel architecture that overcomes oversmoothing, allowing the GNN model to learn long-range interdependencies. Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform baseline models on downstream molecular property prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches typically represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow, especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale generalized planning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in International Journal of Control, Automation, and Systems (IJCAS).

Traditionally, relational data has been a source of various insights, but with the increase in computational power and the need to understand deeper relationships between entities, the need to design new techniques has arisen. For this graph data analysis has become an extraordinary tool for understanding the data, which reveals more realistic and flexible modelling of complex relationships. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, drug discovery, and more. However, many adversarial attacks can happen over the data, whether during training (poisoning attack) or during testing (evasion attack), which can adversely manipulate the desired outcome from the GNN model. Therefore, it is crucial to make the GNNs robust to such attacks. The existing robustness methods are computationally demanding and perform poorly when the intensity of attack increases. This paper presents a computationally efficient framework, namely, pLAPGNN, based on weighted p-Laplacian for making GNNs robust. Empirical evaluation on real datasets establishes the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 5th Workshop on Graphs and more Complex Structures For Learning and Reasoning (GCLR), The 40th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26)</p></details> |

This non-invasive method has gained traction across diverse domains, including telemedicine, affective computing, driver fatigue detection, and health monitoring, owing to its scalability and convenience. Despite significant progress in remote physiological signal measurement, a crucial characteristic - the intrinsic periodicity - has often been underexplored or insufficiently modeled in previous approaches, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics under real-world conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose Reperio-rPPG, a novel framework that strategically integrates Relational Convolutional Networks with a Graph Transformer to effectively capture the periodic structure inherent in physiological signals. Additionally, recognizing the limited diversity of existing rPPG datasets, we further introduce a tailored CutMix augmentation to enhance the model's generalizability. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used benchmark datasets - PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD - demonstrate that Reperio-rPPG not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits remarkable robustness under various motion (e.g., stationary, rotation, talking, walking) and illumination conditions (e.g., nature, low LED, high LED).

However, existing methods face the problem of coarse-grained graph fusion. Specifically, current approaches typically generate a separate graph structure for each view and then perform weighted fusion of graph structures at the view level, which is a relatively rough strategy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks.
