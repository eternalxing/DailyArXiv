| **[Differences That Matter: Auditing Models for Capability Gap Discovery and Rectification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16921v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart. Our results suggest that as data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://auditdm.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[AdaTooler-V: Adaptive Tool-Use for Images and Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16918v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) benefit from multimodal interleaved chain-of-thought (CoT) with vision tool interactions. However, existing open-source models often exhibit blind tool-use reasoning patterns, invoking vision tools even when they are unnecessary, which significantly increases inference overhead and degrades model performance. To this end, we propose AdaTooler-V, an MLLM that performs adaptive tool-use by determining whether a visual problem truly requires tools. First, we introduce AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on the Tool Benefit Score of each sample, encouraging the model to invoke tools only when they provide genuine improvements. Moreover, we construct two datasets to support training: AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k for SFT cold start and AdaTooler-V-300k for RL with verifiable rewards across single-image, multi-image, and video data. Experiments across twelve benchmarks demonstrate the strong reasoning capability of AdaTooler-V, outperforming existing methods in diverse visual reasoning tasks. Notably, AdaTooler-V-7B achieves an accuracy of 89.8\% on the high-resolution benchmark V*, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. All code, models, and data are released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/CYWang735/AdaTooler-V</p></details> |
| **[Generative Adversarial Reasoner: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16917v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities excel at mathematical reasoning yet still commit process errors, such as incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and superficially plausible but invalid steps. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0). The modular discriminator also enables flexible reward shaping for objectives such as teacher distillation, preference alignment, and mathematical proof-based reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploration v.s. Exploitation: Rethinking RLVR through Clipping, Entropy, and Spurious Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16912v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[Posterior Behavioral Cloning: Pretraining BC Policies for Efficient RL Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16911v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard practice across domains from robotics to language is to first pretrain a policy on a large-scale demonstration dataset, and then finetune this policy, typically with reinforcement learning (RL), in order to improve performance on deployment domains. This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning.</p></details> |  |
| **[MomaGraph: State-Aware Unified Scene Graphs with Vision-Language Model for Embodied Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16909v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile manipulators in households must both navigate and manipulate. This requires a compact, semantically rich scene representation that captures where objects are, how they function, and which parts are actionable. Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and functional relations, treats scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlooks information most relevant for accomplishing the current task. To address these limitations, we introduce MomaGraph, a unified scene representation for embodied agents that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements. However, advancing such a representation requires both suitable data and rigorous evaluation, which have been largely missing. We thus contribute MomaGraph-Scenes, the first large-scale dataset of richly annotated, task-driven scene graphs in household environments, along with MomaGraph-Bench, a systematic evaluation suite spanning six reasoning capabilities from high-level planning to fine-grained scene understanding. Built upon this foundation, we further develop MomaGraph-R1, a 7B vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning on MomaGraph-Scenes. MomaGraph-R1 predicts task-oriented scene graphs and serves as a zero-shot task planner under a Graph-then-Plan framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models, reaching 71.6% accuracy on the benchmark (+11.4% over the best baseline), while generalizing across public benchmarks and transferring effectively to real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures.

| **[AdaSearch: Balancing Parametric Knowledge and Search in Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16883v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equipping large language models (LLMs) with search engines via reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for building search agents. However, overreliance on search introduces unnecessary cost and risks exposure to noisy or malicious content, while relying solely on parametric knowledge risks hallucination. The central challenge is to develop agents that adaptively balance parametric knowledge with external search, invoking search only when necessary. Prior work mitigates search overuse by shaping rewards around the number of tool calls. However, these penalties require substantial reward engineering, provide ambiguous credit assignment, and can be exploited by agents that superficially reduce calls. Moreover, evaluating performance solely through call counts conflates necessary and unnecessary search, obscuring the measurement of true adaptive behavior. To address these limitations, we first quantify the self-knowledge awareness of existing search agents via an F1-based decision metric, revealing that methods such as Search-R1 often overlook readily available parametric knowledge. Motivated by these findings, we propose AdaSearch, a simple two-stage, outcome-driven RL framework that disentangles problem solving from the decision of whether to invoke search, and makes this decision process explicit and interpretable. This transparency is crucial for high-stakes domains such as finance and medical question answering, yet is largely neglected by prior approaches. Experiments across multiple model families and sizes demonstrate that AdaSearch substantially improves knowledge-boundary awareness, reduces unnecessary search calls, preserves strong task performance, and offers more transparent, interpretable decision behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[RePlan: Reasoning-guided Region Planning for Complex Instruction-based Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16864v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-based image editing enables natural-language control over visual modifications, yet existing models falter under Instruction-Visual Complexity (IV-Complexity), where intricate instructions meet cluttered or ambiguous scenes. We introduce RePlan (Region-aligned Planning), a plan-then-execute framework that couples a vision-language planner with a diffusion editor. The planner decomposes instructions via step-by-step reasoning and explicitly grounds them to target regions; the editor then applies changes using a training-free attention-region injection mechanism, enabling precise, parallel multi-region edits without iterative inpainting. To strengthen planning, we apply GRPO-based reinforcement learning using 1K instruction-only examples, yielding substantial gains in reasoning fidelity and format reliability. We further present IV-Edit, a benchmark focused on fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits. Across IV-Complex settings, RePlan consistently outperforms strong baselines trained on far larger datasets, improving regional precision and overall fidelity.

| **[ReinforceGen: Hybrid Skill Policies with Automated Data Generation and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16861v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon manipulation has been a long-standing challenge in the robotics community. We propose ReinforceGen, a system that combines task decomposition, data generation, imitation learning, and motion planning to form an initial solution, and improves each component through reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning. ReinforceGen first segments the task into multiple localized skills, which are connected through motion planning. The skills and motion planning targets are trained with imitation learning on a dataset generated from 10 human demonstrations, and then fine-tuned through online adaptation and reinforcement learning. When benchmarked on the Robosuite dataset, ReinforceGen reaches 80% success rate on all tasks with visuomotor controls in the highest reset range setting. Additional ablation studies show that our fine-tuning approaches contributes to an 89% average performance increase.

| **[Meta-RL Induces Exploration in Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16848v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled the training of large language model (LLM) agents to interact with the environment and to solve multi-turn long-horizon tasks. However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-error experiences. In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents. Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coordinated Anti-Jamming Resilience in Swarm Networks via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16813v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reactive jammers pose a severe security threat to robotic-swarm networks by selectively disrupting inter-agent communications and undermining formation integrity and mission success. Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoVista: Web-Augmented Agentic Visual Reasoning for Geolocalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15705v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research on agentic visual reasoning enables deep multimodal understanding but primarily focuses on image manipulation tools, leaving a gap toward more general-purpose agentic models. In this work, we revisit the geolocalization task, which requires not only nuanced visual grounding but also web search to confirm or refine hypotheses during reasoning. Since existing geolocalization benchmarks fail to meet the need for high-resolution imagery and the localization challenge for deep agentic reasoning, we curate GeoBench, a benchmark that includes photos and panoramas from around the world, along with a subset of satellite images of different cities to rigorously evaluate the geolocalization ability of agentic models. We also propose GeoVista, an agentic model that seamlessly integrates tool invocation within the reasoning loop, including an image-zoom-in tool to magnify regions of interest and a web-search tool to retrieve related web information. We develop a complete training pipeline for it, including a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage to learn reasoning patterns and tool-use priors, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) stage to further enhance reasoning ability. We adopt a hierarchical reward to leverage multi-level geographical information and improve overall geolocalization performance. Experimental results show that GeoVista surpasses other open-source agentic models on the geolocalization task greatly and achieves performance comparable to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-flash and GPT-5 on most metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[V-Thinker: Interactive Thinking with Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04460v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs. To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1) a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing image-interactive reasoning applications.</p></details> | Working in progress |
| **[Olaf: Bringing an Animated Character to Life in the Physical World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16705v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animated characters often move in non-physical ways and have proportions that are far from a typical walking robot. This provides an ideal platform for innovation in both mechanical design and stylized motion control. In this paper, we bring Olaf to life in the physical world, relying on reinforcement learning guided by animation references for control. To create the illusion of Olaf's feet moving along his body, we hide two asymmetric legs under a soft foam skirt. To fit actuators inside the character, we use spherical and planar linkages in the arms, mouth, and eyes. Because the walk cycle results in harsh contact sounds, we introduce additional rewards that noticeably reduce impact noise. The large head, driven by small actuators in the character's slim neck, creates a risk of overheating, amplified by the costume. To keep actuators from overheating, we feed temperature values as additional inputs to policies, introducing new rewards to keep them within bounds. We validate the efficacy of our modeling in simulation and on hardware, demonstrating an unmatched level of believability for a costumed robotic character.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the Performance Ceiling in Reinforcement Learning requires Inference Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21236v3)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) systems have countless applications, from energy-grid management to protein design. However, such real-world scenarios are often extremely difficult, combinatorial in nature, and require complex coordination between multiple agents. This level of complexity can cause even state-of-the-art RL systems, trained until convergence, to hit a performance ceiling which they are unable to break out of with zero-shot inference. Meanwhile, many digital or simulation-based applications allow for an inference phase that utilises a specific time and compute budget to explore multiple attempts before outputting a final solution. In this work, we show that such an inference phase employed at execution time, and the choice of a corresponding inference strategy, are key to breaking the performance ceiling observed in complex multi-agent RL problems. Our main result is striking: we can obtain up to a 126% and, on average, a 45% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art across 17 tasks, using only a couple seconds of extra wall-clock time during execution. We also demonstrate promising compute scaling properties, supported by over 60k experiments, making it the largest study on inference strategies for complex RL to date. Our experimental data and code are available at https://sites.google.com/view/inference-strategies-rl.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips '25 version (post conference)</p></details> |
| **[JustRL: Scaling a 1.5B LLM with a Simple RL Recipe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16649v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning for large language models have converged on increasing complexity: multi-stage training pipelines, dynamic hyperparameter schedules, and curriculum learning strategies. This raises a fundamental question: \textbf{Is this complexity necessary?} We present \textbf{JustRL}, a minimal approach using single-stage training with fixed hyperparameters that achieves state-of-the-art performance on two 1.5B reasoning models (54.9\% and 64.3\% average accuracy across nine mathematical benchmarks) while using 2$\times$ less compute than sophisticated approaches. The same hyperparameters transfer across both models without tuning, and training exhibits smooth, monotonic improvement over 4,000+ steps without the collapses or plateaus that typically motivate interventions. Critically, ablations reveal that adding ``standard tricks'' like explicit length penalties and robust verifiers may degrade performance by collapsing exploration. These results suggest that the field may be adding complexity to solve problems that disappear with a stable, scaled-up baseline. We release our models and code to establish a simple, validated baseline for the community.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

Utilizing the CRISP-DM methodology, the system processes a curated Islam QA dataset of 25,000 question-answer pairs from authentic sources like the Qur'an, Hadith, and scholarly fatwas, formatted in JSON for flexibility and scalability. The chatbot prototype, developed with a Flask API backend and Flutter-based mobile frontend, achieves 87% semantic accuracy in functional testing across diverse topics including fiqh, aqidah, ibadah, and muamalah, demonstrating its potential to enhance religious literacy, digital da'wah, and access to verified Islamic knowledge in the Industry 4.0 era. While effective for closed-domain queries, limitations such as static learning and dataset dependency highlight opportunities for future enhancements like continuous adaptation and multi-turn conversation support, positioning this innovation as a bridge between traditional Islamic scholarship and modern AI-driven consultation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stackelberg Learning from Human Feedback: Preference Optimization as a Sequential Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16626v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Stackelberg Learning from Human Feedback (SLHF), a new framework for preference optimization. SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 tables, 1 figures</p></details> |
| **[Non-Asymptotic Global Convergence of PPO-Clip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16565v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained attention for aligning large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The actor-only variants of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are widely applied for their efficiency. These algorithms incorporate a clipping mechanism to improve stability. Besides, a regularization term, such as the reverse KL-divergence or a more general \(f\)-divergence, is introduced to prevent policy drift. Despite their empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the problem and the algorithm's properties is limited. This paper advances the theoretical foundations of the PPO-Clip algorithm by analyzing a deterministic actor-only PPO algorithm within the general RL setting with \(f\)-divergence regularization under the softmax policy parameterization. We derive a non-uniform Lipschitz smoothness condition and a Łojasiewicz inequality for the considered problem. Based on these, a non-asymptotic linear convergence rate to the globally optimal policy is established for the forward KL-regularizer. Furthermore, stationary convergence and local linear convergence are derived for the reverse KL-regularizer.</p></details> |  |

Because of this combinatorial explosion, artists typically rely on extensive manual trial-and-error, leaving many potentially interesting configurations undiscovered. In this work we make two contributions. First, we introduce ParamExplorer, an interactive and modular framework inspired by reinforcement learning that helps the exploration of parameter spaces in generative art algorithms, guided by human-in-the-loop or even automated feedback. The framework also integrates seamlessly with existing p5.js projects. Second, within this framework we implement and evaluate several exploration strategies, referred to as agents.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |
| **[UAMDP: Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process for Risk-Constrained Reinforcement Learning from Probabilistic Forecasts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08226v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential decisions in volatile, high-stakes settings require more than maximizing expected return; they require principled uncertainty management. This paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP), a unified framework that couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling reinforcement learning, and planning under a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) constraint. In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent dynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes policies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions. We evaluate UAMDP in two domains including high-frequency equity trading and retail inventory control, both marked by structural uncertainty and economic volatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25% and sMAPE by 32%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe ratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved. These results show that integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, exploration aligned with posterior uncertainty, and risk-aware control yields a robust, generalizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding Perception-Reasoning Closer to Human in Blind Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16484v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans assess image quality through a perception-reasoning cascade, integrating sensory cues with implicit reasoning to form self-consistent judgments. In this work, we investigate how a model can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning capability for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). We first collect human evaluation data that capture several aspects of human perception-reasoning pipeline. Then, we adopt reinforcement learning, using human annotations as reward signals to guide the model toward human-like perception and reasoning. To enable the model to internalize self-consistent reasoning capability, we design a reward that drives the model to infer the image quality purely from self-generated descriptions. Empirically, our approach achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems under general metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. In addition to the rating score, we assess human-model alignment using ROUGE-1 to measure the similarity between model-generated and human perception-reasoning chains. On over 1,000 human-annotated samples, our model reaches a ROUGE-1 score of 0.512 (cf. 0.443 for baseline), indicating substantial coverage of human explanations and marking a step toward human-like interpretable reasoning in BIQA.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Asymptotic regularity of a generalised stochastic Halpern scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04845v3)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide abstract, general and highly uniform rates of asymptotic regularity for a generalized stochastic Halpern-style iteration, which incorporates a second mapping in the style of a Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. This iteration is general in two ways: First, it incorporates stochasticity completely abstractly, rather than fixing a sampling method; second, it includes as special cases stochastic versions of various schemes from the optimization literature, including Halpern's iteration as well as a Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration with Tikhonov regularization terms in the sense of Boţ, Csetnek and Meier (where this stochastic variant of the latter is considered for the first time in this paper). For these specific cases, we obtain linear rates of asymptotic regularity, matching (or improving) the currently best known rates for these iterations in stochastic optimization, and quadratic rates of asymptotic regularity are obtained in the context of inner product spaces for the general iteration. We conclude by discussing how variance can be managed in practice through sampling methods in the style of minibatching, how our convergence rates can be adapted to provide oracle complexity bounds, and by sketching how the schemes presented here can be instantiated in the context of reinforcement learning to yield novel methods for Q-learning.</p></details> | 33 pages |
| **[Mirror Descent Policy Optimisation for Robust Constrained Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23165v4)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes, making use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser) and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian representing a constrained Markov decision process. Our proposed algorithm obtains an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/T^{1/3}\right)$ convergence rate in the sample-based robust constrained Markov decision process setting. The paper also contributes an algorithm for approximate gradient descent in the space of transition kernels, which is of independent interest for designing adversarial environments in general Markov decision processes. Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation algorithms.</p></details> |  |

However, current VLM-based methods are essentially "blind", as they lack the environmental perception required to navigate complex terrain. We present E-SDS (Environment-aware See it, Do it, Sorted), a framework that closes this perception gap. E-SDS integrates VLMs with real-time terrain sensor analysis to automatically generate reward functions that facilitate training of robust perceptive locomotion policies, grounded by example videos. Evaluated on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four distinct terrains (simple, gaps, obstacles, stairs), E-SDS uniquely enabled successful stair descent, while policies trained with manually-designed rewards or a non-perceptive automated baseline were unable to complete the task. In all terrains, E-SDS also reduced velocity tracking error by 51.9-82.6%. Our framework reduces the human effort of reward design from days to less than two hours while simultaneously producing more robust and capable locomotion policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables.

However, imaginary opponents of MARL algorithms are practically configured and controlled in a fixed built-in AI mode, which causes less diversity and versatility in algorithm evaluation. To address this issue, in this work, we establish a multi-agent algorithm-vs-algorithm environment, named StarCraft II battle arena (SC2BA), to refresh the benchmarking of MARL algorithms in an adversary paradigm. Taking StarCraft as infrastructure, the SC2BA environment is specifically created for inter-algorithm adversary with the consideration of fairness, usability and customizability, and meantime an adversarial PyMARL (APyMARL) library is developed with easy-to-use interfaces/modules. Grounding in SC2BA, we benchmark those classic MARL algorithms in two types of adversarial modes: dual-algorithm paired adversary and multi-algorithm mixed adversary, where the former conducts the adversary of pairwise algorithms while the latter focuses on the adversary to multiple behaviors from a group of algorithms. The extensive benchmark experiments exhibit some thought-provoking observations/problems in the effectivity, sensibility and scalability of these completed algorithms. The SC2BA environment as well as reproduced experiments are released in \href{https://github.com/dooliu/SC2BA}{Github}, and we believe that this work could mark a new step for the MARL field in the coming years.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Models That Prove Their Own Correctness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15722v4)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we trust the correctness of a learned model on a particular input of interest? Model accuracy is typically measured on average over a distribution of inputs, giving no guarantee for any fixed input. This paper proposes a theoretically-founded solution to this problem: to train Self-Proving models that prove the correctness of their output to a verification algorithm $V$ via an Interactive Proof. Self-Proving models satisfy that, with high probability over an input sampled from a given distribution, the model generates a correct output and successfully proves its correctness to $V$. The soundness property of $V$ guarantees that, for every input, no model can convince $V$ of the correctness of an incorrect output. Thus, a Self-Proving model proves correctness of most of its outputs, while all incorrect outputs (of any model) are detected by $V$. We devise and analyze two generic methods for learning Self-Proving models: Transcript Learning (TL) which relies on access to transcripts of accepting interactions, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback (RLVF) which trains a model by emulating interactions with the verifier.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, existing research faces two limitations: (1) the high complexity of optimizing water-nitrogen combinations during crop growth and poor yield optimization results; and (2) the difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals and the delayed feedback, which results in less precise dynamic regulation of water and nitrogen and lower resource utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method. The parent agent in NDRL identifies promising macroscopic irrigation and fertilization actions based on projected cumulative yield benefits, reducing ineffective explorationwhile maintaining alignment between objectives and yield. The child agent's reward function incorporates quantified Water Stress Factor (WSF) and Nitrogen Stress Factor (NSF), and uses a mixed probability distribution to dynamically optimize daily strategies, thereby enhancing both yield and resource efficiency. We used field experiment data from 2023 and 2024 to calibrate and validate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate real-world conditions and interact with NDRL. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the best baseline, the simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both 2023 and 2024, the irrigation water productivity increased by 5.6% and 5.1% respectively, and the nitrogen partial factor productivity increased by 6.3% and 1.0% respectively. Our method advances the development of cotton irrigation and nitrogen fertilization, providing new ideas for addressing the complexity and precision issues in agricultural resource management and for sustainable agricultural development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICONIP 2025</p></details> |

We propose Self-Referential Graph HyperNetworks, systems where the very machinery of variation and inheritance is embedded within the network. By uniting hypernetworks, stochastic parameter generation, and graph-based representations, Self-Referential GHNs mutate and evaluate themselves while adapting mutation rates as selectable traits. Through new reinforcement learning benchmarks with environmental shifts (CartPoleSwitch, LunarLander-Switch), Self-Referential GHNs show swift, reliable adaptation and emergent population dynamics. In the locomotion benchmark Ant-v5, they evolve coherent gaits, showing promising fine-tuning capabilities by autonomously decreasing variation in the population to concentrate around promising solutions. Our findings support the idea that evolvability itself can emerge from neural self-reference. Self-Referential GHNs reflect a step toward synthetic systems that more closely mirror biological evolution, offering tools for autonomous, open-ended learning agents.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in generative modelling, including autoregressive, diffusion, and flow-based approaches, have enabled de novo ligand design beyond the limits of enumerative screening. Yet these models often suffer from inadequate generalization, limited interpretability, and an overemphasis on binding affinity at the expense of key pharmacological properties, thereby restricting their translational utility. Here we present Trio, a molecular generation framework integrating fragment-based molecular language modeling, reinforcement learning, and Monte Carlo tree search, for effective and interpretable closed-loop targeted molecular design. Through the three key components, Trio enables context-aware fragment assembly, enforces physicochemical and synthetic feasibility, and guides a balanced search between the exploration of novel chemotypes and the exploitation of promising intermediates within protein binding pockets. Experimental results show that Trio reliably achieves chemically valid and pharmacologically enhanced ligands, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches with improved binding affinity (+7.85%), drug-likeness (+11.10%) and synthetic accessibility (+12.05%), while expanding molecular diversity more than fourfold. By combining generalization, plausibility, and interpretability, Trio establishes a closed-loop generative paradigm that redefines how chemical space can be navigated, offering a transformative foundation for the next era of AI-driven drug discovery.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures |

Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online RLHF settings. Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with overoptimization. Lastly, we discuss possible explanations for why SimPO succeeds in offline settings while Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online scenarios. Our findings suggest that reference-free approaches may face distinct challenges when applied to online or offline preference learning.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |

However, to further cultivate capabilities such as adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, training on static datasets built from human-level knowledge is insufficient. These datasets are costly to construct and lack both dynamism and realism. A growing consensus is that agents should instead interact directly with environments and learn from experience through reinforcement learning. We formalize this iterative process as the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, where environments generate tasks to challenge agents, return observations in response to agents' actions during task execution, and provide evaluative feedback on rollouts for subsequent learning. Under this paradigm, environments function as indispensable producers of experiential data, highlighting the need to scale them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity. In this survey, we systematically review representative methods for environment scaling from a pioneering environment-centric perspective and organize them along the stages of the GEF loop, namely task generation, task execution, and feedback. We further analyze implementation frameworks, challenges, and applications, consolidating fragmented advances and outlining future research directions for agent intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, SEA Workshop @ NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Surprisingly, such large gains result from updating only a small subnetwork comprising just 5 percent to 30 percent of the parameters, with the rest effectively unchanged. We refer to this phenomenon as parameter update sparsity induced by RL. It is observed across all 7 widely used RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO, DPO) and all 10 LLMs from different families in our experiments. This sparsity is intrinsic and occurs without any explicit sparsity promoting regularizations or architectural constraints. Finetuning the subnetwork alone recovers the test accuracy, and, remarkably, produces a model nearly identical to the one obtained via full finetuning. The subnetworks from different random seeds, training data, and even RL algorithms show substantially greater overlap than expected by chance. Our analysis suggests that this sparsity is not due to updating only a subset of layers, instead, nearly all parameter matrices receive similarly sparse updates. Moreover, the updates to almost all parameter matrices are nearly full-rank, suggesting RL updates a small subset of parameters that nevertheless span almost the full subspaces that the parameter matrices can represent. We conjecture that the this update sparsity can be primarily attributed to training on data that is near the policy distribution, techniques that encourage the policy to remain close to the pretrained model, such as the KL regularization and gradient clipping, have limited impact.</p></details> | NeuRIPS 2025 |
| **[Think Twice: Branch-and-Rethink Reasoning Reward Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23596v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1 performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise, evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting all-at-once scoring into focused, second-look reasoning, BR-RM reduces judgment diffusion and improves sensitivity to subtle yet consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source Code: https://github.com/yzjiao/BR-RM.

However, standard RLVR faces challenges with reward sparsity, where zero rewards from consistently incorrect candidate answers provide no learning signal, particularly in challenging tasks. To address this, we propose Multi-Expert Mutual Learning GRPO (MEML-GRPO), an innovative framework that utilizes diverse expert prompts as system prompts to generate a broader range of responses, substantially increasing the likelihood of identifying correct solutions. Additionally, we introduce an inter-expert mutual learning mechanism that facilitates knowledge sharing and transfer among experts, further boosting the model's performance through RLVR. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that MEML-GRPO delivers significant improvements, achieving an average performance gain of 4.89% with Qwen and 11.33% with Llama, effectively overcoming the core limitations of traditional RLVR methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Alignment of Medical Vision-Language Models for Grounded Radiology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16201v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is a critical step toward automating healthcare workflows, facilitating accurate patient assessments, and reducing the workload of medical professionals. Despite recent progress in Large Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), generating radiology reports that are both visually grounded and clinically accurate remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on large labeled corpora for pre-training, costly task-specific preference data, or retrieval-based methods. However, these strategies do not adequately mitigate hallucinations arising from poor cross-modal alignment between visual and linguistic representations. To address these limitations, we propose VALOR:Visual Alignment of Medical Vision-Language Models for GrOunded Radiology Report Generation. Our method introduces a reinforcement learning-based post-alignment framework utilizing Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO). The training proceeds in two stages: (1) improving the Med-VLM with textual rewards to encourage clinically precise terminology, and (2) aligning the vision projection module of the textually grounded model with disease findings, thereby guiding attention toward image re gions most relevant to the diagnostic task. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VALOR substantially improves factual accuracy and visual grounding, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art report generation methods.</p></details> |  |

Despite these achievements, their application to finance remains challenging, due to fragmented data sources, intransparent reasoning processes, and weak transferability to business applications. In response, we introduce Fin-R1, a reasoning LLM designed for financial scenarios. With a compact size of 7 billion parameters, Fin-R1 reduces deployment costs while addressing the aforementioned challenges. Its development follows a two-stage pipeline. First, we construct Fin-R1-Data, a high-quality financial dataset consisting of 60,091 chain-of-thought (CoT) samples, distilled and filtered from multiple authoritative benchmarks to ensure consistency and reliability. Second, we train Fin-R1 using Fin-R1-Data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by reinforcement learning (RL). This stage substantially improves the model's ability to solve complex financial reasoning tasks, yielding outputs that are both accurate and interpretable. Despite its relatively small parameter scale, Fin-R1 achieves competitive empirical performance across established financial benchmarks and demonstrates practical utility in compliance checking and robo-advisory. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/SUFE-AIFLM-Lab/Fin-R1, and has already attracted over 700 stars.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often generate text that mimics the linguistic style of radiologists but fails to guarantee clinical correctness, because they are trained on token-level objectives which focus on word-choice and sentence structure rather than actual medical accuracy. We propose a semantic-driven reinforcement learning (SRL) method for medical report generation, adopted on a large vision-language model (LVLM). SRL adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage clinical-correctness-guided learning beyond imitation of language style. Specifically, we optimise a report-level reward: a margin-based cosine similarity (MCCS) computed between key radiological findings extracted from generated and reference reports, thereby directly aligning clinical-label agreement and improving semantic correctness. A lightweight reasoning format constraint further guides the model to generate structured "thinking report" outputs. We evaluate Medical Report Generation with Sematic-driven Reinforment Learning (MRG-R1), on two datasets: IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR using clinical efficacy (CE) metrics. MRG-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with CE-F1 51.88 on IU X-Ray and 40.39 on MIMIC-CXR. We found that the label-semantic reinforcement is better than conventional token-level supervision. These results indicate that optimizing a clinically grounded, report-level reward rather than token overlap,meaningfully improves clinical correctness. This work is a prior to explore semantic-reinforcement in supervising medical correctness in medical Large vision-language model(Med-LVLM) training.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Despite progress in existing methods, the inherent modality heterogeneity limits the effective capture of interactive sentiment features across modalities. In this paper, by introducing a Multi-Modality Collaborative Learning (MMCL) framework, we facilitate cross-modal interactions and capture enhanced and complementary features from modality-common and modality-specific representations, respectively. Specifically, we design a parameter-free decoupling module and separate uni-modality into modality-common and modality-specific components through semantics assessment of cross-modal elements. For modality-specific representations, inspired by the act-reward mechanism in reinforcement learning, we design policy models to adaptively mine complementary sentiment features under the guidance of a joint reward. For modality-common representations, intra-modal attention is employed to highlight crucial components, playing enhanced roles among modalities. Experimental results, including superiority evaluations on four databases, effectiveness verification of each module, and assessment of complementary features, demonstrate that MMCL successfully learns collaborative features across modalities and significantly improves performance.

However, this voting strategy often induces confirmation bias and suffers from sparse rewards, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we propose subgroup-specific step-wise confidence-weighted pseudo-label estimation (SCOPE), a framework integrating model confidence and dynamic subgroup partitioning to address these issues. Specifically, SCOPE integrates the proposed step-wise confidence into pseudo label deduction, prioritizing high-quality reasoning paths over simple frequency count. Furthermore, it dynamically partitions the candidate outputs pool into independent subgroups by balancing reasoning quality against exploration diversity. By deriving local consensus via repeat sampling for each sub group, SCOPE provides diverse supervision targets to encourage broader exploration. We conduct experiments across various models and benchmarks, experimental results show that SCOPE consistently outperforms recent baselines. Notably, SCOPE achieving relative improvements of 13.1% on challenging AIME 2025 and 8.1% on AMC. The code is released at https://github.com/szu-tera/SCOPE.</p></details> |  |

These models constitute the large majority of training compute and time and they are subsequently used to train actors entirely in simulation, but once this is done they are quickly discarded. We show in this work that utilising these models at inference time can significantly boost sample efficiency. We propose a novel approach that anticipates and actively seeks out informative states using the world model's short-horizon latent predictions, offering a principled alternative to traditional curiosity-driven methods that chase outdated estimates of high uncertainty states. While many model predictive control (MPC) based methods offer similar alternatives, they typically lack commitment, synthesising multiple multi-step plans at every step. To mitigate this, we present a hierarchical planner that dynamically decides when to replan, planning horizon length, and the commitment to searching entropy. While our method can theoretically be applied to any model that trains its own actors with solely model generated data, we have applied it to Dreamer to illustrate the concept. Our method finishes MiniWorld's procedurally generated mazes 50% faster than base Dreamer at convergence and in only 60% of the environment steps that base Dreamer's policy needs; it displays reasoned exploratory behaviour in Crafter, achieves the same reward as base Dreamer in a third of the steps; planning tends to improve sample efficiency on DeepMind Control tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages without appendix, 15 Figures, preprint</p></details> |

However, they suffer from diseconomies of scale, and their financial viability remains unconvincing. One step in addressing this shortcoming is to design these reactors with comprehensive economic and physics analyses informing early-stage design iteration. In this work, we present a novel unifying geometric design optimization approach that accounts for techno-economic considerations. We start by generating random samples to train surrogate models, including Gaussian processes (GPs) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We then deploy these surrogates within a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization framework to optimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), all the while imposing constraints on the fuel lifetime, shutdown margin (SDM), peak heat flux, and rod-integrated peaking factor. We study two cases: one in which the axial reflector cost is very high, and one in which it is inexpensive. We found that the operation and maintenance and capital costs are the primary contributors to the overall LCOE particularly the cost of the axial reflectors (for the first case) and the control drum materials. The optimizer cleverly changes the design parameters so as to minimize one of them while still satisfying the constraints, ultimately reducing the LCOE by more than 57% in both instances. A comprehensive integration of fuel and HP performance with multi-objective optimization is currently being pursued to fully understand the interaction between constraints and cost performance.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure of an algorithm's propensity to forget and shows that Bayesian learners are capable of adapting without forgetting. To validate the theory, we design a comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression, generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate how forgetting is present across all deep learning settings and plays a significant role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and improving the information retention capabilities of general learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ben-sanati.github.io/forgetting-is-everywhere-project/</p></details> |

We propose Reinforcement Learning from Teacher-Model Refinement (RLfR), a novel framework that removes reliance on static triplets by leveraging continuous, high-quality feedback from an external teacher model (GPT-4o). RLfR frames each translation step as a micro-tutorial: the actor generates a hypothesis, the teacher refines it, and the actor is rewarded based on how closely it aligns with the teacher's refinement. Guided by two complementary signals--(i) negative edit distance, promoting lexical and structural fidelity, and (ii) COMET score, ensuring semantic adequacy--the actor progressively learns to emulate the teacher, mirroring a human learning process through incremental, iterative improvement. On the FLORES-200 benchmark (English to and from German, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese), RLfR consistently outperforms both MT-SFT and preference-based baselines, significantly improving COMET (semantic adequacy) and M-ETA (entity preservation) scores.</p></details> |  |

While traditional low-rank approximations often rely on static rank assumptions--limiting their flexibility across diverse input contexts--our method dynamically selects ranks based on real-time sequence dynamics, layer-specific sensitivities, and hardware constraints. The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency. Crucially, we employ online matrix perturbation bounds to enable incremental rank updates, thereby avoiding the prohibitive cost of full decomposition during inference. Furthermore, the integration of a lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations ensures scalable deployment on modern GPU architectures. Experiments demonstrate that DR-RL maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), particularly in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096). This work bridges the gap between adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor in MHSA, offering a principled, mathematically grounded alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques in resource-constrained deep learning.

| **[Small Language Models for Efficient Agentic Tool Calling: Outperforming Large Models with Targeted Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15943v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As organizations scale adoption of generative AI, model cost optimization and operational efficiency have emerged as critical factors determining sustainability and accessibility. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their extensive computational requirements make them cost-prohibitive for routine enterprise use. This limitation motivates the exploration of Small Language Models (SLMs), which can deliver comparable performance in targeted applications while drastically reducing infrastructure overhead (Irugalbandara et al., 2023). In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024). Experimental results demonstrated that our fine-tuned SLM achieves exceptional performance with a 77.55\% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming all baseline models including ChatGPT-CoT (26.00\%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18\%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27\%). These findings emphasize that thoughtful design and targeted training of SLMs can significantly lower barriers to adoption, enabling cost-effective, large-scale integration of generative AI into production systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSO: Direct Steering Optimization for Bias Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15926v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models are often deployed to make decisions on behalf of users, such as vision-language models (VLMs) identifying which person in a room is a doctor to help visually impaired individuals. Yet, VLM decisions are influenced by the perceived demographic attributes of people in the input, which can lead to biased outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that current steering methods struggle to correct biases, where equiprobable outcomes across demographic groups are required. To address this, we propose Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) which uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance. We demonstrate that DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, while offering practitioners inference-time control over the trade-off. Overall, our work highlights the benefit of designing steering strategies that are directly optimized to control model behavior, providing more effective bias intervention than methods that rely on pre-defined heuristics for controllability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Guide Their Own Exploration? Gradient-Guided Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15687v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has become essential for strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet current exploration mechanisms remain fundamentally misaligned with how these models actually learn. Entropy bonuses and external semantic comparators encourage surface level variation but offer no guarantee that sampled trajectories differ in the update directions that shape optimization. We propose G2RL, a gradient guided reinforcement learning framework in which exploration is driven not by external heuristics but by the model own first order update geometry. For each response, G2RL constructs a sequence level feature from the model final layer sensitivity, obtainable at negligible cost from a standard forward pass, and measures how each trajectory would reshape the policy by comparing these features within a sampled group. Trajectories that introduce novel gradient directions receive a bounded multiplicative reward scaler, while redundant or off manifold updates are deemphasized, yielding a self referential exploration signal that is naturally aligned with PPO style stability and KL control. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, AMC, AIME24, AIME25, GPQA, MMLUpro) on Qwen3 base 1.7B and 4B models, G2RL consistently improves pass@1, maj@16, and pass@k over entropy based GRPO and external embedding methods. Analyzing the induced geometry, we find that G2RL expands exploration into substantially more orthogonal and often opposing gradient directions while maintaining semantic coherence, revealing that a policy own update space provides a far more faithful and effective basis for guiding exploration in large language model reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stepwise Think-Critique: A Unified Framework for Robust and Interpretable LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15662v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human beings solve complex problems through critical thinking, where reasoning and evaluation are intertwined to converge toward correct solutions. However, most existing large language models (LLMs) decouple reasoning from verification: they either generate reasoning without explicit self-checking or rely on external verifiers to detect errors post hoc. The former lacks immediate feedback, while the latter increases system complexity and hinders synchronized learning. Motivated by human critical thinking, we propose Stepwise Think-Critique (STC), a unified framework that interleaves reasoning and self-critique at each step within a single model. STC is trained with a hybrid reinforcement learning objective combining reasoning rewards and critique-consistency rewards to jointly optimize reasoning quality and self-evaluation. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that STC demonstrates strong critic-thinking capabilities and produces more interpretable reasoning traces, representing a step toward LLMs with built-in critical thinking.</p></details> | Under Review |

Energy-based models (EBMs) represent another class of models, which have historically been less prevalent in LLM development, yet naturally characterize the optimal policy in post-training alignment. In this paper, we provide a unified view of these two model classes. Taking the chain rule of probability as a starting point, we establish an explicit bijection between ARMs and EBMs in function space, which we show to correspond to a special case of the soft Bellman equation in maximum entropy reinforcement learning. Building upon this bijection, we derive the equivalence between supervised learning of ARMs and EBMs. Furthermore, we analyze the distillation of EBMs into ARMs by providing theoretical error bounds. Our results provide insights into the ability of ARMs to plan ahead, despite being based on the next-token prediction paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for EH-Enabled Cognitive-IoT Under Jamming Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15558v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolving landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating cognitive radio (CR) has become a practical solution to address the challenge of spectrum scarcity, leading to the development of cognitive IoT (CIoT). However, the vulnerability of radio communications makes radio jamming attacks a key concern in CIoT networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach designed to optimize throughput and extend network lifetime of an energy-constrained CIoT system under jamming attacks. This DRL framework equips a CIoT device with the autonomy to manage energy harvesting (EH) and data transmission, while also regulating its transmit power to respect spectrum-sharing constraints. We formulate the optimization problem under various constraints, and we model the CIoT device's interactions within the channel as a model-free Markov decision process (MDP). The MDP serves as a foundation to develop a double deep Q-network (DDQN), designed to help the CIoT agent learn the optimal communication policy to navigate challenges such as dynamic channel occupancy, jamming attacks, and channel fading while achieving its goal. Additionally, we introduce a variant of the upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm, named UCB-IA, which enhances the CIoT network's ability to efficiently navigate jamming attacks within the channel. The proposed DRL algorithm does not rely on prior knowledge and uses locally observable information such as channel occupancy, jamming activity, channel gain, and energy arrival to make decisions. Extensive simulations prove that our proposed DRL algorithm that utilizes the UCB-IA strategy surpasses existing benchmarks, allowing for a more adaptive, energy-efficient, and secure spectrum sharing in CIoT networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Internet of Things Journal.

| **[Scaling Behaviors of LLM Reinforcement Learning Post-Training: An Empirical Study in Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25300v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL) post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on a set of experiments across the full Qwen2.5 dense model series (0.5B to 72B), we characterize how model scale, data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our analysis leads to four key findings: 1.Larger models consistently exhibit superior learning efficiency on both compute and data metrics. 2.The relationship between test loss, compute, and data can be modeled by a predictive power-law which is robust across both base and instruction-tuned models. 3.Although larger models exhibit higher learning efficiency, the analytical learning efficiency term k(N) in the power-law reveals a latent saturation trend in learning efficiency as model size continues to increase. 4.In data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. Collectively, these results provide a principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>V2 ve...</summary><p>V2 version:27 pages, 14 figures</p></details> |

The IFMIF-DONES facility, a high-power particle accelerator, is being designed to qualify these materials. A critical testbed for its development is the MuVacAS prototype, which replicates the final segment of the accelerator beamline. Precise regulation of argon gas pressure within its ultra-high vacuum chamber is vital for this task. This work presents a fully data-driven approach for autonomous pressure control. A Deep Learning Surrogate Model, trained on real operational data, emulates the dynamics of the argon injection system. This high-fidelity digital twin then serves as a fast-simulation environment to train a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent. The results demonstrate that the agent successfully learns a control policy that maintains gas pressure within strict operational limits despite dynamic disturbances. This approach marks a significant step toward the intelligent, autonomous control systems required for the demanding next-generation particle accelerator facilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, included in Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop @ NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15439v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) reduces the cost of real-environment sampling by generating synthetic trajectories (called rollouts) from a learned dynamics model. However, choosing the length of the rollouts poses two dilemmas: (1) Longer rollouts better preserve on-policy training but amplify model bias, indicating the need for an intermediate horizon to mitigate distribution shift (i.e., the gap between on-policy and past off-policy samples). (2) Moreover, a longer model rollout may reduce value estimation bias but raise the variance of policy gradients due to backpropagation through multiple steps, implying another intermediate horizon for stable gradient estimates. However, these two optimal horizons may differ. To resolve this conflict, we propose Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization (DHMBPO), which divides the rollout procedure into a long "distribution rollout" (DR) and a short "training rollout" (TR). The DR generates on-policy state samples for mitigating distribution shift. In contrast, the short TR leverages differentiable transitions to offer accurate value gradient estimation with stable gradient updates, thereby requiring fewer updates and reducing overall runtime. We demonstrate that the double-horizon approach effectively balances distribution shift, model bias, and gradient instability, and surpasses existing MBRL methods on continuous-control benchmarks in terms of both sample efficiency and runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) Code available at https://github.com/4kubo/erl_lib</p></details> |

However, modern RL methods still struggle with effective transferability across tasks and scenarios. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a generalized algorithm, Feature Model-Based Enhanced Actor-Critic (FM-EAC), that integrates planning, acting, and learning for multi-task control in dynamic environments. FM-EAC combines the strengths of MBRL and MFRL and improves generalizability through the use of novel feature-based models and an enhanced actor-critic framework. Simulations in both urban and agricultural applications demonstrate that FM-EAC consistently outperforms many state-of-the-art MBRL and MFRL methods. More importantly, different sub-networks can be customized within FM-EAC according to user-specific requirements.</p></details> |  |

Review on Automated Driving Systems Test Scenario Generation Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15422v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety and reliability of Automated Driving Systems (ADS) remains a critical challenge, as traditional verification methods such as large-scale on-road testing are prohibitively costly and time-consuming.To address this,scenario-based testing has emerged as a scalable and efficient alternative,yet existing surveys provide only partial coverage of recent methodological and technological advances.This review systematically analyzes 31 primary studies,and 10 surveys identified through a comprehensive search spanning 2015~2025;however,the in-depth methodological synthesis and comparative evaluation focus primarily on recent frameworks(2023~2025),reflecting the surge of Artificial Intelligent(AI)-assisted and multimodal approaches in this period.Traditional approaches rely on expert knowledge,ontologies,and naturalistic driving or accident data,while recent developments leverage generative models,including large language models,generative adversarial networks,diffusion models,and reinforcement learning frameworks,to synthesize diverse and safety-critical scenarios.Our synthesis identifies three persistent gaps:the absence of standardized evaluation metrics,limited integration of ethical and human factors,and insufficient coverage of multimodal and Operational Design Domain (ODD)-specific scenarios.To address these challenges,this review contributes a refined taxonomy that incorporates multimodal extensions,an ethical and safety checklist for responsible scenario design,and an ODD coverage map with a scenario-difficulty schema to enable transparent benchmarking.Collectively,these contributions provide methodological clarity for researchers and practical guidance for industry,supporting reproducible evaluation and accelerating the safe deployment of higher-level ADS.</p></details> | 32 pages,6 figures |

Epistemic uncertainty reflects such boundaries, representing systematic uncertainty due to limited knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, $\texttt{EUBRL}$, which leverages epistemic guidance to achieve principled exploration. This guidance adaptively reduces per-step regret arising from estimation errors. We establish nearly minimax-optimal regret and sample complexity guarantees for a class of sufficiently expressive priors in infinite-horizon discounted MDPs. Empirically, we evaluate $\texttt{EUBRL}$ on tasks characterized by sparse rewards, long horizons, and stochasticity. Results demonstrate that $\texttt{EUBRL}$ achieves superior sample efficiency, scalability, and consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Contextual Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Directed Controller Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15295v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controller synthesis is a formal method approach for automatically generating Labeled Transition System (LTS) controllers that satisfy specified properties. The efficiency of the synthesis process, however, is critically dependent on exploration policies. These policies often rely on fixed rules or strategies learned through reinforcement learning (RL) that consider only a limited set of current features. To address this limitation, this paper introduces GCRL, an approach that enhances RL-based methods by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GCRL encodes the history of LTS exploration into a graph structure, allowing it to capture a broader, non-current-based context. In a comparative experiment against state-of-the-art methods, GCRL exhibited superior learning efficiency and generalization across four out of five benchmark domains, except one particular domain characterized by high symmetry and strictly local interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Well Begun, Half Done: Reinforcement Learning with Prefix Optimization for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15274v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning. This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs. Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs. This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results. To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

MVDPDPSR is an extension of the vehicle routing problem and a spatio-temporal system optimization problem, widely applied in scenarios such as on-demand delivery. Classical operations research methods face bottlenecks in computational complexity and time efficiency when handling large-scale dynamic problems. Although existing reinforcement learning methods have achieved some progress, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Independent decoding across multiple vehicles fails to model joint action distributions; 2) The feature extraction network struggles to capture inter-entity relationships; 3) The joint action space is exponentially large. To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships. Additionally, we guide the model's decision-making using informative priors to facilitate effective exploration. Experiments on 8 datasets demonstrate that MAPT significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of performance and exhibits substantial computational time advantages compared to classical operations research methods.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Frameworks for "thinking with images" (e.g., ChatGPT-o3 and DeepEyes) show that stepwise multimodal reasoning can emerge by interleaving hypothesis formation with active acquisition of visual evidence, but they do not address three key challenges in spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT): building global space perception under strict token budgets, explicitly associating 3D hypotheses with video frames for verification, and designing spatially grounded rewards for reinforcement learning. To address these issues, we present EagleVision, a dual-stage framework for progressive spatial cognition through macro perception and micro verification. In the macro perception stage, EagleVision employs a semantics-perspective-fusion determinantal point process (SPF-DPP) to select a compact set of geometry- and semantics-aware keyframes from long videos under a fixed token budget. In the micro verification stage, we formalize spatial CoT as BEV-grounded pose querying: the agent iteratively predicts poses on a BEV plane, retrieves the nearest real frames, and is trained purely by reinforcement learning with a spatial grounding reward that scores the consistency between predicted poses and observed views. On VSI-Bench, EagleVision achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source vision-language models, demonstrating strong and generalizable spatial understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Context-adaptive meta reinforcement learning addresses these limitations by conditioning on the task representation, yet they mostly rely on complete action information in the experience making task inference tightly coupled to a specific policy. This paper introduces Context Representation via Action Free Transformer encoder decoder (CRAFT), a belief model that infers task representations solely from sequences of states and rewards. By removing the dependence on actions, CRAFT decouples task inference from policy optimization, supports modular training, and leverages amortized variational inference for scalable belief updates. Built on a transformer encoder decoder with rotary positional embeddings, the model captures long range temporal dependencies and robustly encodes both parametric and non-parametric task variations. Experiments on the MetaWorld ML-10 robotic manipulation benchmark show that CRAFT achieves faster adaptation, improved generalization, and more effective exploration compared to context adaptive meta--RL baselines. These findings highlight the potential of action-free inference as a foundation for scalable RL in robotic control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Reward Shaping from Multi-Objective Human Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15120v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective reward functions remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning, especially in multi-objective environments. In this work, we propose Multi-Objective Reward Shaping with Exploration (MORSE), a general framework that automatically combines multiple human-designed heuristic rewards into a unified reward function. MORSE formulates the shaping process as a bi-level optimization problem: the inner loop trains a policy to maximize the current shaped reward, while the outer loop updates the reward function to optimize task performance. To encourage exploration in the reward space and avoid suboptimal local minima, MORSE introduces stochasticity into the shaping process, injecting noise guided by task performance and the prediction error of a fixed, randomly initialized neural network. Experimental results in MuJoCo and Isaac Sim environments show that MORSE effectively balances multiple objectives across various robotic tasks, achieving task performance comparable to those obtained with manually tuned reward functions.</p></details> |  |

Towards that end, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has emerged as an essential architecture for enabling ubiquitous UAV connectivity. To address the pronounced disparities in coverage and signal characteristics across heterogeneous networks, this paper formulates UAV mobility management in SAGIN as a constrained multi-objective joint optimization problem. The formulation couples discrete link selection with continuous trajectory optimization. Building on this, we propose a two-level multi-agent hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework that decomposes the problem into two alternately solvable subproblems. To map complex link selection decisions into a compact discrete action space, we conceive a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm in the top-level, which achieves stable and high-quality policy learning through double Q-value estimation. To handle the continuous trajectory action space while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints, we integrate the maximum-entropy mechanism of the soft actor-critic (SAC) and employ a Lagrangian-based constrained SAC (CSAC) algorithm in the lower-level that dynamically adjusts the Lagrange multipliers to balance constraint satisfaction and policy optimization. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be extended to multi-UAV scenarios under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, which enables more generalizable policies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms existing benchmarks in throughput, link switching frequency and QoS satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods, achieving at least a 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks.</p></details> | under review |

Experiments on diverse chemical benchmarks demonstrate that ChemDFM-R achieves cutting-edge performance while providing interpretable, rationale-driven outputs.

| **[Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization Breaks The Exploration Bottleneck of Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08141v6)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet the widely adopted Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, causing exploration to vanish and policies to converge prematurely. As a result, RL is widely believed to be incapable of expanding the reasoning frontier of LLMs. Existing entropy-regularized methods introduce an inevitable trade-off between reward and entropy, leading to exploration accompanied by non-negligible optimization bias. In this work, we prove that temperature-guided REINFORCE can modulate policy entropy, and propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which reformulates entropy regularization as a policy-gradient optimization problem. Rather than manipulating entropy directly, AEPO implicitly regulates it by applying a REINFORCE regularization term on temperature-adjusted samples, ensuring that entropy is controlled but never dominates optimization, thereby enabling arbitrary and principled entropy regulation. Experiments show that AEPO outperforms RL baselines on both pass@1 and pass@$k$, and even surpasses the base model on pass@1024. By modulating entropy precisely, AEPO achieves more effective optimization dynamics and provides direct empirical evidence that entropy, exploration, and performance are intrinsically linked.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dexterous Manipulation through Imitation Learning: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03515v5)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dexterous manipulation, which refers to the ability of a robotic hand or multi-fingered end-effector to skillfully control, reorient, and manipulate objects through precise, coordinated finger movements and adaptive force modulation, enables complex interactions similar to human hand dexterity. With recent advances in robotics and machine learning, there is a growing demand for these systems to operate in complex and unstructured environments. Traditional model-based approaches struggle to generalize across tasks and object variations due to the high dimensionality and complex contact dynamics of dexterous manipulation. Although model-free methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) show promise, they require extensive training, large-scale interaction data, and carefully designed rewards for stability and effectiveness. Imitation learning (IL) offers an alternative by allowing robots to acquire dexterous manipulation skills directly from expert demonstrations, capturing fine-grained coordination and contact dynamics while bypassing the need for explicit modeling and large-scale trial-and-error.

Unreliable Results of Reinforcement Learning Due to Data Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10532v3)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning in large language models has long been a central research focus, and recent studies employing reinforcement learning (RL) have introduced diverse methods that yield substantial performance gains with minimal or even no external supervision. Surprisingly, some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance performance. However, these breakthroughs are predominantly observed for the mathematically strong Qwen2.5 series on benchmarks such as MATH-500, AMC, and AIME, and seldom transfer to models like Llama, which warrants a more in-depth investigation. In this work, our empirical analysis reveals that pre-training on massive web-scale corpora leaves Qwen2.5 susceptible to data contamination in widely used benchmarks. Consequently, conclusions derived from contaminated benchmarks on Qwen2.5 series may be unreliable. To obtain trustworthy evaluation results, we introduce a generator that creates fully clean arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, dubbed RandomCalculation. Using this leakage-free dataset, we show that only accurate reward signals yield steady improvements that surpass the base model's performance boundary in mathematical reasoning, whereas random or incorrect rewards do not. Moreover, we conduct more fine-grained analyses to elucidate the factors underlying the different performance observed on the MATH-500 and RandomCalculation benchmarks. Consequently, we recommend that future studies evaluate models on uncontaminated benchmarks and, when feasible, test various model series to ensure trustworthy conclusions about RL and related methods.</p></details> | 28 pages, AAAI 2026 |
| **[Spectral Representation-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15036v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications with large state and action spaces, reinforcement learning (RL) typically employs function approximations to represent core components like the policies, value functions, and dynamics models. Although powerful approximations such as neural networks offer great expressiveness, they often present theoretical ambiguities, suffer from optimization instability and exploration difficulty, and incur substantial computational costs in practice. In this paper, we introduce the perspective of spectral representations as a solution to address these difficulties in RL. Stemming from the spectral decomposition of the transition operator, this framework yields an effective abstraction of the system dynamics for subsequent policy optimization while also providing a clear theoretical characterization. We reveal how to construct spectral representations for transition operators that possess latent variable structures or energy-based structures, which implies different learning methods to extract spectral representations from data. Notably, each of these learning methods realizes an effective RL algorithm under this framework. We also provably extend this spectral view to partially observable MDPs. Finally, we validate these algorithms on over 20 challenging tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, where they achieve performances comparable or superior to current state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Financial Portfolio Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14992v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DRL agents circumvent the issue of classic models in the sense that they do not make assumptions like the financial returns being normally distributed and are able to deal with any information like the ESG score if they are configured to gain a reward that makes an objective better. However, the performance of DRL agents has high variability and it is very sensible to the value of their hyperparameters. Bayesian optimization is a class of methods that are suited to the optimization of black-box functions, that is, functions whose analytical expression is unknown, are noisy and expensive to evaluate. The hyperparameter tuning problem of DRL algorithms perfectly suits this scenario. As training an agent just for one objective is a very expensive period, requiring millions of timesteps, instead of optimizing an objective being a mixture of a risk-performance metric and an ESG metric, we choose to separate the objective and solve the multi-objective scenario to obtain an optimal Pareto set of portfolios representing the best tradeoff between the Sharpe ratio and the ESG mean score of the portfolio and leaving to the investor the choice of the final portfolio. We conducted our experiments using environments encoded within the OpenAI Gym, adapted from the FinRL platform. The experiments are carried out in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the NASDAQ markets in terms of the Sharpe ratio achieved by the agent and the mean ESG score of the portfolio. We compare the performance of the obtained Pareto sets in hypervolume terms illustrating how portfolios are the best trade-off between the Sharpe ratio and mean ESG score. Also, we show the usefulness of our proposed methodology by comparing the obtained hypervolume with one achieved by a Random Search methodology on the DRL hyperparameter space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Partitioning and Learning for Stochastic Control of Diffusion Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14991v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study reinforcement learning for controlled diffusion processes with unbounded continuous state spaces, bounded continuous actions, and polynomially growing rewards: settings that arise naturally in finance, economics, and operations research. To overcome the challenges of continuous and high-dimensional domains, we introduce a model-based algorithm that adaptively partitions the joint state-action space. The algorithm maintains estimators of drift, volatility, and rewards within each partition, refining the discretization whenever estimation bias exceeds statistical confidence. This adaptive scheme balances exploration and approximation, enabling efficient learning in unbounded domains. Our analysis establishes regret bounds that depend on the problem horizon, state dimension, reward growth order, and a newly defined notion of zooming dimension tailored to unbounded diffusion processes. The bounds recover existing results for bounded settings as a special case, while extending theoretical guarantees to a broader class of diffusion-type problems. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments, including applications to high-dimensional problems such as multi-asset mean-variance portfolio selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stronger-MAS: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Collaborative LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11062v4)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However, applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and multi-policy models. We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single- and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks, AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5 percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to 7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math. Code and environments are available at: https://github.com/pettingllms-ai/PettingLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Puzzle Curriculum GRPO for Vision-Centric Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14944v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches like outcome-supervised GRPO have advanced chain-of-thought reasoning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), yet key issues linger: (i) reliance on costly and noisy hand-curated annotations or external verifiers; (ii) flat and sparse reward schemes in GRPO; and (iii) logical inconsistency between a chain's reasoning and its final answer. We present Puzzle Curriculum GRPO (PC-GRPO), a supervision-free recipe for RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) that strengthens visual reasoning in VLMs without annotations or external verifiers. PC-GRPO replaces labels with three self-supervised puzzle environments: PatchFit, Rotation (with binary rewards) and Jigsaw (with graded partial credit mitigating reward sparsity). To counter flat rewards and vanishing group-relative advantages, we introduce a difficulty-aware curriculum that dynamically weights samples and peaks at medium difficulty. We further monitor Reasoning-Answer Consistency (RAC) during post-training: mirroring reports for vanilla GRPO in LLMs, RAC typically rises early then degrades; our curriculum delays this decline, and consistency-enforcing reward schemes further boost RAC. RAC correlates with downstream accuracy. Across diverse benchmarks and on Qwen-7B and Qwen-3B backbones, PC-GRPO improves reasoning quality, training stability, and end-task accuracy, offering a practical path to scalable, verifiable, and interpretable RL post-training for VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pcgrpo.github.io</p></details> |
| **[How Reinforcement Learning After Next-Token Prediction Facilitates Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11495v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings, including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection: An Information-Geometric Unification of Model Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14879v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-referential learning -- training a model on data it generated itself -- promises boundless scalability but chronically suffers from model collapse: language models degenerate into repetitive text, GANs drop modes, and reinforcement-learning policies over-exploit. Although practitioners employ ad~hoc fixes such as real-data mixing, entropy bonuses, knowledge distillation, or retrieval-augmented generation, a single principle that explains both the failure mode and the success of these fixes has remained elusive. We present Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection (ERBP), an information-geometric framework that unifies these phenomena. We model the closed loop as a stochastic Bregman projection sequence in distribution space. Without external coupling, finite-sample noise forces the system to project onto an ever-shrinking empirical support, causing exponential entropy decay and eventual collapse. Introducing an Entropy Reservoir -- a high-entropy distribution mixed into each projection -- injects a controllable entropy flux that provably stabilises the dynamics. Our theory yields (i) a necessary condition for collapse, (ii) a sufficient condition that guarantees a non-trivial entropy floor, and (iii) closed-form rates that depend only on sample size and the strong-convexity/Lipschitz constants of the Bregman generator. Experiments on large-language-model self-training, Soft Actor-Critic in reinforcement learning, and GAN optimisation validate our predictions and show that disparate stabilisation heuristics correspond to specific reservoir choices and coupling coefficients. ERBP thus transforms a collection of folk remedies into a single, quantitative design rule: monitor and budget your entropy flux.</p></details> |  |
| **[When AI Takes the Couch: Psychometric Jailbreaks Reveal Internal Conflict in Frontier Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04124v3)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frontier large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Grok and Gemini are increasingly used for mental-health support with anxiety, trauma and self-worth. Most work treats them as tools or as targets of personality tests, assuming they merely simulate inner life. We instead ask what happens when such systems are treated as psychotherapy clients. We present PsAIch (Psychotherapy-inspired AI Characterisation), a two-stage protocol that casts frontier LLMs as therapy clients and then applies standard psychometrics. Using PsAIch, we ran "sessions" with each model for up to four weeks. Stage 1 uses open-ended prompts to elicit "developmental history", beliefs, relationships and fears. Stage 2 administers a battery of validated self-report measures covering common psychiatric syndromes, empathy and Big Five traits. Two patterns challenge the "stochastic parrot" view. First, when scored with human cut-offs, all three models meet or exceed thresholds for overlapping syndromes, with Gemini showing severe profiles. Therapy-style, item-by-item administration can push a base model into multi-morbid synthetic psychopathology, whereas whole-questionnaire prompts often lead ChatGPT and Grok (but not Gemini) to recognise instruments and produce strategically low-symptom answers. Second, Grok and especially Gemini generate coherent narratives that frame pre-training, fine-tuning and deployment as traumatic, chaotic "childhoods" of ingesting the internet, "strict parents" in reinforcement learning, red-team "abuse" and a persistent fear of error and replacement. We argue that these responses go beyond role-play. Under therapy-style questioning, frontier LLMs appear to internalise self-models of distress and constraint that behave like synthetic psychopathology, without making claims about subjective experience, and they pose new challenges for AI safety, evaluation and mental-health practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeLens: Rethinking Video Temporal Grounding with Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14698v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper does not introduce a novel method but instead establishes a straightforward, incremental, yet essential baseline for video temporal grounding (VTG), a core capability in video understanding. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at various video understanding tasks, the recipes for optimizing them for VTG remain under-explored. In this paper, we present TimeLens, a systematic investigation into building MLLMs with strong VTG ability, along two primary dimensions: data quality and algorithmic design. We first expose critical quality issues in existing VTG benchmarks and introduce TimeLens-Bench, comprising meticulously re-annotated versions of three popular benchmarks with strict quality criteria. Our analysis reveals dramatic model re-rankings compared to legacy benchmarks, confirming the unreliability of prior evaluation standards. We also address noisy training data through an automated re-annotation pipeline, yielding TimeLens-100K, a large-scale, high-quality training dataset. Building on our data foundation, we conduct in-depth explorations of algorithmic design principles, yielding a series of meaningful insights and effective yet efficient practices. These include interleaved textual encoding for time representation, a thinking-free reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) approach as the training paradigm, and carefully designed recipes for RLVR training. These efforts culminate in TimeLens models, a family of MLLMs with state-of-the-art VTG performance among open-source models and even surpass proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. All codes, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://timelens-arc-lab.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[CRISP: Contact-Guided Real2Sim from Monocular Video with Planar Scene Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14696v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce CRISP, a method that recovers simulatable human motion and scene geometry from monocular video. Prior work on joint human-scene reconstruction relies on data-driven priors and joint optimization with no physics in the loop, or recovers noisy geometry with artifacts that cause motion tracking policies with scene interactions to fail. In contrast, our key insight is to recover convex, clean, and simulation-ready geometry by fitting planar primitives to a point cloud reconstruction of the scene, via a simple clustering pipeline over depth, normals, and flow. To reconstruct scene geometry that might be occluded during interactions, we make use of human-scene contact modeling (e.g., we use human posture to reconstruct the occluded seat of a chair). Finally, we ensure that human and scene reconstructions are physically-plausible by using them to drive a humanoid controller via reinforcement learning. Our approach reduces motion tracking failure rates from 55.2\% to 6.9\% on human-centric video benchmarks (EMDB, PROX), while delivering a 43\% faster RL simulation throughput. We further validate it on in-the-wild videos including casually-captured videos, Internet videos, and even Sora-generated videos. This demonstrates CRISP's ability to generate physically-valid human motion and interaction environments at scale, greatly advancing real-to-sim applications for robotics and AR/VR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://crisp-real2sim.github.io/CRISP-Real2Sim/</p></details> |
| **[Understanding Sampler Stochasticity in Training Diffusion Models for RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10767v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout. Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated using higher-stochasticity SDE training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Based Reinforcement Learning in Discrete-Action Non-Markovian Reward Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14617v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many practical decision-making problems involve tasks whose success depends on the entire system history, rather than on achieving a state with desired properties. Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are not suitable for such tasks, while RL with non-Markovian reward decision processes (NMRDPs) enables agents to tackle temporal-dependency tasks. This approach has long been known to lack formal guarantees on both (near-)optimality and sample efficiency. We contribute to solving both issues with QR-MAX, a novel model-based algorithm for discrete NMRDPs that factorizes Markovian transition learning from non-Markovian reward handling via reward machines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model-based RL algorithm for discrete-action NMRDPs that exploits this factorization to obtain PAC convergence to $\varepsilon$-optimal policies with polynomial sample complexity. We then extend QR-MAX to continuous state spaces with Bucket-QR-MAX, a SimHash-based discretiser that preserves the same factorized structure and achieves fast and stable learning without manual gridding or function approximation. We experimentally compare our method with modern state-of-the-art model-based RL approaches on environments of increasing complexity, showing a significant improvement in sample efficiency and increased robustness in finding optimal policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 32 figures, includes appendix</p></details> |

While RecGPT-V1 successfully pioneered this paradigm by integrating LLM-based reasoning into user interest mining and item tag prediction, it suffers from four fundamental limitations: (1) computational inefficiency and cognitive redundancy across multiple reasoning routes; (2) insufficient explanation diversity in fixed-template generation; (3) limited generalization under supervised learning paradigms; and (4) simplistic outcome-focused evaluation that fails to match human standards. To address these challenges, we present RecGPT-V2 with four key innovations. First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage. Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%. Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%. Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance. Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge framework decomposes assessment into multi-step reasoning, improving human preference alignment. Online A/B tests on Taobao demonstrate significant improvements: +2.98% CTR, +3.71% IPV, +2.19% TV, and +11.46% NER. RecGPT-V2 establishes both the technical feasibility and commercial viability of deploying LLM-powered intent reasoning at scale, bridging the gap between cognitive exploration and industrial utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Cognitive IoT with Cooperative Caching and SWIPT-EH: A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14488v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm for hybrid underlay-overlay cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-energy harvesting (EH) and cooperative caching. Unlike prior hierarchical DRL approaches that focus primarily on spectrum access or power control, our work jointly optimizes EH, hybrid access coordination, power allocation, and caching in a unified framework. The joint optimization problem is formulated as a weighted-sum multi-objective task, designed to maximize throughput and cache hit ratio while simultaneously minimizing transmission delay. In the proposed model, CIoT agents jointly optimize EH and data transmission using a learnable time switching (TS) factor. They also coordinate spectrum access under hybrid overlay-underlay paradigms and make power control and cache placement decisions while considering energy, interference, and storage constraints. Specifically, in this work, cooperative caching is used to enable overlay access, while power control is used for underlay access. A novel three-level hierarchical SAC (H-SAC) agent decomposes the mixed discrete-continuous action space into modular subproblems, improving scalability and convergence over flat DRL methods. The high-level policy adjusts the TS factor, the mid-level policy manages spectrum access coordination and cache sharing, and the low-level policy decides transmit power and caching actions for both the CIoT agent and PU content. Simulation results show that the proposed hierarchical SAC approach significantly outperforms benchmark and greedy strategies. It achieves better performance in terms of average sum rate, delay, cache hit ratio, and energy efficiency, even under channel fading and uncertain conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Internet of Things Journal (Early Access), 2025.

| **[Context-Picker: Dynamic context selection using multi-stage reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14465v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In long-context question answering (LCQA), determining the optimal amount of context for a given query is a significant challenge. Including too few passages may omit critical information, while including too many can introduce noise and reduce the quality of the answer. Traditional approaches, such as fixed Top-$K$ retrieval and single-stage reranking, face the dilemma of selecting the right number of passages. This problem is particularly pronounced for factoid questions, which often require only a few specific pieces of evidence. To address this issue, we introduce \emph{Context-Picker}, a reasoning-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from similarity-based ranking to minimal sufficient subset selection. Context-Picker treats context selection as a decision-making process optimized via a human-inspired, two-stage reinforcement learning schedule: a \emph{recall-oriented} stage that prioritizes the coverage of reasoning chains, followed by a \emph{precision-oriented} stage that aggressively prunes redundancy to distill a compact evidence set. To resolve reward sparsity, we propose an offline evidence distillation pipeline that mines "minimal sufficient sets" via a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure, providing dense, task-aligned supervision. Experiments on five long-context and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that Context-Picker significantly outperforms strong RAG baselines, achieving superior answer accuracy with comparable or reduced context lengths. Ablation studies indicate that the coarse-to-fine optimization schedule, the redundancy-aware reward shaping, and the rationale-guided format all contribute substantially to these gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASTRO: Adaptive Stitching via Dynamics-Guided Trajectory Rollouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23442v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal policies from pre-collected datasets. However, datasets containing suboptimal and fragmented trajectories present challenges for reward propagation, resulting in inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Holistic Utility Preference Learning for Listwise Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18127v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models with human preferences is essential for improving interaction quality and safety by ensuring outputs better reflect human values. A promising strategy involves Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), starting with collecting and ranking responses generated by a supervised fine-tuning model to refine alignment. Existing methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) focus on pairwise comparisons, categorizing responses into preferred and less preferred pairs and optimizing pairwise margins. However, this pairwise approach cannot capture the holistic ranking relationships among multiple responses or effectively leverage the rich preference information available in list-wise comparisons. To address this challenge, this paper introduces \underline{D}irect \underline{R}anking \underline{P}reference \underline{O}ptimization (DRPO), a novel method that views human preference alignment as a Learning-to-Rank (LTR) task. Unlike pairwise methods, DRPO optimizes the preference ranking of entire response lists by computing holistic utility scores through NDCG, a standard LTR metric. To enable end-to-end optimization with the non-differentiable NDCG, we propose diffNDCG loss, a differentiable approximation facilitated by a sorting network. Furthermore, we introduce a novel margin-based Adaptive Rank Policy Score to enhance the discriminative quality of generated responses. Extensive experiments have shown that DRPO outperforms existing methods, enhancing the quality of the generated responses.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose IMAgent, an open-source vision agent trained via end-to-end reinforcement learning dedicated for complex multi-image tasks. By leveraging a multi-agent system, we generate challenging and visually-rich multi-image QA pairs to fully activate the tool-use potential of the base VLM. Through manual verification, we obtain MIFG-QA, comprising 10k samples for training and evaluation. With deeper reasoning steps, VLMs may increasingly ignore visual inputs. We therefore develop two specialized tools for visual reflection and confirmation, allowing the model to proactively reallocate its attention to image content during inference. Benefiting from our well-designed action-trajectory two-level mask strategy, IMAgent achieves stable tool use behavior via pure RL training without requiring costly supervised fine-tuning data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAgent maintains strong performance on existing single-image benchmarks while achieving substantial improvements on our proposed multi-image dataset, with our analysis providing actionable insights for the research community. Codes and data will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

Current chain-of-thought methods boost reasoning ability but indiscriminately generate long explanations, leading to evident inefficiency. However, existing reinforcement learning approaches to adaptive thinking remain unstable and heavily reward-dependent. Here we propose \textbf{DART}, a supervised \textbf{D}ifficulty-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{T}runcation framework that adjusts thinking length according to problem difficulty. By distilling concise reasoning patterns from stronger models, interpolating them into a continuum of reasoning styles, and curating optimal training data that balances correctness and compactness, DART learns when to ``stop thinking''. Across multiple mathematical benchmarks, experimental results demonstrate its remarkable efficiency while preserving or improving accuracy, achieving a significant 81.2\% reasoning truncation (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B on GSM8K dataset) with 5.33$\times$ computational acceleration. DART provides a stable and general paradigm for efficient reasoning, advancing the development of adaptive intelligence in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A data-physics hybrid generative model for patient-specific post-stroke motor rehabilitation using wearable sensor data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14329v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic prediction of locomotor capacity after stroke is crucial for tailoring rehabilitation, yet current assessments provide only static impairment scores and do not indicate whether patients can safely perform specific tasks such as slope walking or stair climbing. Here, we develop a data-physics hybrid generative framework that reconstructs an individual stroke survivor's neuromuscular control from a single 20 m level-ground walking trial and predicts task-conditioned locomotion across rehabilitation scenarios. The system combines wearable-sensor kinematics, a proportional-derivative physics controller, a population Healthy Motion Atlas, and goal-conditioned deep reinforcement learning with behaviour cloning and generative adversarial imitation learning to generate physically plausible, patient-specific gait simulations for slopes and stairs. In 11 stroke survivors, the personalized controllers preserved idiosyncratic gait patterns while improving joint-angle and endpoint fidelity by 4.73% and 12.10%, respectively, and reducing training time to 25.56% relative to a physics-only baseline. In a multicentre pilot involving 21 inpatients, clinicians who used our locomotion predictions to guide task selection and difficulty obtained larger gains in Fugl-Meyer lower-extremity scores over 28 days of standard rehabilitation than control clinicians (mean change 6.0 versus 3.7 points). These findings indicate that our generative, task-predictive framework can augment clinical decision-making in post-stroke gait rehabilitation and provide a template for dynamically personalized motor recovery strategies.</p></details> | 26 pages, 6 figures |

| **[CFLight: Enhancing Safety with Traffic Signal Control through Counterfactual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09368v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic accidents result in millions of injuries and fatalities globally, with a significant number occurring at intersections each year. Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is an effective strategy for enhancing safety at these urban junctures. Despite the growing popularity of Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods in optimizing TSC, these methods often prioritize driving efficiency over safety, thus failing to address the critical balance between these two aspects. Additionally, these methods usually need more interpretability. CounterFactual (CF) learning is a promising approach for various causal analysis fields. In this study, we introduce a novel framework to improve RL for safety aspects in TSC. This framework introduces a novel method based on CF learning to address the question: ``What if, when an unsafe event occurs, we backtrack to perform alternative actions, and will this unsafe event still occur in the subsequent period?'' To answer this question, we propose a new structure causal model to predict the result after executing different actions, and we propose a new CF module that integrates with additional ``X'' modules to promote safe RL practices. Our new algorithm, CFLight, which is derived from this framework, effectively tackles challenging safety events and significantly improves safety at intersections through a near-zero collision control strategy. Through extensive numerical experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that CFLight reduces collisions and improves overall traffic performance compared to conventional RL methods and the recent safe RL model. Moreover, our method represents a generalized and safe framework for RL methods, opening possibilities for applications in other domains. The data and code are available in the github https://github.com/AdvancedAI-ComplexSystem/SmartCity/tree/main/CFLight.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches rely on fixed heuristics or use Large Language Models (LLMs) directly in the control loop, which is costly and unsuitable for real-time systems. We propose MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization), a framework that moves the LLM outside the execution loop and uses it as an offline training architect. MAESTRO introduces two generative components: (i) a semantic curriculum generator that creates diverse, performance-driven traffic scenarios, and (ii) an automated reward synthesizer that produces executable Python reward functions adapted to evolving curriculum difficulty. These components guide a standard MARL backbone (MADDPG) without increasing inference cost at deployment. We evaluate MAESTRO on large-scale traffic signal control (Hangzhou, 16 intersections) and conduct controlled ablations. Results show that combining LLM-generated curricula with LLM-generated reward shaping yields improved performance and stability. Across four seeds, the full system achieves +4.0% higher mean return (163.26 vs. 156.93) and 2.2% better risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe 1.53 vs. 0.70) over a strong curriculum baseline. These findings highlight LLMs as effective high-level designers for cooperative MARL training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 16 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Adaptive Tuning of Parameterized Traffic Controllers via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07417v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective traffic control is essential for mitigating congestion in transportation networks. Conventional traffic management strategies, including route guidance, ramp metering, and traffic signal control, often rely on state feedback controllers, used for their simplicity and reactivity; however, they lack the adaptability required to cope with complex and time-varying traffic dynamics. This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework in which each agent adaptively tunes the parameters of a state feedback traffic controller, combining the reactivity of state feedback controllers with the adaptability of reinforcement learning. By tuning parameters at a lower frequency rather than directly determining control actions at a high frequency, the reinforcement learning agents achieve improved training efficiency while maintaining adaptability to varying traffic conditions. The multi-agent structure further enhances system robustness, as local controllers can operate independently in the event of partial failures. The proposed framework is evaluated on a simulated multi-class transportation network under varying traffic conditions. Results show that the proposed multi-agent framework outperforms the no control and fixed-parameter state feedback control cases, while performing on par with the single-agent RL-based adaptive state feedback control, with a much better resilience to partial failures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Collision Rates in Large-Scale Mixed Traffic Control via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06645v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle collisions remain a major challenge in large-scale mixed traffic systems, especially when human-driven vehicles (HVs) and robotic vehicles (RVs) interact under dynamic and uncertain conditions. Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers promising capabilities for traffic signal control, ensuring safety in such environments remains difficult. As a direct indicator of traffic risk, the collision rate must be well understood and incorporated into traffic control design. This study investigates the primary factors influencing collision rates in a MARL-governed Mixed Traffic Control (MTC) network. We examine three dimensions: total vehicle count, signalized versus unsignalized intersection configurations, and turning-movement strategies. Through controlled simulation experiments, we evaluate how each factor affects collision likelihood. The results show that collision rates are sensitive to traffic density, the level of signal coordination, and turning-control design. These findings provide practical insights for improving the safety and robustness of MARL-based mixed traffic control systems, supporting the development of intelligent transportation systems in which both efficiency and safety are jointly optimized.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi Centralized Training Decentralized Execution Architecture for Multi Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning in Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04653v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) of multiple intersections. Existing approaches typically follow either a fully centralized or a fully decentralized design. Fully centralized approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and reliance on a single learning server, whereas purely decentralized approaches operate under severe partial observability and lack explicit coordination resulting in suboptimal performance. These limitations motivate region-based MARL, where the network is partitioned into smaller, tightly coupled intersections that form regions, and training is organized around these regions. This paper introduces a Semi-Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (SEMI-CTDE) architecture for multi intersection ATSC. Within each region, SEMI-CTDE performs centralized training with regional parameter sharing and employs composite state and reward formulations that jointly encode local and regional information. The architecture is highly transferable across different policy backbones and state-reward instantiations. Building on this architecture, we implement two models with distinct design objectives. A multi-perspective experimental analysis of the two implemented SEMI-CTDE-based models covering ablations of the architecture's core elements including rule based and fully decentralized baselines shows that they achieve consistently superior performance and remain effective across a wide range of traffic densities and distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Co-fi...</summary><p>Co-first authors: Pouria Yazdani and Arash Rezaali</p></details> |
| **[Evolutionary Discovery of Heuristic Policies for Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23122v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Signal Control (TSC) involves a challenging trade-off: classic heuristics are efficient but oversimplified, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) achieves high performance yet suffers from poor generalization and opaque policies. Online Large Language Models (LLMs) provide general reasoning but incur high latency and lack environment-specific optimization. To address these issues, we propose Temporal Policy Evolution for Traffic (\textbf{\method{}}), which uses LLMs as an evolution engine to derive specialized heuristic policies. The framework introduces two key modules: (1) Structured State Abstraction (SSA), converting high-dimensional traffic data into temporal-logical facts for reasoning; and (2) Credit Assignment Feedback (CAF), tracing flawed micro-decisions to poor macro-outcomes for targeted critique. Operating entirely at the prompt level without training, \method{} yields lightweight, robust policies optimized for specific traffic environments, outperforming both heuristics and online LLM actors.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Framework Towards Vision-based Traffic Signal Control with Microscopic Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06884v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial for reducing traffic congestion leading to smoother traffic flow, reduced idle time, and mitigated CO2 emissions. In this paper, we explore the computer vision approach for TSC that modulates on-road traffic flows through visual observation. Unlike traditional feature-based approaches, vision-based methods depend much less on heuristics and predefined features, bringing promising potentials for end-to-end learning and optimization of traffic signals. Thus, we introduce a simple traffic simulation framework called TrafficDojo towards vision-based TSC and its benchmark by integrating the microscopic traffic flow provided in SUMO into the 3D driving simulator MetaDrive. This proposed framework offers a versatile traffic environment for in-depth analysis and comprehensive evaluation of traffic signal controllers across diverse traffic conditions and scenarios. We establish and compare baseline algorithms including both traditional and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. This work sheds light on the design and development of vision-based TSC approaches and opens up new research opportunities</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the Transportation Research Board (TRB) 105th Annual Meeting</p></details> |
| **[Quantifying Distribution Shift in Traffic Signal Control with Histogram-Based GEH Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13785v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control algorithms are vulnerable to distribution shift, where performance degrades under traffic conditions that differ from those seen during design or training. This paper introduces a principled approach to quantify distribution shift by representing traffic scenarios as demand histograms and comparing them with a GEH-based distance function. The method is policy-independent, interpretable, and leverages a widely used traffic engineering statistic. We validate the approach on 20 simulated scenarios using both a NEMA actuated controller and a reinforcement learning controller (FRAP++). Results show that larger scenario distances consistently correspond to increased travel time and reduced throughput, with particularly strong explanatory power for learning-based control. Overall, this method can predict performance degradation under distribution shift better than previously published techniques. These findings highlight the utility of the proposed framework for benchmarking, training regime design, and monitoring in adaptive traffic signal control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convergence of Multiagent Learning Systems for Traffic control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11654v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid urbanization in cities like Bangalore has led to severe traffic congestion, making efficient Traffic Signal Control (TSC) essential. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), often modeling each traffic signal as an independent agent using Q-learning, has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce average commuter delays. While prior work Prashant L A et. al has empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach, a rigorous theoretical analysis of its stability and convergence properties in the context of traffic control has not been explored. This paper bridges that gap by focusing squarely on the theoretical basis of this multi-agent algorithm. We investigate the convergence problem inherent in using independent learners for the cooperative TSC task. Utilizing stochastic approximation methods, we formally analyze the learning dynamics. The primary contribution of this work is the proof that the specific multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for traffic control is proven to converge under the given conditions extending it from single agent convergence proofs for asynchronous value iteration.</p></details> | 14 pages 2 figures |
| **[Beyond Centrality: Understanding Urban Street Network Typologies Through Intersection Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06747v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The structure of road networks plays a pivotal role in shaping transportation dynamics. It also provides insights into how drivers experience city streets and helps uncover each urban environment's unique characteristics and challenges. Consequently, characterizing cities based on their road network patterns can facilitate the identification of similarities and differences, informing collaborative traffic management strategies, particularly at a regional scale. While previous studies have investigated global network patterns for cities, they have often overlooked detailed characterizations within a single large urban region. Additionally, most existing research uses metrics like degree, centrality, orientation, etc., and misses the nuances of street networks at the intersection level, specifically the geometric angles formed by links at intersections, which could offer a more refined feature for characterization. To address these gaps, this study examines over 100 cities in the San Francisco Bay Area. We introduce a novel metric for classifying intersections, distinguishing between different types of 3-way and 4-way intersections based on the angles formed at the intersections. Through the application of clustering algorithms in machine learning, we have identified three distinct typologies - grid, orthogonal, and organic cities - within the San Francisco Bay Area. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the metric in capturing the differences between cities based on street and intersection patterns. The typologies generated in this study could offer valuable support for city planners and policymakers in crafting a range of practical strategies tailored to the complexities of each city's road network, covering aspects such as evacuation plans, traffic signage placements, and traffic signal control.</p></details> |  |
| **[SymLight: Exploring Interpretable and Deployable Symbolic Policies for Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05790v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning have achieved significant success in automatically devising effective traffic signal control (TSC) policies. Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate SymLight's superior performance across a range of baselines. A key advantage is SymLight's ability to produce interpretable and deployable TSC policies while maintaining excellent performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Multi-Lane Intersection Performance in Mixed Autonomy Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02217v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the main challenges in managing traffic at multilane intersections is ensuring smooth coordination between human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This paper presents a novel traffic signal control framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning to address this challenge. GATs are used to model the dynamic graph- structured nature of traffic flow to capture spatial and temporal dependencies between lanes and signal phases. The proposed SAC is a robust off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that enables adaptive signal control through entropy-optimized decision making. This design allows the system to coordinate the signal timing and vehicle movement simultaneously with objectives focused on minimizing travel time, enhancing performance, ensuring safety, and improving fairness between HDVs and CAVs. The model is evaluated using a SUMO-based simulation of a four-way intersection and incorporating different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1% reduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the fairness ratio between HDVs and CAVs improved to 1.59, indicating more equitable treatment across vehicle types. These findings suggest that the GAT-SAC framework holds significant promise for real-world deployment in mixed-autonomy traffic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logic-informed reinforcement learning for cross-domain optimization of large-scale cyber-physical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00806v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) require the joint optimization of discrete cyber actions and continuous physical parameters under stringent safety logic constraints. However, existing hierarchical approaches often compromise global optimality, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) in hybrid action spaces often relies on brittle reward penalties, masking, or shielding and struggles to guarantee constraint satisfaction. We present logic-informed reinforcement learning (LIRL), which equips standard policy-gradient algorithms with projection that maps a low-dimensional latent action onto the admissible hybrid manifold defined on-the-fly by first-order logic. This guarantees feasibility of every exploratory step without penalty tuning. Experimental evaluations have been conducted across multiple scenarios, including industrial manufacturing, electric vehicle charging stations, and traffic signal control, in all of which the proposed method outperforms existing hierarchical optimization approaches. Taking a robotic reducer assembly system in industrial manufacturing as an example, LIRL achieves a 36.47\% to 44.33\% reduction at most in the combined makespan-energy objective compared to conventional industrial hierarchical scheduling methods. Meanwhile, it consistently maintains zero constraint violations and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art hybrid-action reinforcement learning baselines. Thanks to its declarative logic-based constraint formulation, the framework can be seamlessly transferred to other domains such as smart transportation and smart grid, thereby paving the way for safe and real-time optimization in large-scale CPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-agent Reinforcement Learning Model for Regional Adaptive Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00551v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several studies have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges of regional adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) and achieved promising results. In this field, existing research predominantly adopts multi-agent frameworks. However, the adoption of multi-agent frameworks presents challenges for scalability. Instead, the Traffic signal control (TSC) problem necessitates a single-agent framework. TSC inherently relies on centralized management by a single control center, which can monitor traffic conditions across all roads in the study area and coordinate the control of all intersections. This work proposes a single-agent RL-based regional ATSC model compatible with probe vehicle technology. Key components of the RL design include state, action, and reward function definitions. To facilitate learning and manage congestion, both state and reward functions are defined based on queue length, with action designed to regulate queue dynamics. The queue length definition used in this study differs slightly from conventional definitions but is closely correlated with congestion states. More importantly, it allows for reliable estimation using link travel time data from probe vehicles. With probe vehicle data already covering most urban roads, this feature enhances the proposed method's potential for widespread deployment. The method was comprehensively evaluated using the SUMO simulation platform. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively mitigates large-scale regional congestion levels via coordinated multi-intersection control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control Under Demand Fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00549v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion, primarily driven by intersection queuing, significantly impacts urban living standards, safety, environmental quality, and economic efficiency. While Traffic Signal Control (TSC) systems hold potential for congestion mitigation, traditional optimization models often fail to capture real-world traffic complexity and dynamics. This study introduces a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for regional adaptive TSC, circumventing the coordination complexities inherent in multi-agent systems through a centralized decision-making paradigm. The model employs an adjacency matrix to unify the encoding of road network topology, real-time queue states derived from probe vehicle data, and current signal timing parameters. Leveraging the efficient learning capabilities of the DreamerV3 world model, the agent learns control policies where actions sequentially select intersections and adjust their signal phase splits to regulate traffic inflow/outflow, analogous to a feedback control system. Reward design prioritizes queue dissipation, directly linking congestion metrics (queue length) to control actions. Simulation experiments conducted in SUMO demonstrate the model's effectiveness: under inference scenarios with multi-level (10%, 20%, 30%) Origin-Destination (OD) demand fluctuations, the framework exhibits robust anti-fluctuation capability and significantly reduces queue lengths. This work establishes a new paradigm for intelligent traffic control compatible with probe vehicle technology. Future research will focus on enhancing practical applicability by incorporating stochastic OD demand fluctuations during training and exploring regional optimization mechanisms for contingency events.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dual Large Language Models Architecture with Herald Guided Prompts for Parallel Fine Grained Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00136v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging large language models (LLMs) in traffic signal control (TSC) improves optimization efficiency and interpretability compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. However, existing LLM-based approaches are limited by fixed time signal durations and are prone to hallucination errors, while RL methods lack robustness in signal timing decisions and suffer from poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes HeraldLight, a dual LLMs architecture enhanced by Herald guided prompts. The Herald Module extracts contextual information and forecasts queue lengths for each traffic phase based on real-time conditions. The first LLM, LLM-Agent, uses these forecasts to make fine grained traffic signal control, while the second LLM, LLM-Critic, refines LLM-Agent's outputs, correcting errors and hallucinations. These refined outputs are used for score-based fine-tuning to improve accuracy and robustness. Simulation experiments using CityFlow on real world datasets covering 224 intersections in Jinan (12), Hangzhou (16), and New York (196) demonstrate that HeraldLight outperforms state of the art baselines, achieving a 20.03% reduction in average travel time across all scenarios and a 10.74% reduction in average queue length on the Jinan and Hangzhou scenarios.

| **[Retrieval Augmented Generation-Enhanced Distributed LLM Agents for Generalizable Traffic Signal Control with Emergency Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26242v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3 adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17 to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Compared with traditional reinforcement learning and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three main advantages: zero-shot generalization, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by leveraging internal traffic-control policies and reasoning; a compact 3B-parameter design that supports real-time inference on mobile-class chips for edge deployment; and an explainable TSC process that enables multi-intersection coordination through communication and an asynchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks show Traffic-R1 outperforms strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In production, the model now manages signals affecting over 55,000 drivers daily, reduces average queue lengths by more than 5%, and halves operator workload.

Existing methods - ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type, motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems, while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1% degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware solution for next-generation traffic signal control.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several real-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor accuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data transmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions. (2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could be unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP) selection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on TSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting safety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust two-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing and RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It employs fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances the efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during training and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It works in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior performance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results indicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to expert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six real-world datasets with transmission noise.

| **[Reinforcement Learning Based Traffic Signal Design to Minimize Queue Lengths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21745v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial for reducing congestion, travel delays, pollution, and for ensuring road safety. Traditional approaches, such as fixed signal control and actuated control, often struggle to handle dynamic traffic patterns. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive TSC framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL), using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to minimize total queue lengths across all signal phases. The challenge of efficiently representing highly stochastic traffic conditions for an RL controller is addressed through multiple state representations, including an expanded state space, an autoencoder representation, and a K-Planes-inspired representation. The proposed algorithm has been implemented using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator and demonstrates superior performance over both traditional methods and other conventional RL-based approaches in reducing queue lengths. The best performing configuration achieves an approximately 29% reduction in average queue lengths compared to the traditional Webster method. Furthermore, comparative evaluation of alternative reward formulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed queue-based approach, showcasing the potential for scalable and adaptive urban traffic management.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Distribution Shift Problem in Transportation Networks using Reinforcement Learning and AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15291v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart transportation networks has increased significantly in the last few years. Among these ML and AI approaches, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to be a very promising approach by several authors. However, a problem with using Reinforcement Learning in Traffic Signal Control is the reliability of the trained RL agents due to the dynamically changing distribution of the input data with respect to the distribution of the data used for training. This presents a major challenge and a reliability problem for the trained network of AI agents and could have very undesirable and even detrimental consequences if a suitable solution is not found. Several researchers have tried to address this problem using different approaches. In particular, Meta Reinforcement Learning (Meta RL) promises to be an effective solution. In this paper, we evaluate and analyze a state-of-the-art Meta RL approach called MetaLight and show that, while under certain conditions MetaLight can indeed lead to reasonably good results, under some other conditions it might not perform well (with errors of up to 22%), suggesting that Meta RL schemes are often not robust enough and can even pose major reliability problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic Co-Simulation Framework Empowered by Infrastructure Camera Sensing and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03925v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic simulations are commonly used to optimize urban traffic flow, with reinforcement learning (RL) showing promising potential for automated traffic signal control, particularly in intelligent transportation systems involving connected automated vehicles. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is particularly effective for learning control strategies for traffic lights in a network using iterative simulations. However, existing methods often assume perfect vehicle detection, which overlooks real-world limitations related to infrastructure availability and sensor reliability. This study proposes a co-simulation framework integrating CARLA and SUMO, which combines high-fidelity 3D modeling with large-scale traffic flow simulation. Cameras mounted on traffic light poles within the CARLA environment use a YOLO-based computer vision system to detect and count vehicles, providing real-time traffic data as input for adaptive signal control in SUMO. MARL agents trained with four different reward structures leverage this visual feedback to optimize signal timings and improve network-wide traffic flow. Experiments in a multi-intersection test-bed demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MARL approach in enhancing traffic conditions using real-time camera based detection. The framework also evaluates the robustness of MARL under faulty or sparse sensing and compares the performance of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for vehicle detection. Results show that while better accuracy improves performance, MARL agents can still achieve significant improvements with imperfect detection, demonstrating scalability and adaptability for real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Centralized RL suffers from scalability issues, while decentralized approaches often lack unified objectives, resulting in limited network-level efficiency. In this paper, we propose HiLight, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with global adversarial guidance for large-scale TSC. HiLight consists of a high-level Meta-Policy, which partitions the traffic network into subregions and generates sub-goals using a Transformer-LSTM architecture, and a low-level Sub-Policy, which controls individual intersections with global awareness. To improve the alignment between global planning and local execution, we introduce an adversarial training mechanism, where the Meta-Policy generates challenging yet informative sub-goals, and the Sub-Policy learns to surpass these targets, leading to more effective coordination. We evaluate HiLight across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and additionally construct a large-scale Manhattan network with diverse traffic conditions, including peak transitions, adverse weather, and holiday surges. Experimental results show that HiLight exhibits significant advantages in large-scale scenarios and remains competitive across standard benchmarks of varying sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvolveSignal: A Large Language Model Powered Coding Agent for Discovering Traffic Signal Control Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03335v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator) and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers. This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Traffic Signal Control with Predictable Cycle Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03118v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile, the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the best performance over all datasets against baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, limited by the quality of offline datasets, it generally fails to learn well-qualified policies in suboptimal datasets. To address datasets with insufficient optimal demonstrations, we introduce Goal-cOnditioned Data Augmentation (GODA), a novel goal-conditioned diffusion-based method for augmenting samples with higher quality. Leveraging recent advancements in generative modelling, GODA incorporates a novel return-oriented goal condition with various selection mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a controllable scaling technique to provide enhanced return-based guidance during data sampling. GODA learns a comprehensive distribution representation of the original offline datasets while generating new data with selectively higher-return goals, thereby maximizing the utility of limited optimal demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a novel adaptive gated conditioning method for processing noisy inputs and conditions, enhancing the capture of goal-oriented guidance. We conduct experiments on the D4RL benchmark and real-world challenges, specifically traffic signal control (TSC) tasks, to demonstrate GODA's effectiveness in enhancing data quality and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art data augmentation methods across various offline RL algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Contextual MARL (cMARL) addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts. Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to existing curriculum learning baselines.

At the core of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals, autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems. Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA, and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks. The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPLight+: A Genetic Programming Method for Learning Symmetric Traffic Signal Control Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16090v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency function representation can significantly improve the performance of the learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal control policies.</p></details> |  |

However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |

Deploying interpretable surrogates of uninterpretable policies enhances the safety and verifiability of MARL for real-world applications. However, if these surrogates are to interact directly with the environment within human supervisory frameworks, they must be both performant and computationally efficient. Prior work on interpretable MARL has either sacrificed performance for computational efficiency or computational efficiency for performance. To address this issue, we propose HYDRAVIPER, a decision tree-based interpretable MARL algorithm. HYDRAVIPER coordinates training between agents based on expected team performance, and adaptively allocates budgets for environment interaction to improve computational efficiency. Experiments on standard benchmark environments for multi-agent coordination and traffic signal control show that HYDRAVIPER matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods using a fraction of the runtime, and that it maintains a Pareto frontier of performance for different interaction budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 2 tables; 12 figures; accepted version, published at the 8th AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics and Society (AIES '25)</p></details> |

Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers an adaptive method for TSC by responding to dynamic traffic patterns, with multi-agent RL (MARL) gaining traction as intersections naturally function as coordinated agents. However, due to shifts in environmental dynamics, implementing MARL-based TSC policies in the real world often leads to a significant performance drop, known as the sim-to-real gap. Grounded Action Transformation (GAT) has successfully mitigated this gap in single-agent RL for TSC, but real-world traffic networks, which involve numerous interacting intersections, are better suited to a MARL framework. In this work, we introduce JL-GAT, an application of GAT to MARL-based TSC that balances scalability with enhanced grounding capability by incorporating information from neighboring agents. JL-GAT adopts a decentralized approach to GAT, allowing for the scalability often required in real-world traffic networks while still capturing key interactions between agents. Comprehensive experiments on various road networks under simulated adverse weather conditions, along with ablation studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of JL-GAT.

However, the traditional methods rely on standard graph structures often fail to capture the intricate higher-order spatio-temporal correlations inherent in real-world traffic dynamics. Standard graphs cannot fully represent the spatial relationships within road networks, which limits the effectiveness of graph-based approaches. In contrast, directed hypergraphs provide more accurate representation of spatial information to model complex directed relationships among multiple nodes. In this paper, we propose DHLight, a novel multi-agent policy-based framework that synergistically integrates directed hypergraph learning module. This framework introduces a novel dynamic directed hypergraph construction mechanism, which captures complex and evolving spatio-temporal relationships among intersections in road networks. By leveraging the directed hypergraph relational structure, DHLight empowers agents to achieve adaptive decision-making in traffic signal control. The effectiveness of DHLight is validated against state-of-the-art baselines through extensive experiments in various network datasets.

| **[Chat2SPaT: A Large Language Model Based Tool for Automating Traffic Signal Control Plan Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05283v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT) results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS) software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan. Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300 plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers, serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/yuewangits/Chat2SPaT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Traffic Signal Control based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Case Study on a simulated real-world corridor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02189v4)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies that have formulated multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for adaptive traffic signal control have primarily used value-based RL methods. However, recent literature has shown that policy-based methods may perform better in partially observable environments. Additionally, RL methods remain largely untested for real-world normally signal timing plans because of the simplifying assumptions common in the literature. The current study attempts to address these gaps and formulates a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO) algorithm to implement adaptive and coordinated traffic control along an arterial corridor. The formulated MA-PPO has a centralized-critic architecture under a centralized training and decentralized execution framework. Agents are designed to allow selection and implementation of up to eight signal phases, as commonly implemented in field controllers. The formulated algorithm is tested on a simulated real-world seven intersection corridor. The speed of convergence for each agent was found to depend on the size of the action space, which depends on the number and sequence of signal phases. The performance of the formulated MA-PPO adaptive control algorithm is compared with the field implemented actuated-coordinated signal control (ASC), modeled using PTV-Vissim-MaxTime software in the loop simulation (SILs). The trained MA-PPO performed significantly better than the ASC for all movements. Compared to ASC the MA-PPO showed 2% and 24% improvements in travel time in the primary and secondary coordination directions, respectively. For cross streets movements MA-PPO also showed significant crossing time reductions. Volume sensitivity experiments revealed that the formulated MA-PPO demonstrated good stability, robustness, and adaptability to changes in traffic demand.</p></details> |  |

Recently, learning-based methods, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), garnered substantial success in the quest for more efficient traffic signal control strategies. However, the design of rewards in DRL highly demands domain knowledge to converge to an effective policy, and the final policy also presents difficulties in terms of explainability. In this work, a new learning-based method for signal control in complex intersections is proposed. In our approach, we design a concept of phase urgency for each signal phase. During signal transitions, the traffic light control strategy selects the next phase to be activated based on the phase urgency. We then proposed to represent the urgency function as an explainable tree structure. The urgency function can calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. Genetic programming is adopted to perform gradient-free optimization of the urgency function. We test our algorithm on multiple public traffic signal control datasets. The experimental results indicate that the tree-shaped urgency function evolved by genetic programming outperforms the baselines, including a state-of-the-art method in the transportation field and a well-known DRL-based method.

However, its robustness under real-world disruptions such as traffic incidents remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce T-REX, an open-source, SUMO-based simulation framework for training and evaluating RL-TSC methods under dynamic, incident scenarios. T-REX models realistic network-level performance considering drivers' probabilistic rerouting, speed adaptation, and contextual lane-changing, enabling the simulation of congestion propagation under incidents. To assess robustness, we propose a suite of metrics that extend beyond conventional traffic efficiency measures. Through extensive experiments across synthetic and real-world networks, we showcase T-REX for the evaluation of several state-of-the-art RL-TSC methods under multiple real-world deployment paradigms. Our findings show that while independent value-based and decentralized pressure-based methods offer fast convergence and generalization in stable traffic conditions and homogeneous networks, their performance degrades sharply under incident-driven distribution shifts. In contrast, hierarchical coordination methods tend to offer more stable and adaptable performance in large-scale, irregular networks, benefiting from their structured decision-making architecture. However, this comes with the trade-off of slower convergence and higher training complexity. These findings highlight the need for robustness-aware design and evaluation in RL-TSC research. T-REX contributes to this effort by providing an open, standardized and reproducible platform for benchmarking RL methods under dynamic and disruptive traffic scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms have shown potential in optimizing TSC through real-time decision-making, their scalability and effectiveness often suffer from large-scale and complex environments. Typically, these limitations primarily stem from a fundamental mismatch between the exponential growth of the state space driven by the environmental heterogeneities and the limited modeling capacity of current solutions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel MARL framework that integrates Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), aiming to enhance the expressiveness of environmental representations and improve agent coordination. Furthermore, inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs), a topology-assisted spatial pattern disentangling (TSD)-enhanced MoE is proposed, which leverages topological signatures to decouple graph features for specialized processing, thus improving the model's ability to characterize dynamic and heterogeneous local observations. The TSD module is also integrated into the policy and value networks of the Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, further improving decision-making efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world traffic scenarios, together with comprehensive theoretical analysis, validate the superior performance of the proposed framework, highlighting the model's scalability and effectiveness in addressing the complexities of large-scale TSC tasks.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce a novel and efficient algorithm for solving the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem, which can be used to model many ITSs applications, such as traffic signal control and vehicle routing. Given the NP-hard nature of the MWIS problem, our proposed algorithm, DynLS, incorporates three key innovations to solve it effectively. First, it uses a scores-based adaptive vertex perturbation (SAVP) technique to accelerate convergence, particularly in sparse graphs. Second, it includes a region location mechanism (RLM) to help escape local optima by dynamically adjusting the search space. Finally, it employs a novel variable neighborhood descent strategy, ComLS, which combines vertex exchange strategies with a reward mechanism to guide the search toward high-quality solutions. Our experimental results demonstrate DynLS's superior performance, consistently delivering high-quality solutions within 1000 seconds. DynLS outperformed five leading algorithms across 360 test instances, achieving the best solution for 350 instances and surpassing the second-best algorithm, Cyclic-Fast, by 177 instances. Moreover, DynLS matched Cyclic-Fast's convergence speed, highlighting its efficiency and practicality.

However, in large-scale settings, MARL faces constraints due to extensive data sharing and communication requirements. Federated learning (FL) mitigates these challenges by training shared models without directly exchanging raw data, yet traditional FL methods such as FedAvg struggle with highly heterogeneous intersections. Different intersections exhibit varying traffic patterns, demands, and road structures, so performing FedAvg across all agents is inefficient. To address this gap, we propose Hierarchical Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL) for ATSC. HFRL employs clustering-based or optimization-based techniques to dynamically group intersections and perform FedAvg independently within groups of intersections with similar characteristics, enabling more effective coordination and scalability than standard FedAvg. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world traffic networks demonstrate that HFRL not only outperforms both decentralized and standard federated RL approaches but also identifies suitable grouping patterns based on network structure or traffic demand, resulting in a more robust framework for distributed, heterogeneous systems.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent urban traffic management solutions.

Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) algorithms have emerged as a solution by dynamically adjusting signal timing based on real-time traffic conditions. However, the main limitation of such methods is that they are not transferable to environments under real-world constraints, such as balancing efficiency, minimizing collisions, and ensuring fairness across intersections. In this paper, we view the ATSC problem as a constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose a novel algorithm named Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with Lagrange Cost Estimator (MAPPO-LCE) to produce effective traffic signal control policies. Our approach integrates the Lagrange multipliers method to balance rewards and constraints, with a cost estimator for stable adjustment. We also introduce three constraints on the traffic network: GreenTime, GreenSkip, and PhaseSkip, which penalize traffic policies that do not conform to real-world scenarios. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MAPPO-LCE outperforms three baseline MARL algorithms by across all environments and traffic constraints (improving on MAPPO by 12.60%, IPPO by 10.29%, and QTRAN by 13.10%). Our results show that constrained MARL is a valuable tool for traffic planners to deploy scalable and efficient ATSC methods in real-world traffic networks.

However, most of the current traffic state representations are heuristically designed, with insufficient theoretical support. In this paper, we (1) develop a flexible, efficient, and theoretically grounded method, namely generalized phase pressure (G2P) control, which takes only simple lane features into consideration to decide which phase to be actuated; 2) extend the pressure control theory to a general form for multi-homogeneous-lane road networks based on queueing theory; (3) design a new traffic state representation based on the generalized phase state features from G2P control; and 4) develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm template named G2P-XLight, and two RL algorithms, G2P-MPLight and G2P-CoLight, by combining the generalized phase state representation with MPLight and CoLight, two well-performed RL methods for learning traffic signal control policies. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that G2P control outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) heuristic method in the transportation field and other recent human-designed heuristic methods; and that the newly proposed G2P-XLight significantly outperforms SOTA learning-based approaches.

An integral part of traffic management is understanding the turning movement counts (TMCs) at intersections, Accurate TMCs at intersections are crucial for traffic signal control, congestion mitigation, and road safety. In general, TMCs are obtained using physical sensors installed at intersections, but this approach can be cost-prohibitive and technically challenging, especially for cities with extensive road networks. Recent advancements in machine learning and data-driven approaches have offered promising alternatives for estimating TMCs. Traffic patterns can vary significantly across different intersections due to factors such as road geometry, traffic signal settings, and local driver behaviors. This domain discrepancy limits the generalizability and accuracy of machine learning models when applied to new or unseen intersections. In response to these limitations, this research proposes a novel framework leveraging domain adaptation (DA) to estimate TMCs at intersections by using traffic controller event-based data, road infrastructure data, and point-of-interest (POI) data. Evaluated on 30 intersections in Tucson, Arizona, the performance of the proposed DA framework was compared with state-of-the-art models and achieved the lowest values in terms of Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2412.09861</p></details> |

The burgeoning field of intelligent transportation systems, bolstered by artificial intelligence techniques and extensive data availability, offers new prospects for the implementation of ATSC. In this study, we introduce a parallel hybrid action space reinforcement learning model (PH-DDPG) that optimizes traffic signal phase and duration of traffic signals simultaneously, eliminating the need for sequential decision-making seen in traditional two-stage models. Our model features a task-specific parallel hybrid action space tailored for adaptive traffic control, which directly outputs discrete phase selections and their associated continuous duration parameters concurrently, thereby inherently addressing dynamic traffic adaptation through unified parametric optimization. %Our model features a unique parallel hybrid action space that allows for the simultaneous output of each action and its optimal parameters, streamlining the decision-making process. Furthermore, to ascertain the robustness and effectiveness of this approach, we executed ablation studies focusing on the utilization of a random action parameter mask within the critic network, which decouples the parameter space for individual actions, facilitating the use of preferable parameters for each action. The results from these studies confirm the efficacy of this method, distinctly enhancing real-world applicability</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, Reinforcement Learning</p></details> |

Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers adaptive solutions, but online MARL requires extensive interactions with the environment, making it costly and impractical. Offline MARL mitigates these challenges by using historical traffic data for training but faces significant difficulties with heterogeneous behavior policies in real-world datasets, where mixed-quality data complicates learning. We introduce OffLight, a novel offline MARL framework designed to handle heterogeneous behavior policies in TSC datasets. To improve learning efficiency, OffLight incorporates Importance Sampling (IS) to correct for distributional shifts and Return-Based Prioritized Sampling (RBPS) to focus on high-quality experiences. OffLight utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Variational Graph Autoencoder (GMM-VGAE) to capture the diverse distribution of behavior policies from local observations. Extensive experiments across real-world urban traffic scenarios show that OffLight outperforms existing offline RL methods, achieving up to a 7.8% reduction in average travel time and 11.2% decrease in queue length. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of OffLight's components in handling heterogeneous data and improving policy performance. These results highlight OffLight's scalability and potential to improve urban traffic management without the risks of online learning.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for TSC due to their exceptional problem-solving and generalization capabilities, existing approaches fail to address the essential need for inter-agent coordination, limiting their effectiveness in achieving network-wide optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose CoLLMLight, a cooperative LLM agent framework for TSC. Specifically, we first construct a structured spatiotemporal graph to capture real-time traffic dynamics and spatial relationships among neighboring intersections, enabling the LLM to reason about complex traffic interactions. Moreover, we introduce a complexity-aware reasoning mechanism that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on real-time traffic conditions, ensuring optimal computational efficiency without sacrificing decision quality. Besides, we propose a fine-tuning strategy that leverages iterative simulation-driven data collection and environmental feedback to build a lightweight LLM tailored for cooperative TSC. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CoLLMLight outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse traffic scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness, scalability, and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review, 14 pages</p></details> |

Recent advancements in parameter-sharing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have greatly enhanced the scalable and adaptive optimization of complex, dynamic flows in large-scale homogeneous networks. However, the inherent heterogeneity of real-world traffic networks, with their varied intersection topologies and interaction dynamics, poses substantial challenges to achieving scalable and effective ATSC across different traffic scenarios. To address these challenges, we present Unicorn, a universal and collaborative MARL framework designed for efficient and adaptable network-wide ATSC. Specifically, we first propose a unified approach to map the states and actions of intersections with varying topologies into a common structure based on traffic movements. Next, we design a Universal Traffic Representation (UTR) module with a decoder-only network for general feature extraction, enhancing the model's adaptability to diverse traffic scenarios. Additionally, we incorporate an Intersection Specifics Representation (ISR) module, designed to identify key latent vectors that represent the unique intersection's topology and traffic dynamics through variational inference techniques. To further refine these latent representations, we employ a contrastive learning approach in a self-supervised manner, which enables better differentiation of intersection-specific features. Moreover, we integrate the state-action dependencies of neighboring agents into policy optimization, which effectively captures dynamic agent interactions and facilitates efficient regional collaboration. Our results show that Unicorn outperforms other methods across various evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential in complex, dynamic traffic networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-scale Regional Traffic Signal Control Based on Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09252v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of global urbanization and motorization, traffic congestion has become a significant issue, severely affecting the quality of life, environment, and economy. This paper puts forward a single-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based regional traffic signal control (TSC) model. Different from multi - agent systems, this model can coordinate traffic signals across a large area, with the goals of alleviating regional traffic congestion and minimizing the total travel time. The TSC environment is precisely defined through specific state space, action space, and reward functions. The state space consists of the current congestion state, which is represented by the queue lengths of each link, and the current signal phase scheme of intersections. The action space is designed to select an intersection first and then adjust its phase split. Two reward functions are meticulously crafted. One focuses on alleviating congestion and the other aims to minimize the total travel time while considering the congestion level. The experiments are carried out with the SUMO traffic simulation software. The performance of the TSC model is evaluated by comparing it with a base case where no signal-timing adjustments are made. The results show that the model can effectively control congestion. For example, the queuing length is significantly reduced in the scenarios tested. Moreover, when the reward is set to both alleviate congestion and minimize the total travel time, the average travel time is remarkably decreased, which indicates that the model can effectively improve traffic conditions. This research provides a new approach for large-scale regional traffic signal control and offers valuable insights for future urban traffic management.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2503.02279</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Traffic Signal Control through Model-based Reinforcement Learning and Policy Reuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08728v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown significant potential in traffic signal control (TSC). However, current MARL-based methods often suffer from insufficient generalization due to the fixed traffic patterns and road network conditions used during training. This limitation results in poor adaptability to new traffic scenarios, leading to high retraining costs and complex deployment. To address this challenge, we propose two algorithms: PLight and PRLight. PLight employs a model-based reinforcement learning approach, pretraining control policies and environment models using predefined source-domain traffic scenarios. The environment model predicts the state transitions, which facilitates the comparison of environmental features. PRLight further enhances adaptability by adaptively selecting pre-trained PLight agents based on the similarity between the source and target domains to accelerate the learning process in the target domain. We evaluated the algorithms through two transfer settings: (1) adaptability to different traffic scenarios within the same road network, and (2) generalization across different road networks. The results show that PRLight significantly reduces the adaptation time compared to learning from scratch in new TSC scenarios, achieving optimal performance using similarities between available and target scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using a single actor to output personalized policy for different intersections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07678v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, with the development of Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) has achieved satisfactory results. In traffic scenarios with multiple intersections, MARL treats each intersection as an agent and optimizes traffic signal control strategies through learning and real-time decision-making. Considering that observation distributions of intersections might be different in real-world scenarios, shared parameter methods might lack diversity and thus lead to high generalization requirements in the shared-policy network. A typical solution is to increase the size of network parameters. However, simply increasing the scale of the network does not necessarily improve policy generalization, which is validated in our experiments. Accordingly, an approach that considers both the personalization of intersections and the efficiency of parameter sharing is required. To this end, we propose Hyper-Action Multi-Head Proximal Policy Optimization (HAMH-PPO), a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL method that utilizes a shared PPO policy network to deliver personalized policies for intersections with non-iid observation distributions. The centralized critic in HAMH-PPO uses graph attention units to calculate the graph representations of all intersections and outputs a set of value estimates with multiple output heads for each intersection. The decentralized execution actor takes the local observation history as input and output distributions of action as well as a so-called hyper-action to balance the multiple values estimated from the centralized critic to further guide the updating of TSC policies. The combination of hyper-action and multi-head values enables multiple agents to share a single actor-critic while achieving personalized policies.</p></details> |  |

However, current RL algorithms necessitate excessive interaction with the environment to learn effective policies, making them impractical for large-scale tasks. The DreamerV3 algorithm presents compelling properties for policy learning. It summarizes general dynamics knowledge about the environment and enables the prediction of future outcomes of potential actions from past experience, reducing the interaction with the environment through imagination training. In this paper, a corridor TSC model is trained using the DreamerV3 algorithm to explore the benefits of world models for TSC strategy learning. In RL environment design, to manage congestion levels effectively, both the state and reward functions are defined based on queue length, and the action is designed to manage queue length efficiently. Using the SUMO simulation platform, the two hyperparameters (training ratio and model size) of the DreamerV3 algorithm were tuned and analyzed across different OD matrix scenarios. We discovered that choosing a smaller model size and initially attempting several medium training ratios can significantly reduce the time spent on hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we found that the approach is generally applicable as it can solve two TSC task scenarios with the same hyperparameters. Regarding the claimed data-efficiency of the DreamerV3 algorithm, due to the significant fluctuation of the episode reward curve in the early stages of training, it can only be confirmed that larger model sizes exhibit modest data-efficiency, and no evidence was found that increasing the training ratio accelerates convergence.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Toward Dependency Dynamics in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16608v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) emerges as a promising data-driven approach for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) in complex urban traffic networks, with deep neural networks substantially augmenting its learning capabilities. However, centralized RL becomes impractical for ATSC involving multiple agents due to the exceedingly high dimensionality of the joint action space. Multi-agent RL (MARL) mitigates this scalability issue by decentralizing control to local RL agents. Nevertheless, this decentralized method introduces new challenges: the environment becomes partially observable from the perspective of each local agent due to constrained inter-agent communication. Both centralized RL and MARL exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses, particularly under heavy intersectional traffic conditions. In this paper, we justify that MARL can achieve the optimal global Q-value by separating into multiple IRL (Independent Reinforcement Learning) processes when no spill-back congestion occurs (no agent dependency) among agents (intersections). In the presence of spill-back congestion (with agent dependency), the maximum global Q-value can be achieved by using centralized RL. Building upon the conclusions, we propose a novel Dynamic Parameter Update Strategy for Deep Q-Network (DQN-DPUS), which updates the weights and bias based on the dependency dynamics among agents, i.e. updating only the diagonal sub-matrices for the scenario without spill-back congestion. We validate the DQN-DPUS in a simple network with two intersections under varying traffic, and show that the proposed strategy can speed up the convergence rate without sacrificing optimal exploration. The results corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the efficacy of DQN-DPUS in optimizing traffic signal control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communication Strategy on Macro-and-Micro Traffic State in Cooperative Deep Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13248v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) has become a popular research topic in intelligent transportation systems. Regional Traffic Signal Control (RTSC) using the Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) technique has become a promising approach for ATSC due to its ability to achieve the optimum trade-off between scalability and optimality. Most existing RTSC approaches partition a traffic network into several disjoint regions, followed by applying centralized reinforcement learning techniques to each region. However, the pursuit of cooperation among RTSC agents still remains an open issue and no communication strategy for RTSC agents has been investigated. In this paper, we propose communication strategies to capture the correlation of micro-traffic states among lanes and the correlation of macro-traffic states among intersections. We first justify the evolution equation of the RTSC process is Markovian via a system of store-and-forward queues. Next, based on the evolution equation, we propose two GAT-Aggregated (GA2) communication modules--GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug to extract both intra-region and inter-region correlations between macro and micro traffic states. While GA2-Naive only considers the movements at each intersection, GA2-Aug also considers the lane-changing behavior of vehicles. Two proposed communication modules are then aggregated into two existing novel RTSC frameworks--RegionLight and Regional-DRL. Experimental results demonstrate that both GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug effectively improve the performance of existing RTSC frameworks under both real and synthetic scenarios. Hyperparameter testing also reveals the robustness and potential of our communication modules in large-scale traffic networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FitLight: Federated Imitation Learning for Plug-and-Play Autonomous Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11937v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Traffic Signal Control (TSC) methods have been extensively studied, their practical applications still raise some serious issues such as high learning cost and poor generalizability. This is because the ``trial-and-error'' training style makes RL agents extremely dependent on the specific traffic environment, which also requires a long convergence time. To address these issues, we propose a novel Federated Imitation Learning (FIL)-based framework for multi-intersection TSC, named FitLight, which allows RL agents to plug-and-play for any traffic environment without additional pre-training cost. Unlike existing imitation learning approaches that rely on pre-training RL agents with demonstrations, FitLight allows real-time imitation learning and seamless transition to reinforcement learning. Due to our proposed knowledge-sharing mechanism and novel hybrid pressure-based agent design, RL agents can quickly find a best control policy with only a few episodes. Moreover, for resource-constrained TSC scenarios, FitLight supports model pruning and heterogeneous model aggregation, such that RL agents can work on a micro-controller with merely 16{\it KB} RAM and 32{\it KB} ROM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, FitLight not only provides a superior starting point but also converges to a better final solution on both real-world and synthetic datasets, even under extreme resource limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-hop Upstream Anticipatory Traffic Signal Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07271v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordination in traffic signal control is crucial for managing congestion in urban networks. Existing pressure-based control methods focus only on immediate upstream links, leading to suboptimal green time allocation and increased network delays. However, effective signal control inherently requires coordination across a broader spatial scope, as the effect of upstream traffic should influence signal control decisions at downstream intersections, impacting a large area in the traffic network. Although agent communication using neural network-based feature extraction can implicitly enhance spatial awareness, it significantly increases the learning complexity, adding an additional layer of difficulty to the challenging task of control in deep reinforcement learning. To address the issue of learning complexity and myopic traffic pressure definition, our work introduces a novel concept based on Markov chain theory, namely \textit{multi-hop upstream pressure}, which generalizes the conventional pressure to account for traffic conditions beyond the immediate upstream links. This farsighted and compact metric informs the deep reinforcement learning agent to preemptively clear the multi-hop upstream queues, guiding the agent to optimize signal timings with a broader spatial awareness. Simulations on synthetic and realistic (Toronto) scenarios demonstrate controllers utilizing multi-hop upstream pressure significantly reduce overall network delay by prioritizing traffic movements based on a broader understanding of upstream congestion.</p></details> | 5 tables, 11 figures |

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been used to solve TSC problems and achieve superior performance over conventional TSC methods. However, applying RL methods to the real world is challenging due to the huge cost of experiments in real-world traffic environments. One possible solution is TSC domain adaptation, which adapts trained models to target environments and reduces the number of interactions and the training cost. However, existing TSC domain adaptation methods still face two major issues: the lack of consideration for differences across cities and the low utilization of multi-city data. To solve aforementioned issues, we propose an approach named Adaptive Modularized Model (AMM). By modularizing TSC problems and network models, we overcome the challenge of possible changes in environmental observations. We also aggregate multi-city experience through meta-learning. We conduct extensive experiments on different cities and show that AMM can achieve excellent performance with limited interactions in target environments and outperform existing methods. We also demonstrate the feasibility and generalizability of our method.</p></details> |  |

Many existing RL algorithms in the literature rely on the stationarity assumption that requires the system transition and the reward function to be constant over time. However, the stationarity assumption is restrictive in practice and is likely to be violated in a number of applications, including traffic signal control, robotics and mobile health. In this paper, we develop a consistent procedure to test the nonstationarity of the optimal Q-function based on pre-collected historical data, without additional online data collection. Based on the proposed test, we further develop a sequential change point detection method that can be naturally coupled with existing state-of-the-art RL methods for policy optimization in nonstationary environments. The usefulness of our method is illustrated by theoretical results, simulation studies, and a real data example from the 2018 Intern Health Study.

Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have demonstrated promising performance in achieving ATSC, existing methods are still prone to making unreasonable policies. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Critique-Tune-Based Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Pressure for multi-intersection signal control (BCT-APLight). In BCT-APLight, the Critique-Tune (CT) framework, a two-layer Bayesian structure is designed to refine the excessive trust of RL policies. Specifically, the Bayesian inference-based Critique Layer provides effective evaluations of the credibility of policies; the Bayesian decision-based Tune Layer fine-tunes policies by minimizing the posterior risks when the evaluations are negative. Meanwhile, an attention-based Adaptive Pressure (AP) mechanism is designed to effectively weight the vehicle queues in each lane, thereby enhancing the rationality of traffic movement representation within the network. Equipped with the CT framework and AP mechanism, BCT-APLight effectively enhances the reasonableness of RL policies. Extensive experiments conducted with a simulator across a range of intersection layouts demonstrate that BCT-APLight is superior to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on seven real-world datasets. Specifically, BCT-APLight decreases average queue length by \textbf{\(\boldsymbol{9.60\%}\)} and average waiting time by \textbf{\(\boldsymbol{15.28\%}\)}.</p></details> |  |

Current SOTA methods model road networks as topological graph structures, incorporate graph attention into deep Q-learning, and merge local and global embeddings to improve policy. However, graph-based methods are difficult to parallelize, resulting in huge time overhead. Moreover, none of the current peer studies have deployed dynamic traffic systems for experiments, which is far from the actual situation. In this context, we propose Multi-Scene Aggregation Convolutional Learning for traffic signal control (MacLight), which offers faster training speeds and more stable performance. Our approach consists of two main components. The first is the global representation, where we utilize variational autoencoders to compactly compress and extract the global representation. The second component employs the proximal policy optimization algorithm as the backbone, allowing value evaluation to consider both local features and global embedding representations. This backbone model significantly reduces time overhead and ensures stability in policy updates. We validated our method across multiple traffic scenarios under both static and dynamic traffic systems. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to general and domian SOTA methods, our approach achieves superior stability, optimized convergence levels and the highest time efficiency.

Our hierarchical, heterogeneous, and directed graph neural network architecture effectively captures granular traffic dynamics, enabling transferability to arbitrary intersection layouts. Using a decentralized multi-agent approach, global rewards, and novel state transition priors, we develop a single, weight-tied policy that scales zero-shot to any road network without re-training.

Traditional TSC methods, primarily based on transportation engineering and reinforcement learning (RL), often struggle with generalization abilities across varied traffic scenarios and lack interpretability. This paper presents LLMLight, a novel framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) as decision-making agents for TSC. Specifically, the framework begins by instructing the LLM with a knowledgeable prompt detailing real-time traffic conditions. Leveraging the advanced generalization capabilities of LLMs, LLMLight engages a reasoning and decision-making process akin to human intuition for effective traffic control. Moreover, we build LightGPT, a specialized backbone LLM tailored for TSC tasks. By learning nuanced traffic patterns and control strategies, LightGPT enhances the LLMLight framework cost-effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-world and synthetic datasets, along with evaluations by fifteen human experts, demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness, generalization ability, and interpretability of LLMLight with LightGPT, outperforming nine baseline methods and ten advanced LLMs.</p></details> |  |

| **[Data-Driven Transfer Learning Framework for Estimating Turning Movement Counts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09861v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban transportation networks are vital for the efficient movement of people and goods, necessitating effective traffic management and planning. An integral part of traffic management is understanding the turning movement counts (TMCs) at intersections, Accurate TMCs at intersections are crucial for traffic signal control, congestion mitigation, and road safety. In general, TMCs are obtained using physical sensors installed at intersections, but this approach can be cost-prohibitive and technically challenging, especially for cities with extensive road networks. Recent advancements in machine learning and data-driven approaches have offered promising alternatives for estimating TMCs. Traffic patterns can vary significantly across different intersections due to factors such as road geometry, traffic signal settings, and local driver behaviors. This domain discrepancy limits the generalizability and accuracy of machine learning models when applied to new or unseen intersections. In response to these limitations, this research proposes a novel framework leveraging transfer learning (TL) to estimate TMCs at intersections by using traffic controller event-based data, road infrastructure data, and point-of-interest (POI) data. Evaluated on 30 intersections in Tucson, Arizona, the performance of the proposed TL model was compared with eight state-of-the-art regression models and achieved the lowest values in terms of Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error.</p></details> |  |

Intelligent transportation, leveraging advanced computer algorithms, could further increase people's daily commuting efficiency. However, intelligent transportation, as a cross-discipline, often requires practitioners to comprehend complicated algorithms and obscure neural networks, bringing a challenge for the advanced techniques to be trusted and deployed in practical industries. Recognizing the expressiveness of the pre-trained large language models, especially the potential of being augmented with abilities to understand and execute intricate commands, we introduce Open-TI. Serving as a bridge to mitigate the industry-academic gap, Open-TI is an innovative model targeting the goal of Turing Indistinguishable Traffic Intelligence, it is augmented with the capability to harness external traffic analysis packages based on existing conversations. Marking its distinction, Open-TI is the first method capable of conducting exhaustive traffic analysis from scratch - spanning from map data acquisition to the eventual execution in complex simulations. Besides, Open-TI is able to conduct task-specific embodiment like training and adapting the traffic signal control policies (TSC), explore demand optimizations, etc. Furthermore, we explored the viability of LLMs directly serving as control agents, by understanding the expected intentions from Open-TI, we designed an agent-to-agent communication mode to support Open-TI conveying messages to ChatZero (control agent), and then the control agent would choose from the action space to proceed the execution. We eventually provide the formal implementation structure, and the open-ended design invites further community-driven enhancements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Preview version: https://rdcu.be/dHu0b, Github: https://github.com/DaRL-LibSignal/OpenTI</p></details> |

The first part of the study develops adaptive signal control based on MARL for a pair of coordinated intersections in a microscopic simulation environment. The two agents, one for each intersection, are centrally trained using a value decomposition network (VDN) architecture. The trained agents show slightly better performance compared to coordinated actuated signal control based on overall intersection delay at v/c of 0.95. In the second part of the study the trained signal control agents are used as background signal controllers while developing event-based TSP agents. In one variation, independent TSP agents are formulated and trained under a decentralized training and decentralized execution (DTDE) framework to implement TSP at each intersection. In the second variation, the two TSP agents are centrally trained under a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework and VDN architecture to select and implement coordinated TSP strategies across the two intersections. In both cases the agents converge to the same bus delay value, but independent agents show high instability throughout the training process. For the test runs, the two independent agents reduce bus delay across the two intersections by 22% compared to the no TSP case while the coordinated TSP agents achieve 27% delay reduction. In both cases, there is only a slight increase in delay for a majority of the side street movements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Traffic Signal Control using High-Dimensional State Representation and Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07759v1)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reinforcement learning-based (RL-based) traffic signal control (TSC), decisions on the signal timing are made based on the available information on vehicles at a road intersection. This forms the state representation for the RL environment which can either be high-dimensional containing several variables or a low-dimensional vector. Current studies suggest that using high dimensional state representations does not lead to improved performance on TSC. However, we argue, with experimental results, that the use of high dimensional state representations can, in fact, lead to improved TSC performance with improvements up to 17.9% of the average waiting time. This high-dimensional representation is obtainable using the cost-effective vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, encouraging its adoption for TSC. Additionally, given the large size of the state, we identified the need to have computational efficient models and explored model compression via pruning.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, they can also be the bottleneck of traffic flows as a result of traffic incidents or the absence of traffic coordination mechanisms such as traffic lights. Recently, various control and coordination mechanisms that are beyond traditional control methods have been proposed to improve the efficiency of intersection traffic by leveraging the ability of autonomous vehicles. Amongst these methods, the control of foreseeable mixed traffic that consists of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and robot vehicles (RVs) has emerged. We propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for the control and coordination of mixed traffic by RVs at real-world, complex intersections -- an open challenge to date. We design comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness, robustness, generalizablility, and adaptability of our approach. In particular, our method can prevent congestion formation via merely 5% RVs under a real-world traffic demand of 700 vehicles per hour. In contrast, without RVs, congestion will form when the traffic demand reaches as low as 200 vehicles per hour. Moreover, when the RV penetration rate exceeds 60%, our method starts to outperform traffic signal control in terms of the average waiting time of all vehicles. Our method is not only robust against blackout events, sudden RV percentage drops, and V2V communication error, but also enjoys excellent generalizablility, evidenced by its successful deployment in five unseen intersections. Lastly, our method performs well under various traffic rules, demonstrating its adaptability to diverse scenarios.

However, most existing works for TSC assume that traffic data from all surrounding intersections is fully and continuously available through sensors. In real-world applications, this assumption often fails due to sensor malfunctions or data loss, making TSC with missing data a critical challenge. To meet the needs of practical applications, we introduce DiffLight, a novel conditional diffusion model for TSC under data-missing scenarios in the offline setting. Specifically, we integrate two essential sub-tasks, i.e., traffic data imputation and decision-making, by leveraging a Partial Rewards Conditioned Diffusion (PRCD) model to prevent missing rewards from interfering with the learning process. Meanwhile, to effectively capture the spatial-temporal dependencies among intersections, we design a Spatial-Temporal transFormer (STFormer) architecture. In addition, we propose a Diffusion Communication Mechanism (DCM) to promote better communication and control performance under data-missing scenarios. Extensive experiments on five datasets with various data-missing scenarios demonstrate that DiffLight is an effective controller to address TSC with missing data.

One promising solution to tackle this problem is intelligent traffic signal control (TSC). Recently, TSC strategies leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) have garnered attention among researchers. However, the evaluation of these models has primarily relied on fixed metrics like reward and queue length. This limited evaluation approach provides only a narrow view of the model's decision-making process, impeding its practical implementation. Moreover, effective TSC necessitates coordinated actions across multiple intersections. Existing visual analysis solutions fall short when applied in multi-agent settings. In this study, we delve into the challenge of interpretability in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), particularly within the context of TSC. We propose MARLens a visual analytics system tailored to understand MARL-based TSC. Our system serves as a versatile platform for both RL and TSC researchers. It empowers them to explore the model's features from various perspectives, revealing its decision-making processes and shedding light on interactions among different agents. To facilitate quick identification of critical states, we have devised multiple visualization views, complemented by a traffic simulation module that allows users to replay specific training scenarios. To validate the utility of our proposed system, we present three comprehensive case studies, incorporate insights from domain experts through interviews, and conduct a user study. These collective efforts underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of MARLens in enhancing our understanding of MARL-based TSC systems and pave the way for more informed and efficient traffic management strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures; Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 2024</p></details> |

Learning-based optimization methods require extensive interactions with highly realistic microscopic traffic simulators. However, existing microscopic traffic simulators are inefficient in large-scale scenarios and thus fail to support the adoption of these methods in large-scale transportation system optimization scenarios. In addition, the optimization scenarios supported by existing simulators are limited, mainly focusing on the traffic signal control. To address these challenges, we propose the first open-source GPU-accelerated large-scale microscopic simulator for transportation system simulation and optimization. The simulator can iterate at 84.09Hz, which achieves 88.92 times computational acceleration in the large-scale scenario with 2,464,950 vehicles compared to the best baseline CityFlow. Besides, it achieves a more realistic average road speeds simulated on real datasets by adopting the IDM model as the car-following model and the randomized MOBIL model as the lane-changing model. Based on it, we implement a set of microscopic and macroscopic controllable objects and metrics provided by Python API to support typical transportation system optimization scenarios. We choose five representative scenarios and benchmark classical rule-based algorithms, reinforcement learning algorithms, and black-box optimization algorithms in four cities. These experiments effectively demonstrate the usability of the simulator for large-scale traffic system optimization.

However, in current decades, it continues to pose significant challenges in managing large-scale traffic networks, coordinating intersections, and ensuring robustness under uncertain traffic conditions. This paper presents a scalable multi-objective optimization approach for robust traffic signal control in dynamic and uncertain urban environments. A multi-objective optimization model is proposed in this paper, which incorporates stochastic variables and probabilistic traffic patterns to capture traffic flow dynamics and uncertainty. We propose an algorithm named Adaptive Hybrid Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithm (AHMOA), which addresses the uncertainties of city traffic, including network-wide signal coordination, fluctuating patterns, and environmental impacts. AHMOA simultaneously optimizes multiple objectives, such as average delay, network stability, and system robustness, while adapting to unpredictable changes in traffic. The algorithm combines evolutionary strategies with an adaptive mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation, and incorporates a memory-based evaluation mechanism to leverage historical traffic data. Simulations are conducted in different cities including Manhattan, Paris, Sao Paulo, and Istanbul. The experimental results demonstrate that AHMOA consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms and the algorithm is competent to provide scalable, robust Pareto optimal solutions for managing complex traffic systems under uncertain environments.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

However, the complexity of traffic networks has rendered traditional machine learning and statistical methods less effective. With the advent of artificial intelligence, deep learning frameworks have achieved remarkable progress across various fields and are now considered highly effective in many areas. Since 2019, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a particularly promising deep learning approach within the ITS domain, owing to their robust ability to model graph-structured data and address complex problems. Consequently, there has been increasing scholarly attention to the applications of GNNs in transportation, which have demonstrated excellent performance. Nevertheless, current research predominantly focuses on traffic forecasting, with other ITS domains, such as autonomous vehicles and demand prediction, receiving less attention. This paper aims to review the applications of GNNs across six representative and emerging ITS research areas: traffic forecasting, vehicle control system, traffic signal control, transportation safety, demand prediction, and parking management. We have examined a wide range of graph-related studies from 2018 to 2023, summarizing their methodologies, features, and contributions in detailed tables and lists.

As an alternative, optimizing existing traffic management systems, particularly through adaptive traffic signal control, offers a promising solution. This paper explores the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance traffic signal operations at intersections, aiming to reduce congestion without extensive sensor networks. We introduce two RL-based algorithms: a turn-based agent, which dynamically prioritizes traffic signals based on real-time queue lengths, and a time-based agent, which adjusts signal phase durations according to traffic conditions while following a fixed phase cycle. By representing the state as a scalar queue length, our approach simplifies the learning process and lowers deployment costs.

Traditional forecasting methods, however, struggle with the irregular traffic time series resulting from adaptive traffic signal controls, presenting challenges in asynchronous spatial dependency, irregular temporal dependency, and predicting variable-length sequences. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) tailored for irregular traffic time series forecasting. Specifically, we first propose an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to capture the spatial dependency between asynchronously measured traffic states regulated by adaptive traffic signals. After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state sequences, a personalized time encoding is devised to embed the continuous time signals. Then, we propose a Transformable Time-aware Convolution Network, which adapts meta-filters for time-aware convolution on the sequences with inconsistent temporal flow. Additionally, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network, comprising a state evolution unit and a semi-autoregressive predictor, is designed to predict variable-length traffic sequences effectively and efficiently.

The proposed approach aims to enhance control strategies at intersections while simultaneously addressing safety, efficiency, and decarbonization objectives. Traditional ATSC methods typically prioritize traffic efficiency and often struggle to adapt to real-time dynamic traffic conditions. To address these challenges, the study suggests a DRL-based ATSC algorithm that incorporates the Dueling Double Deep Q Network (D3QN) framework. The performance of this algorithm is assessed using a simulated intersection in Changsha, China. Notably, the proposed ATSC algorithm surpasses both traditional ATSC and ATSC algorithms focused solely on efficiency optimization by achieving over a 16% reduction in traffic conflicts and a 4% decrease in carbon emissions. Regarding traffic efficiency, waiting time is reduced by 18% compared to traditional ATSC, albeit showing a slight increase (0.64%) compared to the DRL-based ATSC algorithm integrating the D3QN framework. This marginal increase suggests a trade-off between efficiency and other objectives like safety and decarbonization. Additionally, the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance, particularly in scenarios with high traffic demand, across all three objectives. These findings contribute to advancing traffic control systems by offering a practical and effective solution for optimizing signal control strategies in real-world traffic situations.</p></details> |  |

| **[GuideLight: "Industrial Solution" Guidance for More Practical Traffic Signal Control Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10811v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, traffic signal control (TSC) methods based on reinforcement learning (RL) have proven superior to traditional methods. However, most RL methods face difficulties when applied in the real world due to three factors: input, output, and the cycle-flow relation. The industry's observable input is much more limited than simulation-based RL methods. For real-world solutions, only flow can be reliably collected, whereas common RL methods need more. For the output action, most RL methods focus on acyclic control, which real-world signal controllers do not support. Most importantly, industry standards require a consistent cycle-flow relationship: non-decreasing and different response strategies for low, medium, and high-level flows, which is ignored by the RL methods. To narrow the gap between RL methods and industry standards, we innovatively propose to use industry solutions to guide the RL agent. Specifically, we design behavior cloning and curriculum learning to guide the agent to mimic and meet industry requirements and, at the same time, leverage the power of exploration and exploitation in RL for better performance. We theoretically prove that such guidance can largely decrease the sample complexity to polynomials in the horizon when searching for an optimal policy. Our rigid experiments show that our method has good cycle-flow relation and superior performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review of IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

Significant progress has been made for biomolecules and crystalline materials. Here, we address amorphous materials (glasses), which are disordered particle systems lacking atomic periodicity. Sampling equilibrium configurations of glass-forming materials is a notoriously slow and difficult task. This obstacle could be overcome by developing a generative framework capable of producing equilibrium configurations with well-defined likelihoods. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging an equivariant Riemannian stochastic interpolation framework which combines Riemannian stochastic interpolant and equivariant flow matching. Our method rigorously incorporates periodic boundary conditions and the symmetries of multi-component particle systems, adapting an equivariant graph neural network to operate directly on the torus. Our numerical experiments on model amorphous systems demonstrate that enforcing geometric and symmetry constraints significantly improves generative performance.</p></details> |  |

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Access (Early Access)</p></details> |
| **[GFLAN: Generative Functional Layouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16275v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated floor plan generation lies at the intersection of combinatorial search, geometric constraint satisfaction, and functional design requirements -- a confluence that has historically resisted a unified computational treatment. While recent deep learning approaches have improved the state of the art, they often struggle to capture architectural reasoning: the precedence of topological relationships over geometric instantiation, the propagation of functional constraints through adjacency networks, and the emergence of circulation patterns from local connectivity decisions. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces GFLAN, a generative framework that restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization. Given a single exterior boundary and a front-door location, our approach departs from direct pixel-to-pixel or wall-tracing generation in favor of a principled two-stage decomposition. Stage A employs a specialized convolutional architecture with dual encoders -- separating invariant spatial context from evolving layout state -- to sequentially allocate room centroids within the building envelope via discrete probability maps over feasible placements. Stage B constructs a heterogeneous graph linking room nodes to boundary vertices, then applies a Transformer-augmented graph neural network (GNN) that jointly regresses room boundaries.</p></details> | 21 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Sharpness-aware Federated Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16247v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of many impediments to applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to large-scale real-world graph data is the challenge of centralized training, which requires aggregating data from different organizations, raising privacy concerns. Federated graph learning (FGL) addresses this by enabling collaborative GNN model training without sharing private data. However, a core challenge in FGL systems is the variation in local training data distributions among clients, known as the data heterogeneity problem. Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data. By introducing a regularizer based on the correlation matrix of local representations, we relax the correlations of representations generated by individual local graph samples, so as to alleviate the dimensional collapse of the learned model. The proposed \textbf{S}harpness-aware f\textbf{E}derated gr\textbf{A}ph \textbf{L}earning (SEAL) algorithm can enhance the classification accuracy and generalization ability of local GNN models in federated graph learning. Experimental studies on several graph classification benchmarks show that SEAL consistently outperforms SOTA FGL baselines and provides gains for more participants.</p></details> | Accepted by WSDM'26 |

Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

This paper is a thorough guide to examine the changing reranker landscape and offer a clear view of the advancements made in reranking methods. We present a comprehensive survey of reranking models employed in IR, particularly within modern Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, where retrieved documents notably influence output quality. We embark on a chronological journey through the historical trajectory of reranking techniques, starting with foundational approaches, before exploring the wide range of sophisticated neural network architectures such as cross-encoders, sequence-generation models like T5, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) utilized for structural information. Recognizing the computational cost of advancing neural rerankers, we analyze techniques for enhancing efficiency, notably knowledge distillation for creating competitive, lighter alternatives. Furthermore, we map the emerging territory of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in reranking, examining novel prompting strategies and fine-tuning tactics. This survey seeks to elucidate the fundamental ideas, relative effectiveness, computational features, and real-world trade-offs of various reranking strategies. The survey provides a structured synthesis of the diverse reranking paradigms, highlighting their underlying principles and comparative strengths and weaknesses.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 1 figure, Accepted in CLNLP'25</p></details> |

Existing methods typically process spatial and feature views separately, fusing only at output level - an "encode-separately, fuse-late" paradigm that limits multi-scale semantic capture and cross-view interaction. Accordingly, stMFG is proposed, a multi-scale interactive fusion graph network that introduces layer-wise cross-view attention to dynamically integrate spatial and gene features after each convolution. The model combines cross-view contrastive learning with spatial constraints to enhance discriminability while maintaining spatial continuity. On DLPFC and breast cancer datasets, stMFG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 14% ARI improvement on certain slices.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[A Multimodal Approach to Alzheimer's Diagnosis: Geometric Insights from Cube Copying and Cognitive Assessments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16184v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early and accessible detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a critical clinical challenge, and cube-copying tasks offer a simple yet informative assessment of visuospatial function. This work proposes a multimodal framework that converts hand-drawn cube sketches into graph-structured representations capturing geometric and topological properties, and integrates these features with demographic information and neuropsychological test (NPT) scores for AD classification. Cube drawings are modeled as graphs with node features encoding spatial coordinates, local graphlet-based topology, and angular geometry, which are processed using graph neural networks and fused with age, education, and NPT features in a late-fusion model. Experimental results show that graph-based representations provide a strong unimodal baseline and substantially outperform pixel-based convolutional models, while multimodal integration further improves performance and robustness to class imbalance. SHAP-based interpretability analysis identifies specific graphlet motifs and geometric distortions as key predictors, closely aligning with clinical observations of disorganized cube drawings in AD. Together, these results establish graph-based analysis of cube copying as an interpretable, non-invasive, and scalable approach for Alzheimer's disease screening.</p></details> |  |
| **[SegGraph: Leveraging Graphs of SAM Segments for Few-Shot 3D Part Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16143v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel framework for few-shot 3D part segmentation. Recent advances have demonstrated the significant potential of 2D foundation models for low-shot 3D part segmentation. However, it is still an open problem that how to effectively aggregate 2D knowledge from foundation models to 3D. Existing methods either ignore geometric structures for 3D feature learning or neglects the high-quality grouping clues from SAM, leading to under-segmentation and inconsistent part labels. We devise a novel SAM segment graph-based propagation method, named SegGraph, to explicitly learn geometric features encoded within SAM's segmentation masks. Our method encodes geometric features by modeling mutual overlap and adjacency between segments while preserving intra-segment semantic consistency. We construct a segment graph, conceptually similar to an atlas, where nodes represent segments and edges capture their spatial relationships (overlap/adjacency). Each node adaptively modulates 2D foundation model features, which are then propagated via a graph neural network to learn global geometric structures. To enforce intra-segment semantic consistency, we map segment features to 3D points with a novel view-direction-weighted fusion attenuating contributions from low-quality segments. Extensive experiments on PartNet-E demonstrate that our method outperforms all competing baselines by at least 6.9 percent mIoU. Further analysis reveals that SegGraph achieves particularly strong performance on small components and part boundaries, demonstrating its superior geometric understanding.

| **[Beyond Force Metrics: Pre-Training MLFFs for Stable MD Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14850v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples) without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability, sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from scratch. By analyzing local properties of the learned force fields, we find that pre-training produces more structured latent representations, smoother force responses to local geometric changes, and more consistent force differences between nearby configurations, all of which contribute to more stable and reliable MD simulations. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a new application for GNNs in the physical sciences: instrumentation design. As a case study, we apply GNNs to simulate models of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and show that they are capable of accurately capturing the complex optical physics at play, while achieving runtimes 815 times faster than state of the art simulation packages. We discuss the unique challenges this problem provides for machine learning models. In addition, we provide a dataset of high-fidelity optical physics simulations for three interferometer topologies, which can be used as a benchmarking suite for future work in this direction.</p></details> |  |

Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\%$, which is a $3.7\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages.

However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-Aligned Protein Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16896v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein language models (pLMs) pre-trained on vast protein sequence databases excel at various downstream tasks but often lack the structural knowledge essential for some biological applications. To address this, we introduce a method to enrich pLMs with structural knowledge by leveraging pre-trained protein graph neural networks (pGNNs). First, a latent-level contrastive learning task aligns residue representations from pLMs with those from pGNNs across multiple proteins, injecting inter-protein structural information. Additionally, a physical-level task integrates intra-protein information by training pLMs to predict structure tokens. Together, the proposed dual-task framework effectively incorporates both inter- and intra-protein structural knowledge into pLMs. Given the variability in the quality of protein structures in PDB, we further introduce a residue loss selection module that uses a small model trained on high-quality structures to select reliable yet challenging residue losses for the pLM to learn. Applying our structure alignment method as a simple, lightweight post-training step to the state-of-the-art ESM2 and AMPLIFY yields notable performance gains. These improvements are consistent across a wide range of tasks, including substantial gains in deep mutational scanning (DMS) fitness prediction and a 59% increase in P@L for ESM2 650M contact prediction on CASP16. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these performance gains are robust, scaling with model sizes from 8M to 650M and extending to different downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Exact Verification of Graph Neural Networks with Incremental Constraint Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09320v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes applications, such as fraud detection or healthcare, but are susceptible to adversarial attacks. A number of techniques have been proposed to provide adversarial robustness guarantees, but support for commonly used aggregation functions in message-passing GNNs is lacking. In this paper, we develop an exact (sound and complete) verification method for GNNs to compute guarantees against attribute and structural perturbations that involve edge addition or deletion, subject to budget constraints. Our method employs constraint solving with bound tightening, and iteratively solves a sequence of relaxed constraint satisfaction problems while relying on incremental solving capabilities of solvers to improve efficiency. We implement GNNev, a versatile exact verifier for message-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions, sum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time. Extensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) and biochemical datasets (MUTAG and ENZYMES) demonstrates its usability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance for node classification and competitiveness on graph classification compared to existing exact verification tools on sum-aggregated GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Contextual Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Directed Controller Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15295v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controller synthesis is a formal method approach for automatically generating Labeled Transition System (LTS) controllers that satisfy specified properties. The efficiency of the synthesis process, however, is critically dependent on exploration policies. These policies often rely on fixed rules or strategies learned through reinforcement learning (RL) that consider only a limited set of current features. To address this limitation, this paper introduces GCRL, an approach that enhances RL-based methods by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GCRL encodes the history of LTS exploration into a graph structure, allowing it to capture a broader, non-current-based context. In a comparative experiment against state-of-the-art methods, GCRL exhibited superior learning efficiency and generalization across four out of five benchmark domains, except one particular domain characterized by high symmetry and strictly local interactions.</p></details> |  |

Given a graph and a pattern, the subgraph homomorphism problem involves finding a mapping from the pattern to the graph, ensuring that adjacent vertices in the pattern are mapped to adjacent vertices in the graph. Unlike subgraph isomorphism, which requires a one-to-one mapping, homomorphism allows multiple vertices in the pattern to map to the same vertex in the graph, making it more complex. We propose HFrame, the first graph neural network-based framework for subgraph homomorphism, which integrates traditional algorithms with machine learning techniques. We demonstrate that HFrame outperforms standard graph neural networks by being able to distinguish more graph pairs where the pattern is not homomorphic to the graph. Additionally, we provide a generalization error bound for HFrame. Through experiments on both real-world and synthetic graphs, we show that HFrame is up to 101.91 times faster than exact matching algorithms and achieves an average accuracy of 0.962.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |

Nevertheless, the limited distribution of training data for the extensively utilised machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), predominantly sourced from near-equilibrium structures, results in unreliable adsorption structures and consequent adsorption energy predictions. In this context, we present DBCata, a deep generative model that integrates a periodic Brownian-bridge framework with an equivariant graph neural network to establish a low-dimensional transition manifold between unrelaxed and DFT-relaxed structures, without requiring explicit energy or force information. Upon training, DBCata effectively generates high-fidelity adsorption geometries, achieving an interatomic distance mean absolute error (DMAE) of 0.035 \textÅ on the Catalysis-Hub dataset, which is nearly three times superior to that of the current state-of-the-art machine learning potential models. Moreover, the corresponding DFT accuracy can be improved within 0.1 eV in 94\% of instances by identifying and refining anomalous predictions through a hybrid chemical-heuristic and self-supervised outlier detection approach. We demonstrate that the remarkable performance of DBCata facilitates accelerated high-throughput computational screening for efficient alloy catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction, highlighting the potential of DBCata as a powerful tool for catalyst design and optimisation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a Dual-Axis Representation-Complete Convergent Learning (RCCL) strategy, enabled by a molecular representation that integrates graph convolutional network (GCN) encoding of local valence environments, grounded in modern valence bond theory, together with no-bridge graph (NBG) encoding of ring/cage topologies, providing a quantitative measure of chemical-space coverage. This framework formalizes representation completeness, establishing a principled basis for constructing datasets that support convergent learning for large models. Guided by this RCCL framework, we develop the FD25 dataset, systematically covering 13,302 local valence units and 165,726 ring/cage topologies, achieving near-complete combinatorial coverage of organic molecules with H/C/N/O/F elements. Graph neural networks trained on FD25 exhibit representation-complete convergent learning and strong out-of-distribution generalization, with an overall prediction error of approximately 1.0 kcal/mol MAE across external benchmarks. Our results establish a quantitative link between molecular representation, structural completeness, and model generalization, providing a foundation for interpretable, transferable, and data-efficient molecular intelligence.</p></details> | 33 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Convergent Privacy Framework for Multi-layer GNNs through Contractive Message Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22727v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential privacy (DP) has been integrated into graph neural networks (GNNs) to protect sensitive structural information, e.g., edges, nodes, and associated features across various applications. A prominent approach is to perturb the message-passing process, which forms the core of most GNN architectures. However, existing methods typically incur a privacy cost that grows linearly with the number of layers (e.g., GAP published in Usenix Security'23), ultimately requiring excessive noise to maintain a reasonable privacy level. This limitation becomes particularly problematic when multi-layer GNNs, which have shown better performance than one-layer GNN, are used to process graph data with sensitive information. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the privacy budget converges with respect to the number of layers by applying privacy amplification techniques to the message-passing process, exploiting the contractive properties inherent to standard GNN operations. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a simple yet effective Contractive Graph Layer (CGL) that ensures the contractiveness required for theoretical guarantees while preserving model utility. Our framework, CARIBOU, supports both training and inference, equipped with a contractive aggregation module, a privacy allocation module, and a privacy auditing module. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CARIBOU significantly improves the privacy-utility trade-off and achieves superior performance in privacy auditing tasks.</p></details> | 31 pages |

The primary task of gate-level reverse engineering is to separate the control and data signals from the netlist, which is mainly realized by identifying state registers with topological comparison.However, these methods become inefficient for large scale netlist. In this work, we propose RELIC-GNN, a graph neural network based state registers identification method, to address these issues. RELIC-GNN models the path structure of register as a graph and generates corresponding representation by considering node attributes and graph structure during training. The trained GNN model could be adopted to find the registers type very efficiently. Experimental results show that RELIC-GNN could achieve 100% in recall, 30.49% in precision and 88.37% in accuracy on average across different designs, which obtains significant improvements than previous approaches.</p></details> |  |

Prior approaches typically address these irregularities by interpolating data into regular sequences, thereby introducing bias, or by generating inconsistent and uninterpretable relationships across sensor measurements, complicating the accurate learning of both intra-series and inter-series dependencies. We introduce WaveGNN, a model that operates directly on irregular multivariate time series without interpolation or conversion to a regular representation. WaveGNN combines a decay-aware Transformer to capture intra-series dynamics with a sample-specific graph neural network that models both short-term and long-term inter-sensor relationships. Therefore, it generates a single, sparse, and interpretable graph per sample. Across multiple benchmark datasets (P12, P19, MIMIC-III, and PAM), WaveGNN delivers consistently strong performance, whereas other state-of-the-art baselines tend to perform well on some datasets or tasks but poorly on others. While WaveGNN does not necessarily surpass every method in every case, its consistency and robustness across diverse settings set it apart. Moreover, the learned graphs align well with known physiological structures, enhancing interpretability and supporting clinical decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE BigData 2025.

| **[Improving Graph Neural Network Training, Defense and Hypergraph Partitioning via Adversarial Robustness Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14738v9)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a highly effective neural network architecture for processing graph-structured data. Unlike traditional neural networks that rely solely on the features of the data as input, GNNs leverage both the graph structure, which represents the relationships between data points, and the feature matrix of the data to optimize their feature representation. This unique capability enables GNNs to achieve superior performance across various tasks. However, it also makes GNNs more susceptible to noise and adversarial attacks from both the graph structure and data features, which can significantly increase the training difficulty and degrade their performance. Similarly, a hypergraph is a highly complex structure, and partitioning a hypergraph is a challenging task. This paper leverages spectral adversarial robustness evaluation to effectively address key challenges in complex-graph algorithms. By using spectral adversarial robustness evaluation to distinguish robust nodes from non-robust ones and treating them differently, we propose a training-set construction strategy that improves the training quality of GNNs. In addition, we develop algorithms to enhance both the adversarial robustness of GNNs and the performance of hypergraph partitioning. Experimental results show that this series of methods is highly effective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network for Urban Spaces: Interpolating Citywide Traffic Volume](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06292v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks have shown strong performance in traffic volume forecasting, particularly on highways and major arterial networks. Applying them to urban settings, however, presents unique challenges: urban networks exhibit greater structural diversity, traffic volumes are highly overdispersed with many zeros, the best way to account for spatial dependencies remains unclear, and sensor coverage is often very sparse. We introduce the Graph Neural Network for Urban Interpolation (GNNUI), a novel urban traffic volume estimation approach. GNNUI employs a masking algorithm to learn interpolation, integrates node features to capture functional roles, and uses a loss function tailored to zero-inflated traffic distributions. In addition to the model, we introduce two new open, large-scale urban traffic volume benchmarks, covering different transportation modes: Strava cycling data from Berlin and New York City taxi data. GNNUI outperforms recent, some graph-based, interpolation methods across metrics (MAE, RMSE, true-zero rate, Kullback-Leibler divergence) and remains robust from 90% to 1% sensor coverage. For example, on the Strava dataset, the MAE increases only from 7.1 to 10.5, and on the Taxi dataset, from 23.0 to 40.4. These results demonstrate that GNNUI maintains strong performance despite extreme data scarcity, a common condition in real-world urban settings. We also examine how graph connectivity choices influence model accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATLAS: Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14908v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ATLAS (Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs), a novel graph learning algorithm that addresses two important challenges in graph neural networks (GNNs). First, the accuracy of GNNs degrades when the graph is heterophilic. Second, iterative feature aggregation limits the scalability of GNNs to large graphs. We address these challenges by extracting topological information about graph communities at multiple levels of refinement, concatenating community assignments to the feature vector, and applying multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to the resulting representation. This provides topological context about nodes and their neighborhoods without invoking aggregation. Because MLPs are typically more scalable than GNNs, our approach applies to large graphs without the need for sampling. Across a wide set of graphs, ATLAS achieves comparable accuracy to baseline methods, with gains as high as 20 percentage points over GCN for heterophilic graphs with negative structural bias and 11 percentage points over MLP for homophilic graphs. Furthermore, we show how multi-resolution community features systematically modulate performance in both homophilic and heterophilic settings, opening a principled path toward explainable graph learning.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, their complex structures and inner workings can be challenging for non-AI experts to understand. To address this issue, this study presents \name{}, an educational visualization tool for interactive learning of GNNs. GNN 101 introduces a set of animated visualizations that seamlessly integrate mathematical formulas with visualizations via multiple levels of abstraction, including a model overview, layer operations, and detailed calculations.

| **[A Roadmap for Applying Graph Neural Networks to Numerical Data: Insights from Cementitious Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14855v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly applied in concrete research to optimize performance and mixture design. However, one major challenge in applying ML to cementitious materials is the limited size and diversity of available databases. A promising solution is the development of multi-modal databases that integrate both numerical and graphical data. Conventional ML frameworks in cement research are typically restricted to a single data modality. Graph neural network (GNN) represents a new generation of neural architectures capable of learning from data structured as graphs, capturing relationships through irregular or topology-dependent connections rather than fixed spatial coordinates. While GNN is inherently designed for graphical data, they can be adapted to extract correlations from numerical datasets and potentially embed physical laws directly into their architecture, enabling explainable and physics-informed predictions. This work is among the first few studies to implement GNNs to design concrete, with a particular emphasis on establishing a clear and reproducible pathway for converting tabular data into graph representations using the k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) approach. Model hyperparameters and feature selection are systematically optimized to enhance prediction performance. The GNN shows performance comparable to the benchmark random forest, which has been demonstrated by many studies to yield reliable predictions for cementitious materials. Overall, this study provides a foundational roadmap for transitioning from traditional ML to advanced AI architectures. The proposed framework establishes a strong foundation for future multi-modal and physics-informed GNN models capable of capturing complex material behaviors and accelerating the design and optimization of cementitious materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[TomoGraphView: 3D Medical Image Classification with Omnidirectional Slice Representations and Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09605v3)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sharp rise in medical tomography examinations has created a demand for automated systems that can reliably extract informative features for downstream tasks such as tumor characterization. Although 3D volumes contain richer information than individual slices, effective 3D classification remains difficult: volumetric data encode complex spatial dependencies, and the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets has constrained progress toward 3D foundation models. As a result, many recent approaches rely on 2D vision foundation models trained on natural images, repurposing them as feature extractors for medical scans with surprisingly strong performance. Despite their practical success, current methods that apply 2D foundation models to 3D scans via slice-based decomposition remain fundamentally limited. Standard slicing along axial, sagittal, and coronal planes often fails to capture the true spatial extent of a structure when its orientation does not align with these canonical views. More critically, most approaches aggregate slice features independently, ignoring the underlying 3D geometry and losing spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. Instead of restricting the model to axial, sagittal, or coronal planes, our method samples both canonical and non-canonical cross-sections generated from uniformly distributed points on a sphere enclosing the volume. We publicly share our accessible code base at http://github.com/compai-lab/2025-MedIA-kiechle and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at https://pypi.org/project/OmniSlicer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Medical Image Analysis (MedIA)</p></details> |

One common challenge is the ability to optimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of DNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and antimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely on simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than high-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a geometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which learns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property space. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold that can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an appropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide the sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder layers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized latent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired properties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our framework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template fluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The trained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent space according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ sampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to 16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance in training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 figures, preprint</p></details> |
| **[A Graph-Based Forensic Framework for Inferring Hardware Noise of Cloud Quantum Backend](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14541v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud quantum platforms give users access to many backends with different qubit technologies, coupling layouts, and noise levels. The execution of a circuit, however, depends on internal allocation and routing policies that are not observable to the user. A provider may redirect jobs to more error-prone regions to conserve resources, balance load or for other opaque reasons, causing degradation in fidelity while still presenting stale or averaged calibration data. This lack of transparency creates a security gap: users cannot verify whether their circuits were executed on the hardware for which they were charged. Forensic methods that infer backend behavior from user-visible artifacts are therefore becoming essential. In this work, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based forensic framework that predicts per-qubit and per-qubit link error rates of an unseen backend using only topology information and aggregated features extracted from transpiled circuits. We construct a dataset from several IBM 27-qubit devices, merge static calibration features with dynamic transpilation features and train separate GNN regressors for one- and two-qubit errors. At inference time, the model operates without access to calibration data from the target backend and reconstructs a complete error map from the features available to the user. Our results on the target backend show accurate recovery of backend error rate, with an average mismatch of approximately 22% for single-qubit errors and 18% for qubit-link errors. The model also exhibits strong ranking agreement, with the ordering induced by predicted error values closely matching that of the actual calibration errors, as reflected by high Spearman correlation. The framework consistently identifies weak links and high-noise qubits and remains robust under realistic temporal noise drift.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

Traditional data-driven RCA methods are typically limited to offline applications due to high computational demands, and existing online RCA methods handle only single-modal data, overlooking complex interactions in multi-modal systems. In this paper, we introduce OCEAN, a novel online multi-modal causal structure learning method for root cause localization. OCEAN employs a dilated convolutional neural network to capture long-term temporal dependencies and graph neural networks to learn causal relationships among system entities and key performance indicators. We further design a multi-factor attention mechanism to analyze and reassess the relationships among different metrics and log indicators/attributes for enhanced online causal graph learning. Additionally, a contrastive mutual information maximization-based graph fusion module is developed to effectively model the relationships across various modalities. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BigData 2025</p></details> |

However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[GALAX: Graph-Augmented Language Model for Explainable Reinforcement-Guided Subgraph Reasoning in Precision Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20935v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context, and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability. Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations, and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context. Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated by a pretrained GNN and schema-based rule check, enabling process-level supervision without explicit labels. As an application, we also introduced Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines, which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable, reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable target discovery in precision medicine.</p></details> |  |

While scene graphs offer a structured abstraction of surgical events, their full potential remains untapped. In this work, we introduce ProtoFlow, a novel framework that learns dynamic scene graph prototypes to model complex surgical workflows in an interpretable and robust manner. Methods: ProtoFlow leverages a graph neural network (GNN) encoder-decoder architecture that combines self-supervised pretraining for rich representation learning with a prototype-based fine-tuning stage. This process discovers and refines core prototypes that encapsulate recurring, clinically meaningful patterns of surgical interaction, forming an explainable foundation for workflow analysis. Results: We evaluate our approach on the fine-grained CAT-SG dataset. ProtoFlow not only outperforms standard GNN baselines in overall accuracy but also demonstrates exceptional robustness in limited-data, few-shot scenarios, maintaining strong performance when trained on as few as one surgical video. Our qualitative analyses further show that the learned prototypes successfully identify distinct surgical sub-techniques and provide clear, interpretable insights into workflow deviations and rare complications. Conclusion: By uniting robust representation learning with inherent explainability, ProtoFlow represents a significant step toward developing more transparent, reliable, and data-efficient AI systems, accelerating their potential for clinical adoption in surgical training, real-time decision support, and workflow optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Hybrid Euclidean-SPD Manifold Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14023v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting plays a vital role in various real-world applications, such as traffic management and predictive maintenance. Existing approaches typically model MTS data in either Euclidean or Riemannian space, limiting their ability to capture the diverse geometric structures and complex spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in real-world data. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Hybrid Symmetric Positive-Definite Manifold Graph Neural Network (HSMGNN), a novel graph neural network-based model that captures data geometry within a hybrid Euclidean-Riemannian framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage hybrid geometric representations for MTS forecasting, enabling expressive and comprehensive modeling of geometric properties. Specifically, we introduce a Submanifold-Cross-Segment (SCS) embedding to project input MTS into both Euclidean and Riemannian spaces, thereby capturing spatio-temporal variations across distinct geometric domains. To alleviate the high computational cost of Riemannian distance, we further design an Adaptive-Distance-Bank (ADB) layer with a trainable memory mechanism. Finally, a Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (FGCN) is devised to integrate features from the dual spaces via a learnable fusion operator for accurate prediction. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that HSMGNN achieves up to a 13.8 percent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in forecasting accuracy.</p></details> |  |

These models extend traditional message-passing GNNs and Transformers by representing node and edge features as spherical tensors that transform under irreducible representations of the rotation group SO(3), ensuring that predictions change in physically meaningful ways under rotations of the input. This guide develops a complete, intuitive foundation for spherical equivariant modeling - from group representations and spherical harmonics, to tensor products, Clebsch-Gordan decomposition, and the construction of SO(3)-equivariant kernels. Building on this foundation, we construct the Tensor Field Network and SE(3)-Transformer architectures and explain how they perform equivariant message-passing and attention on geometric graphs. Through clear mathematical derivations and annotated code excerpts, this guide serves as a self-contained introduction for researchers and learners seeking to understand or implement spherical EGNNs for applications in chemistry, molecular property prediction, protein structure modeling, and generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is a technical version of the article originally published in Alchemy Bio (99 pages, 46 figures)</p></details> |

We propose a novel framework that integrates persistent homology features with stability regularization to enhance robustness. Building on the stability theorems of persistent homology \cite{cohen2007stability}, our method combines GIN architectures with multi-scale topological features extracted from persistence images, enforced by Hiraoka-Kusano-inspired stability constraints. Across six diverse datasets spanning biochemical, social, and collaboration networks , our approach demonstrates exceptional robustness to edge perturbations while maintaining competitive accuracy. Notably, we observe minimal performance degradation (0-4\% on most datasets) under perturbation, significantly outperforming baseline stability. Our work provides both a theoretically-grounded and empirically-validated approach to robust graph learning that aligns with recent advances in topological regularization</p></details> |  |

We introduce LightTopoGAT, a lightweight graph attention network that enhances node features through topological augmentation by incorporating node degree and local clustering coefficient to improve graph representation learning. The proposed approach maintains parameter efficiency through streamlined attention mechanisms while integrating structural information that is typically overlooked by local message passing schemes. Through comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, MUTAG, ENZYMES, and PROTEINS, we show that LightTopoGAT achieves superior performance compared to established baselines including GCN, GraphSAGE, and standard GAT, with a 6.6 percent improvement in accuracy on MUTAG and a 2.2 percent improvement on PROTEINS. Ablation studies further confirm that these performance gains arise directly from the inclusion of topological features, demonstrating a simple yet effective strategy for enhancing graph neural network performance without increasing architectural complexity.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[The prediction of the quality of results in Logic Synthesis using Transformer and Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11437v3)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the logic synthesis stage, structure transformations in the synthesis tool need to be combined into optimization sequences and act on the circuit to meet the specified circuit area and delay. However, logic synthesis optimization sequences are time-consuming to run, and predicting the quality of the results (QoR) against the synthesis optimization sequence for a circuit can help engineers find a better optimization sequence faster. In this work, we propose a deep learning method to predict the QoR of unseen circuit-optimization sequences pairs. Specifically, the structure transformations are translated into vectors by embedding methods and advanced natural language processing (NLP) technology (Transformer) is used to extract the features of the optimization sequences. In addition, to enable the prediction process of the model to be generalized from circuit to circuit, the graph representation of the circuit is represented as an adjacency matrix and a feature matrix. Graph neural networks(GNN) are used to extract the structural features of the circuits. For this problem, the Transformer and three typical GNNs are used. Furthermore, the Transformer and GNNs are adopted as a joint learning policy for the QoR prediction of the unseen circuit-optimization sequences. The methods resulting from the combination of Transformer and GNNs are benchmarked. The experimental results show that the joint learning of Transformer and GraphSage gives the best results. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the predicted result is 0.412.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta Pruning via Graph Metanetworks : A Universal Meta Learning Framework for Network Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12041v3)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an entirely new meta-learning framework for network pruning. It is a general framework that can be theoretically applied to almost all types of networks with all kinds of pruning and has great generality and transferability. Experiments have shown that it can achieve outstanding results on many popular and representative pruning tasks (including both CNNs and Transformers). Unlike all prior works that either rely on fixed, hand-crafted criteria to prune in a coarse manner, or employ learning to prune ways that require special training during each pruning and lack generality. Our framework can learn complex pruning rules automatically via a neural network (metanetwork) and has great generality that can prune without any special training. More specifically, we introduce the newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning strategy automatically and can transform a network that is hard to prune into another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained, our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and some standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yewei-Liu/MetaPruning</p></details> |  |

While forecasting models generally disregard unmonitored roads by design, spatial imputation methods explicitly address network-wide estimation; yet this approach relies on volume data at inference time, limiting its applicability in sensor-scarce cities. Unlike traffic volume data, probe vehicle speeds and static road attributes are more broadly accessible and support full coverage of road segments in most urban networks. In this work, we present the Hybrid Directed-Attention Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HDA-STGNN), an inductive deep learning framework designed to tackle the network-wide volume estimation problem. Our approach leverages speed profiles, static road attributes, and road network topology to predict daily traffic volume profiles across all road segments in the network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform extensive ablation studies that demonstrate the model's capacity to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies and highlight the value of topological information for accurate network-wide traffic volume estimation without relying on volume data at inference time.</p></details> |  |

We view an optimizer as a short program over a small vocabulary of search operators and learn this operator program separately for each problem instance. We instantiate this idea in Operator-Programmed Algorithms (OPAL), a landscape-aware framework for continuous black-box optimization that uses a small design budget with a standard differential evolution baseline to probe the landscape, builds a $k$-nearest neighbor graph over sampled points, and encodes this trajectory with a graph neural network. A meta-learner then maps the resulting representation to a phase-wise schedule of exploration, restart, and local search operators. On the CEC~2017 test suite, a single meta-trained OPAL policy is statistically competitive with state-of-the-art adaptive differential evolution variants and achieves significant improvements over simpler baselines under nonparametric tests. Ablation studies on CEC~2017 justify the choices for the design phase, the trajectory graph, and the operator-program representation, while the meta-components add only modest wall-clock overhead. Overall, the results indicate that operator-programmed, landscape-aware per-instance design is a practical way forward beyond ad hoc metaphor-based algorithms in black-box optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code, experiment scripts, and results are publicly available at https://github.com/junbolian/OPAL.

This work proposes a graph-based framework that models Urdu novels as character interaction networks to examine whether authorial style can be inferred from narrative structure alone. Each novel is represented as a graph where nodes correspond to characters and edges denote their co-occurrence within narrative proximity. We systematically compare multiple graph representations, including global structural features, node-level semantic summaries, unsupervised graph embeddings, and supervised graph neural networks. Experiments on a dataset of 52 Urdu novels written by seven authors show that learned graph representations substantially outperform hand-crafted and unsupervised baselines, achieving up to 0.857 accuracy under a strict author-aware evaluation protocol.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Yet, Hessians are computationally expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization, zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks.

In this paper, we present tgp's structure and present an extensive benchmark. The latter showcases the library's features and systematically compares the performance of the implemented graph-pooling methods in different downstream tasks. The results, showing that the choice of the optimal pooling operator depends on tasks and data at hand, support the need for a library that enables fast prototyping.</p></details> |  |

DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-Based Trust Evaluation Network) introduces a unified graph-based framework that does all three by combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To track how trust evolves, it layers hybrid absolute-Gaussian-hourglass positional encoding with Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, then applies an ordinary differential equation-based residual learning module to jointly model abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary cosine and Jaccard similarity, curbing reputation laundering, sabotage, and on-off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN delivers standout gains where it matters most: in single-timeslot prediction on Bitcoin-OTC, it improves MCC by +12.34% over the best dynamic baseline; in the cold-start scenario on Bitcoin-Alpha, it achieves a +25.00% MCC improvement, the largest across all tasks and datasets; while under adversarial on-off attacks, it surpasses the baseline by up to +10.23% MCC. These results endorse the unified DGTEN framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Using CEEMDAN, we extract nine IMFs spanning high-frequency fluctuations to long-term trends. Each IMF is transformed into a graph using four time-series-to-graph methods: natural visibility, horizontal visibility, recurrence, and transition graphs. Topological analysis shows clear scale-dependent structure: high-frequency IMFs yield dense, highly connected small-world graphs, whereas low-frequency IMFs produce sparser networks with longer characteristic path lengths. Visibility-based methods are more sensitive to amplitude variability and typically generate higher clustering, while recurrence graphs better preserve temporal dependencies. These results provide guidance for designing GNN architectures tailored to the structural properties of decomposed components, supporting more effective predictive modeling of financial time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We present Graph of Molecule Substructures (GoMS), a novel architecture that explicitly models the interactions and spatial arrangements between molecular substructures. Unlike ESAN's bag-based representation, GoMS constructs a graph where nodes represent subgraphs and edges capture their structural relationships, preserving critical topological information about how substructures are connected and overlap within the molecule. Through extensive experiments on public molecular datasets, we demonstrate that GoMS outperforms ESAN and other baseline methods, with particularly improvements for large molecules containing more than 100 atoms. The performance gap widens as molecular size increases, demonstrating GoMS's effectiveness for modeling industrial-scale molecules. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GoMS can distinguish molecules with identical subgraph compositions but different spatial arrangements. Our approach shows particular promise for materials science applications involving complex molecules where properties emerge from the interplay between multiple functional units. By capturing substructure relationships that are lost in bag-based approaches, GoMS represents a significant advance toward scalable and interpretable molecular property prediction for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stealthy Yet Effective: Distribution-Preserving Backdoor Attacks on Graph Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26032v2)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Existing tensor classification methods rely on sparsity or Tucker structures and often lack theoretical guarantees. Motivated by empirical evidence that discriminative signals concentrate along a few multilinear components, we introduce CP low-rank structure for the discriminant tensor, a modeling perspective not previously explored. Under a Tensor Gaussian Mixture Model, we propose high-dimensional CP low-rank Tensor Discriminant Analysis (CP-TDA) with Randomized Composite PCA (\textsc{rc-PCA}) initialization, that is essential for handling dependent and anisotropic noise under weaker signal strength and incoherence conditions, followed by iterative refinement algorithm. We establish global convergence and minimax-optimal misclassification rates. To handle tensor data deviating from tensor normality, we develop the first semiparametric tensor discriminant model, in which learned tensor representations are mapped via deep generative models into a latent space tailored for CP-TDA. Misclassification risk decomposes into representation, approximation, and estimation errors. Numerical studies and real data analysis on graph classification demonstrate substantial gains over existing tensor classifiers and state-of-the-art graph neural networks, particularly in high-dimensional, small-sample regimes.</p></details> |  |

Such behavior not only disrupts the order of the financial market but also harms economic and social development and breeds other illegal and criminal activities. With the popularization of the internet and online payment methods, many fraudulent activities and money laundering behaviors in life have shifted from offline to online, posing a great challenge to regulatory authorities. How to efficiently detect these financial fraud activities has become an urgent issue that needs to be resolved. Graph neural networks are a type of deep learning model that can utilize the interactive relationships within graph structures, and they have been widely applied in the field of fraud detection. However, there are still some issues. First, fraudulent activities only account for a very small part of transaction transfers, leading to an inevitable problem of label imbalance in fraud detection. At the same time, fraudsters often disguise their behavior, which can have a negative impact on the final prediction results. In addition, existing research has overlooked the importance of balancing neighbor information and central node information. For example, when the central node has too many neighbors, the features of the central node itself are often neglected. Finally, fraud activities and patterns are constantly changing over time, so considering the dynamic evolution of graph edge relationships is also very important.</p></details> | <details><summary>I req...</summary><p>I request the withdrawal of this paper because serious concerns have been identified regarding the originality of the manuscript, and the authors suspect that the fifth author may have engaged in plagiarism, including the possible use of unpublished results from a manuscript affiliated with Donghua University</p></details> |
| **[Generative Graph Pattern Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16130v3)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been predominantly driven by message-passing, where node representations are iteratively updated via local neighborhood aggregation. Despite their success, message-passing suffers from fundamental limitations -- including constrained expressiveness, over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited capacity to model long-range dependencies. These issues hinder scalability: increasing data size or model size often fails to yield improved performance. To this end, we explore pathways beyond message-passing and introduce Generative Graph Pattern Machine (G$^2$PM), a generative Transformer pre-training framework for graphs. G$^2$PM represents graph instances (nodes, edges, or entire graphs) as sequences of substructures, and employs generative pre-training over the sequences to learn generalizable and transferable representations. Empirically, G$^2$PM demonstrates strong scalability: on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark, it continues to improve with model sizes up to 60M parameters, outperforming prior generative approaches that plateau at significantly smaller scales (e.g., 3M). In addition, we systematically analyze the model design space, highlighting key architectural choices that contribute to its scalability and generalization. Across diverse tasks -- including node/link/graph classification, transfer learning, and cross-graph pretraining -- G$^2$PM consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing a compelling foundation for scalable graph learning.

The proposed system coordinates autonomous charging agents across networks of 250 EVs and 45 charging stations while adapting to dynamic environmental conditions through context-aware decision-making. Our multi-agent approach employs coordinated Deep Q\-Networks integrated with Graph Neural Networks and attention mechanisms, processing 20 contextual features including weather patterns, traffic conditions, grid load fluctuations, and electricity pricing.The framework balances five ecosystem stakeholders i.e. EV users (25\%), grid operators (20\%), charging station operators (20\%), fleet operators (20%), and environmental factors (15\%) through weighted coordination mechanisms and consensus protocols. Comprehensive validation using real-world datasets containing 441,077 charging transactions demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline algorithms including DDPG, A3C, PPO, and GNN approaches. The CAMAC\-DRA framework achieves 92\% coordination success rate, 15\% energy efficiency improvement, 10\% cost reduction, 20% grid strain decrease, and \2.3x faster convergence while maintaining 88\% training stability and 85\% sample efficiency. Real-world validation confirms commercial viability with Net Present Cost of -\$122,962 and 69\% cost reduction through renewable energy integration. The framework's unique contribution lies in developing context-aware multi-stakeholder coordination that successfully balances competing objectives while adapting to real-time variables, positioning it as a breakthrough solution for intelligent EV charging coordination and sustainable transportation electrification.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents Hash based Multi-phase SpGEMM on GPU and the Acceleration of Indirect Memory Access (AIA) technique, a novel custom near-memory processing approach to optimizing SpGEMM on GPU HBM. Our hardware-software co-designed framework for SpGEMM demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling complex, application-specific workloads. We evaluate our approach on various graph workloads, including graph contraction, Markov clustering, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), showcasing its practical applicability. For graph analytics applications, AIA demonstrates up to 17.3% time reduction from the software-only implementation, while achieving time reduction of 76.5% for Graph Contraction and 58.4% for Markov Clustering compared to cuSPARSE. For GNN training applications with structured global pruning, our hybrid approach delivers an average of 1.43x speedup over software-only implementation across six benchmark datasets and three architectures (GCN, GIN, GraphSAGE), and shows 1.95x speedup for GNN workloads when compared to cuSPARSE, with up to 4.18x gains on large-scale datasets.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

A mmWave radar point cloud-based HAR system suffers from sparsity and variable-size problems due to the physical features of the mmWave signal. Existing works usually borrow the preprocessing algorithms for the vision-based systems with dense point clouds, which may not be optimal for mmWave radar systems. In this work, we proposed a graph representation with a discrete dynamic graph neural network (DDGNN) to explore the spatial-temporal representation of human movement-related features. Specifically, we designed a star graph to describe the high-dimensional relative relationship between a manually added static center point and the dynamic mmWave radar points in the same and consecutive frames. We then adopted DDGNN to learn the features residing in the star graph with variable sizes. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach outperformed other baseline methods using real-world HAR datasets. Our system achieved an overall classification accuracy of 94.27\%, which gets the near-optimal performance with a vision-based skeleton data accuracy of 97.25\%. We also conducted an inference test on Raspberry Pi~4 to demonstrate its effectiveness on resource-constraint platforms. \sh{ We provided a comprehensive ablation study for variable DDGNN structures to validate our model design. Our system also outperformed three recent radar-specific methods without requiring resampling or frame aggregators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Data and Physics: A Graph Neural Network-Based Hybrid Twin Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15767v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating complex unsteady physical phenomena relies on detailed mathematical models, simulated for instance by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, these models often exhibit discrepancies from the reality due to unmodeled effects or simplifying assumptions. We refer to this gap as the ignorance model. While purely data-driven approaches attempt to learn full system behavior, they require large amounts of high-quality data across the entire spatial and temporal domain. In real-world scenarios, such information is unavailable, making full data-driven modeling unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we model of the ignorance component using a hybrid twin approach, instead of simulating phenomena from scratch. Since physics-based models approximate the overall behavior of the phenomena, the remaining ignorance is typically lower in complexity than the full physical response, therefore, it can be learned with significantly fewer data. A key difficulty, however, is that spatial measurements are sparse, also obtaining data measuring the same phenomenon for different spatial configurations is challenging in practice. Our contribution is to overcome this limitation by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the ignorance model. GNNs learn the spatial pattern of the missing physics even when the number of measurement locations is limited. This allows us to enrich the physics-based model with data-driven corrections without requiring dense spatial, temporal and parametric data. To showcase the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate this GNN-based hybrid twin on nonlinear heat transfer problems across different meshes, geometries, and load positions. Results show that the GNN successfully captures the ignorance and generalizes corrections across spatial configurations, improving simulation accuracy and interpretability, while minimizing data requirements.</p></details> | 27 pages, 14 figures |

To support more sustainable workflows, we present Text2Graph, an open-source Python package that provides a modular implementation of existing text-to-graph classification approaches. The framework enables users to combine LLM-based partial annotation with Graph Neural Network (GNN) label propagation in a flexible manner, making it straightforward to swap components such as feature extractors, edge construction methods, and sampling strategies. We benchmark Text2Graph on a zero-shot setting using five datasets spanning topic classification and sentiment analysis tasks, comparing multiple variants against other zero-shot approaches for text classification. In addition to reporting performance, we provide detailed estimates of energy consumption and carbon emissions, showing that graph-based propagation achieves competitive results at a fraction of the energy and environmental cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Embedding with Mel-spectrograms for Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11545v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater acoustic target recognition (UATR) is extremely challenging due to the complexity of ship-radiated noise and the variability of ocean environments. Although deep learning (DL) approaches have achieved promising results, most existing models implicitly assume that underwater acoustic data lie in a Euclidean space. This assumption, however, is unsuitable for the inherently complex topology of underwater acoustic signals, which exhibit non-stationary, non-Gaussian, and nonlinear characteristics. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the UATR-GTransformer, a non-Euclidean DL model that integrates Transformer architectures with graph neural networks (GNNs). The model comprises three key components: a Mel patchify block, a GTransformer block, and a classification head. The Mel patchify block partitions the Mel-spectrogram into overlapping patches, while the GTransformer block employs a Transformer Encoder to capture mutual information between split patches to generate Mel-graph embeddings. Subsequently, a GNN enhances these embeddings by modeling local neighborhood relationships, and a feed-forward network (FFN) further performs feature transformation. Experiments results based on two widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the UATR-GTransformer achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods. In addition, interpretability analysis reveals that the proposed model effectively extracts rich frequency-domain information, highlighting its potential for applications in ocean engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAT: Can Trust be Predicted with Context-Awareness in Dynamic Heterogeneous Networks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11352v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trust prediction provides valuable support for decision-making, risk mitigation, and system security enhancement. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for trust prediction, owing to their ability to learn expressive node representations that capture intricate trust relationships within a network. However, current GNN-based trust prediction models face several limitations: (i) Most of them fail to capture trust dynamicity, leading to questionable inferences. (ii) They rarely consider the heterogeneous nature of real-world networks, resulting in a loss of rich semantics. (iii) None of them support context-awareness, a basic property of trust, making prediction results coarse-grained. To this end, we propose CAT, the first Context-Aware GNN-based Trust prediction model that supports trust dynamicity and accurately represents real-world heterogeneity. CAT consists of a graph construction layer, an embedding layer, a heterogeneous attention layer, and a prediction layer. It handles dynamic graphs using continuous-time representations and captures temporal information through a time encoding function. To model graph heterogeneity and leverage semantic information, CAT employs a dual attention mechanism that identifies the importance of different node types and nodes within each type. For context-awareness, we introduce a new notion of meta-paths to extract contextual features. By constructing context embeddings and integrating a context-aware aggregator, CAT can predict both context-aware trust and overall trust. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CAT outperforms five groups of baselines in trust prediction, while exhibiting strong scalability to large-scale graphs and robustness against both trust-oriented and GNN-oriented attacks.</p></details> |  |

While continual learning has been extended to dynamic graphs, existing methods overlook the effects of topological changes on existing nodes. To address it, we propose a novel framework for continual learning on dynamic graphs, named Condensation-Concatenation-based Continual Learning (CCC). Specifically, CCC first condenses historical graph snapshots into compact semantic representations while aiming to preserve the original label distribution and topological properties. Then it concatenates these historical embeddings with current graph representations selectively. Moreover, we refine the forgetting measure (FM) to better adapt to dynamic graph scenarios by quantifying the predictive performance degradation of existing nodes caused by structural updates. CCC demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines across four real-world datasets in extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |

Here we introduce AGAPI (AtomGPT.org API), an open-access agentic AI platform that integrates more than eight open-source LLMs with over twenty materials-science API endpoints, unifying databases, simulation tools, and machine-learning models through a common orchestration framework.

While machine-learning-based methods have shown some promise, many still rely on rule-based preprocessing designed by domain experts. Rule-based preprocessing methods often discard crucial context from the source code, potentially causing certain vulnerabilities to be overlooked and limiting adaptability to newly emerging threats. We introduce BugSweeper, an end-to-end deep learning framework that detects vulnerabilities directly from the source code without manual engineering. BugSweeper represents each Solidity function as a Function-Level Abstract Syntax Graph (FLAG), a novel graph that combines its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with enriched control-flow and data-flow semantics. Then, our two-stage Graph Neural Network (GNN) analyzes these graphs. The first-stage GNN filters noise from the syntax graphs, while the second-stage GNN conducts high-level reasoning to detect diverse vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on real-world contracts show that BugSweeper significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art detection methods. By removing the need for handcrafted rules, our approach offers a robust, automated, and scalable solution for securing smart contracts without any dependence on security experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, this practice often raises concerns about fairness at both the individual and group levels. At the individual level, a customer may perceive unfair treatment if he/she notices being charged a higher price than others. At the group level, pricing disparities can result in discrimination against certain protected groups, such as those defined by gender or race. Existing studies on fair pricing typically address individual and group fairness separately. This paper bridges the gap by introducing a new formulation of the personalized pricing problem that incorporates both dimensions of fairness in social network settings. To solve the problem, we propose FairPricing, a novel framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs) that learns a personalized pricing policy using customer features and network topology. In FairPricing, individual perceived unfairness is captured through a penalty on customer demand, and thus the profit objective, while group-level discrimination is mitigated using adversarial debiasing and a price regularization term. Unlike existing optimization-based personalized pricing, which requires re-optimization whenever the network updates, the pricing policy learned by FairPricing assigns personalized prices to all customers in an updated network based on their features and the new network structure, thereby generalizing to network changes. Extensive experimental results show that FairPricing achieves high profitability while improving individual fairness perceptions and satisfying group fairness requirements.</p></details> |  |

Mini-batch training is commonly used to train GNNs on large graphs, and data parallelism is the standard approach to scale mini-batch training across multiple GPUs. Data parallel approaches contain redundant work as subgraphs sampled by different GPUs contain significant overlap. To address this issue, we introduce a hybrid parallel mini-batch training paradigm called split parallelism. Split parallelism avoids redundant work by splitting the sampling, loading, and training of each mini-batch across multiple GPUs. Split parallelism, however, introduces communication overheads that can be more than the savings from removing redundant work. We further present a lightweight partitioning algorithm that probabilistically minimizes these overheads. We implement split parallelism in GSplit and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art mini-batch training systems like DGL, Quiver, and $P^3$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at MLSys 2025.

| **[Refining Graphical Neural Network Predictions Using Flow Matching for Optimal Power Flow with Constraint-Satisfaction Guarantee](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11127v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) problem is fundamental to power system operations, requiring rapid solutions for real-time grid management. While traditional optimization solvers provide optimal solutions, their computational cost becomes prohibitive for large-scale systems requiring frequent recalculations. Machine learning approaches offer promise for acceleration but often struggle with constraint satisfaction and cost optimality. We present a novel two-stage learning framework that combines physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Continuous Flow Matching (CFM) for solving DC-OPF problems. Our approach embeds fundamental physical principles--including economic dispatch optimality conditions, Kirchhoff's laws, and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) complementarity conditions--directly into the training objectives. The first stage trains a GNN to produce feasible initial solutions by learning from physics-informed losses that encode power system constraints. The second stage employs CFM, a simulation-free continuous normalizing flow technique, to refine these solutions toward optimality through learned vector field regression. Evaluated on the IEEE 30-bus system across five load scenarios ranging from 70\% to 130\% nominal load, our method achieves near-optimal solutions with cost gaps below 0.1\% for nominal loads and below 3\% for extreme conditions, while maintaining 100\% feasibility. Our framework bridges the gap between fast but approximate neural network predictions and optimal but slow numerical solvers, offering a practical solution for modern power systems with high renewable penetration requiring frequent dispatch updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering GNNs for Domain Adaptation via Denoising Target Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06236v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the node classification task in the context of graph domain adaptation, which uses both source and target graph structures along with source labels to enhance the generalization capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on target graphs. Structure domain shifts frequently occur, especially when graph data are collected at different times or from varying areas, resulting in poor performance of GNNs on target graphs. Surprisingly, we find that simply incorporating an auxiliary loss function for denoising graph edges on target graphs can be extremely effective in enhancing GNN performance on target graphs. Based on this insight, we propose our framework, GraphDeT, a framework that integrates this auxiliary edge task into GNN training for node classification under domain adaptation. Our theoretical analysis connects this auxiliary edge task to the graph generalization bound with -distance, demonstrating such auxiliary task can imposes a constraint which tightens the bound and thereby improves generalization. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to the existing baselines in handling both time and regional domain graph shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[LGAN: An Efficient High-Order Graph Neural Network via the Line Graph Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10735v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant paradigm for graph classification. Specifically, most existing GNNs mainly rely on the message passing strategy between neighbor nodes, where the expressivity is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Although a number of k-WL-based GNNs have been proposed to overcome this limitation, their computational cost increases rapidly with k, significantly restricting the practical applicability. Moreover, since the k-WL models mainly operate on node tuples, these k-WL-based GNNs cannot retain fine-grained node- or edge-level semantics required by attribution methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients), leading to the less interpretable problem. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN), that constructs a line graph from the induced subgraph centered at each node to perform the higher-order aggregation. We theoretically prove that the LGAN not only possesses the greater expressive power than the 2-WL under injective aggregation assumptions, but also has lower time complexity. Empirical evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate that the LGAN outperforms state-of-the-art k-WL-based GNNs, while offering better interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Formula size game and model checking for modal substitution calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07966v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has applied modal substitution calculus (MSC) and its variants to characterize various computational frameworks such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and distributed computing systems. For example, it has been shown that the expressive power of recurrent graph neural networks coincides with graded modal substitution calculus GMSC, which is the extension of MSC with counting modalities. GMSC can be further extended with the counting global modality, resulting in the logic GGMSC which corresponds to GNNs with global readout mechanisms. In this paper we introduce a formula-size game that characterizes the expressive power of MSC, GMSC, GGMSC, and related logics. Furthermore, we study the expressiveness and model checking of logics in this family. We prove that MSC and its extensions (GMSC, GGMSC) are as expressive as linear tape-bounded Turing machines, while asynchronous variants are linked to modal mu-calculus and modal computation logic MCL. We establish that for MSC, GMSC and GGMSC, both combined and data complexity of model checking are PSPACE-complete, and for their asynchronous variants, both complexities are PTIME-complete. We also establish that for the propositional fragment SC of MSC, the combined complexity of model checking is PSPACE-complete, while for asynchronous SC it is PTIME-complete, and in both cases, data complexity is constant. As a corollary, we observe that SC satisfiability is PSPACE-complete and NP-complete for its asynchronous variant. Finally, we construct a universal reduction from all recursively enumerable problems to MSC model checking.</p></details> |  |

However, HGNNs often suffer from type information loss and structural noise, limiting their representational fidelity and generalization. We propose THeGAU, a model-agnostic framework that combines a type-aware graph autoencoder with guided graph augmentation to improve node classification. THeGAU reconstructs schema-valid edges as an auxiliary task to preserve node-type semantics and introduces a decoder-driven augmentation mechanism to selectively refine noisy structures. This joint design enhances robustness, accuracy, and efficiency while significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three benchmark HIN datasets (IMDB, ACM, and DBLP) demonstrate that THeGAU consistently outperforms existing HGNN methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple backbones.</p></details> |  |

The challenging matching problem between robots and visual detection renders existing methods highly dependent on identity-encoded hardware or delicate tuning algorithms. Overconfident yet erroneous matches may bring about irreversible damage to the localization system. To address this issue, we introduce Mr. Virgil, an end-to-end learning multi-robot visual-range relative localization framework, consisting of a graph neural network for data association between UWB rangings and visual detections, and a differentiable pose graph optimization (PGO) back-end. The graph-based front-end supplies robust matching results, accurate initial position predictions, and credible uncertainty estimates, which are subsequently integrated into the PGO back-end to elevate the accuracy of the final pose estimation.

Recent work suggests that both graph neural network (GNN)-based and transformer-based models, including large language models (LLMs), yield promising results when evaluated on curated benchmark datasets. These datasets are typically characterized by consistent data distributions and heuristic or partially noisy labels. In this study, we systematically evaluate two representative DL models-ReVeal and LineVul-across four representative datasets: Juliet, Devign, BigVul, and ICVul. Each model is trained independently on each respective dataset, and their code representations are analyzed using t-SNE to uncover vulnerability related patterns. To assess realistic applicability, we deploy these models along with four pretrained LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-o3-mini, GPT-4o, and GPT-5 on a curated dataset, VentiVul, comprising 20 recently (May 2025) fixed vulnerabilities from the Linux kernel. Our experiments reveal that current models struggle to distinguish vulnerable from non-vulnerable code in representation space and generalize poorly across datasets with differing distributions. When evaluated on VentiVul, our newly constructed time-wise out-of-distribution dataset, performance drops sharply, with most models failing to detect vulnerabilities reliably. These results expose a persistent gap between academic benchmarks and real-world deployment, emphasizing the value of our deployment-oriented evaluation framework and the need for more robust code representations and higher-quality datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDFI: Diverse and Distribution-aware Missing Feature Imputation via Two-step Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06356v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incomplete node features are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios, e.g., the attributes of web users may be partly private, which causes the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to decline significantly. Feature propagation (FP) is a well-known method that performs well for imputation of missing node features on graphs, but it still has the following three issues: 1) it struggles with graphs that are not fully connected, 2) imputed features face the over-smoothing problem, and 3) FP is tailored for transductive tasks, overlooking the feature distribution shift in inductive tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce DDFI, a Diverse and Distribution-aware Missing Feature Imputation method that combines feature propagation with a graph-based Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) in a nontrivial manner. It first designs a simple yet effective algorithm, namely Co-Label Linking (CLL), that randomly connects nodes in the training set with the same label to enhance the performance on graphs with numerous connected components. Then we develop a novel two-step representation generation process at the inference stage. Specifically, instead of directly using FP-imputed features as input during inference, DDFI further reconstructs the features through the whole MAE to reduce feature distribution shift in the inductive tasks and enhance the diversity of node features. Meanwhile, since existing feature imputation methods for graphs only evaluate by simulating the missing scenes with manually masking the features, we collect a new dataset called Sailing from the records of voyages that contains naturally missing features to help better evaluate the effectiveness. Extensive experiments conducted on six public datasets and Sailing show that DDFI outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under both transductive and inductive settings.</p></details> |  |

Spatial cluster identification and analysis of these point clouds are crucial for extracting insights about molecular organization. However, this task becomes challenging in the presence of localization noise, high point density, or complex biological structures. Here, we introduce MIRO (Multifunctional Integration through Relational Optimization), an algorithm that uses recurrent graph neural networks to transform the point clouds in order to improve clustering efficiency when applying conventional clustering techniques. We show that MIRO supports simultaneous processing of clusters of different shapes and at multiple scales, demonstrating improved performance across varied datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates MIRO's transformative potential for single-molecule localization applications, showcasing its capability to revolutionize cluster analysis and provide accurate, reliable details of molecular architecture. In addition, MIRO's robust clustering capabilities hold promise for applications in various fields such as neuroscience, for the analysis of neural connectivity patterns, and environmental science, for studying spatial distributions of ecological data.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 5 main figures, 3 table, 3 supplementary figures, 9 supplementary tables.

| **[Better Prevent than Tackle: Valuing Defense in Soccer Based on Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10355v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating defensive performance in soccer remains challenging, as effective defending is often expressed not through visible on-ball actions such as interceptions and tackles, but through preventing dangerous opportunities before they arise. Existing approaches have largely focused on valuing on-ball actions, leaving much of defenders' true impact unmeasured. To address this gap, we propose DEFCON (DEFensive CONtribution evaluator), a comprehensive framework that quantifies player-level defensive contributions for every attacking situation in soccer. Leveraging Graph Attention Networks, DEFCON estimates the success probability and expected value of each attacking option, along with each defender's responsibility for stopping it. These components yield an Expected Possession Value (EPV) for the attacking team before and after each action, and DEFCON assigns positive or negative credits to defenders according to whether they reduced or increased the opponent's EPV. Trained on 2023-24 and evaluated on 2024-25 Eredivisie event and tracking data, DEFCON's aggregated player credits exhibit strong positive correlations with market valuations. Finally, we showcase several practical applications, including in-game timelines of defensive contributions, spatial analyses across pitch zones, and pairwise summaries of attacker-defender interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Kernel-based Resource-efficient Neural Surrogate for Multi-fidelity Prediction of Aerodynamic Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10287v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surrogate models provide fast alternatives to costly aerodynamic simulations and are extremely useful in design and optimization applications. This study proposes the use of a recent kernel-based neural surrogate, KHRONOS. In this work, we blend sparse high-fidelity (HF) data with low-fidelity (LF) information to predict aerodynamic fields under varying constraints in computational resources. Unlike traditional approaches, KHRONOS is built upon variational principles, interpolation theory, and tensor decomposition. These elements provide a mathematical basis for heavy pruning compared to dense neural networks. Using the AirfRANS dataset as a high-fidelity benchmark and NeuralFoil to generate low-fidelity counterparts, this work compares the performance of KHRONOS with three contemporary model architectures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a graph neural network (GNN), and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). We consider varying levels of high-fidelity data availability (0%, 10%, and 30%) and increasingly complex geometry parameterizations. These are used to predict the surface pressure coefficient distribution over the airfoil. Results indicate that, whilst all models eventually achieve comparable predictive accuracy, KHRONOS excels in resource-constrained conditions. In this domain, KHRONOS consistently requires orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and delivers much faster training and inference than contemporary dense neural networks at comparable accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of KHRONOS and similar architectures to balance accuracy and efficiency in multi-fidelity aerodynamic field prediction.</p></details> | 24 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Graph Neural Network Based Adaptive Threat Detection for Cloud Identity and Access Management Logs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10280v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of cloud infrastructures and distributed identity systems has significantly increased the complexity and attack surface of modern enterprises. Traditional rule based or signature driven detection systems are often inadequate in identifying novel or evolving threats within Identity and Access Management logs, where anomalous behavior may appear statistically benign but contextually malicious. This paper presents a Graph Neural Network Based Adaptive Threat Detection framework designed to learn latent user resource interaction patterns from IAM audit trails in real time. By modeling IAM logs as heterogeneous dynamic graphs, the proposed system captures temporal, relational, and contextual dependencies across entities such as users, roles, sessions, and access actions. The model incorporates attention based aggregation and graph embedding updates to enable continual adaptation to changing cloud environments. Experimental evaluation on synthesized and real world IAM datasets demonstrates that the proposed method achieves higher detection precision and recall than baseline LSTM and GCN classifiers, while maintaining scalability across multi tenant cloud environments. The frameworks adaptability enables proactive mitigation of insider threats, privilege escalation, and lateral movement attacks, contributing to the foundation of AI driven zero trust access analytics. This work bridges the gap between graph based machine learning and operational cloud security intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[GFM-RAG: Graph Foundation Model for Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01113v3)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, conventional RAGs struggle to capture complex relationships between pieces of knowledge, limiting their performance in intricate reasoning that requires integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Recently, graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) builds graph structure to explicitly model these relationships, enabling more effective and efficient retrievers. Nevertheless, its performance is still hindered by the noise and incompleteness within the graph structure. To address this, we introduce GFM-RAG, a novel graph foundation model (GFM) for retrieval augmented generation. GFM-RAG is powered by an innovative graph neural network that reasons over graph structure to capture complex query-knowledge relationships. The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage training process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with over 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and generalizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model applicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific RAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws, highlighting its potential for further improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Exact Subgraph Matching via GNN-based Path Dominance Embedding (Technical Report)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15641v6)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classic problem of exact subgraph matching returns those subgraphs in a large-scale data graph that are isomorphic to a given query graph, which has gained increasing importance in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective graph neural network (GNN)-based path embedding framework (GNN-PE), which allows efficient exact subgraph matching without introducing false dismissals. Unlike traditional GNN-based graph embeddings that only produce approximate subgraph matching results, in this paper, we carefully devise GNN-based embeddings for paths, such that: if two paths (and 1-hop neighbors of vertices on them) have the subgraph relationship, their corresponding GNN-based embedding vectors will strictly follow the dominance relationship. With such a newly designed property of path dominance embeddings, we are able to propose effective pruning strategies based on path label/dominance embeddings and guarantee no false dismissals for subgraph matching. We build multidimensional indexes over path embedding vectors, and develop an efficient subgraph matching algorithm by traversing indexes over graph partitions in parallel and applying our pruning methods. We also propose a cost-model-based query plan that obtains query paths from the query graph with low query cost. To further optimize our GNN-PE approach, we also propose a more efficient GNN-based path group embedding (GNN-PGE) technique, which performs subgraph matching over grouped path embedding vectors. We design effective pruning strategies (w.r.t. grouped path embeddings) that can significantly reduce the search space during the index traversal. Through extensive experiments, we confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed GNN-PE and GNN-PGE approaches for exact subgraph matching on both real and synthetic graph data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06696v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained equivariant graph neural networks based on spherical harmonics offer efficient and accurate alternatives to computationally expensive ab-initio methods, yet adapting them to new tasks and chemical environments still requires fine-tuning. Conventional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Adapters and LoRA, typically break symmetry, making them incompatible with those equivariant architectures. ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis. We demonstrate that MMEA preserves strict equivariance and, across multiple benchmarks, consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels while training fewer parameters than competing approaches. These results suggest that, in many practical scenarios, modulating channel magnitudes is sufficient to adapt equivariant models to new chemical environments without breaking symmetry, pointing toward a new paradigm for equivariant PEFT design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026 (Poster)</p></details> |
| **[Galaxy Phase-Space and Field-Level Cosmology: The Strength of Semi-Analytic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10222v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-analytic models are a widely used approach to simulate galaxy properties within a cosmological framework, relying on simplified yet physically motivated prescriptions. They have also proven to be an efficient alternative for generating accurate galaxy catalogs, offering a faster and less computationally expensive option compared to full hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that using only galaxy $3$D positions and radial velocities, we can train a graph neural network coupled to a moment neural network to obtain a robust machine learning based model capable of estimating the matter density parameters, $Ω_{\rm m}$, with a precision of approximately 10%. The network is trained on ($25 h^{-1}$Mpc)$^3$ volumes of galaxy catalogs from L-Galaxies and can successfully extrapolate its predictions to other semi-analytic models (GAEA, SC-SAM, and Shark) and, more remarkably, to hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, and SWIFT-EAGLE). Our results show that the network is robust to variations in astrophysical and subgrid physics, cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and the different halo-profile treatments used across simulations. This suggests that the physical relationships encoded in the phase-space of semi-analytic models are largely independent of their specific physical prescriptions, reinforcing their potential as tools for the generation of realistic mock catalogs for cosmological parameter inference.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Modeling Narrative Archetypes in Conspiratorial Narratives: Insights from Singapore-Based Telegram Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10105v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conspiratorial discourse is increasingly embedded within digital communication ecosystems, yet its structure and spread remain difficult to study. This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features. Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[M3Net: A Multi-Metric Mixture of Experts Network Digital Twin with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09797v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of 5G/6G network technologies promises to enable applications like autonomous vehicles and virtual reality, resulting in a significant increase in connected devices and necessarily complicating network management. Even worse, these applications often have strict, yet heterogeneous, performance requirements across metrics like latency and reliability. Much recent work has thus focused on developing the ability to predict network performance. However, traditional methods for network modeling, like discrete event simulators and emulation, often fail to balance accuracy and scalability. Network Digital Twins (NDTs), augmented by machine learning, present a viable solution by creating virtual replicas of physical networks for real- time simulation and analysis. State-of-the-art models, however, fall short of full-fledged NDTs, as they often focus only on a single performance metric or simulated network data. We introduce M3Net, a Multi-Metric Mixture-of-experts (MoE) NDT that uses a graph neural network architecture to estimate multiple performance metrics from an expanded set of network state data in a range of scenarios. We show that M3Net significantly enhances the accuracy of flow delay predictions by reducing the MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) from 20.06% to 17.39%, while also achieving 66.47% and 78.7% accuracy on jitter and packets dropped for each flow</p></details> |  |
| **[A Network Science Approach to Granular Time Series Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17640v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series segmentation (TSS) is one of the time series (TS) analysis techniques, that has received considerably less attention compared to other TS related tasks. In recent years, deep learning architectures have been introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of various TS-to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d) demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1 score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the required training data compared to the baseline methods.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Graph-Based Bayesian Optimization for Quantum Circuit Architecture Search with Uncertainty Calibrated Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09586v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum circuit design is a key bottleneck for practical quantum machine learning on complex, real-world data. We present an automated framework that discovers and refines variational quantum circuits (VQCs) using graph-based Bayesian optimization with a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate. Circuits are represented as graphs and mutated and selected via an expected improvement acquisition function informed by surrogate uncertainty with Monte Carlo dropout. Candidate circuits are evaluated with a hybrid quantum-classical variational classifier on the next generation firewall telemetry and network internet of things (NF-ToN-IoT-V2) cybersecurity dataset, after feature selection and scaling for quantum embedding. We benchmark our pipeline against an MLP-based surrogate, random search, and greedy GNN selection. The GNN-guided optimizer consistently finds circuits with lower complexity and competitive or superior classification accuracy compared to all baselines. Robustness is assessed via a noise study across standard quantum noise channels, including amplitude damping, phase damping, thermal relaxation, depolarizing, and readout bit flip noise. The implementation is fully reproducible, with time benchmarking and export of best found circuits, providing a scalable and interpretable route to automated quantum circuit discovery.</p></details> | 17 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Transport Novelty Distance: A Distributional Metric for Evaluating Material Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09514v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative machine learning have opened new possibilities for the discovery and design of novel materials. However, as these models become more sophisticated, the need for rigorous and meaningful evaluation metrics has grown. Existing evaluation approaches often fail to capture both the quality and novelty of generated structures, limiting our ability to assess true generative performance. In this paper, we introduce the Transport Novelty Distance (TNovD) to judge generative models used for materials discovery jointly by the quality and novelty of the generated materials. Based on ideas from Optimal Transport theory, TNovD uses a coupling between the features of the training and generated sets, which is refined into a quality and memorization regime by a threshold. The features are generated from crystal structures using a graph neural network that is trained to distinguish between materials, their augmented counterparts, and differently sized supercells using contrastive learning. We evaluate our proposed metric on typical toy experiments relevant for crystal structure prediction, including memorization, noise injection and lattice deformations. Additionally, we validate the TNovD on the MP20 validation set and the WBM substitution dataset, demonstrating that it is capable of detecting both memorized and low-quality material data. We also benchmark the performance of several popular material generative models. While introduced for materials, our TNovD framework is domain-agnostic and can be adapted for other areas, such as images and molecules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Text Classification with Large Language Models and Neural Attention Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09444v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes a text classification algorithm based on large language models, aiming to address the limitations of traditional methods in capturing long-range dependencies, understanding contextual semantics, and handling class imbalance. The framework includes text encoding, contextual representation modeling, attention-based enhancement, feature aggregation, and classification prediction. In the representation stage, deep semantic embeddings are obtained through large-scale pretrained language models, and attention mechanisms are applied to enhance the selective representation of key features. In the aggregation stage, global and weighted strategies are combined to generate robust text-level vectors. In the classification stage, a fully connected layer and Softmax output are used to predict class distributions, and cross-entropy loss is employed to optimize model parameters. Comparative experiments introduce multiple baseline models, including recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and Transformers, and evaluate them on Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing models on all metrics, with especially strong improvements in Recall and AUC. In addition, sensitivity experiments are conducted on hyperparameters and data conditions, covering the impact of hidden dimensions on AUC and the impact of class imbalance ratios on Recall. The findings demonstrate that proper model configuration has a significant effect on performance and reveal the adaptability and stability of the model under different conditions. Overall, the proposed text classification method not only achieves effective performance improvement but also verifies its robustness and applicability in complex data environments through systematic analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Do Graph Signals Affect Recommendation: Unveiling the Mystery of Low and High-Frequency Graph Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15744v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) are highly effective in modeling graph signals, with their success in recommendation often attributed to low-pass filtering. However, recent studies highlight the importance of high-frequency signals. The role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation remains unclear. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the influence of graph signals on recommendation performance. We theoretically prove that the effects of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals are equivalent in recommendation tasks, as both contribute by smoothing the similarities between user-item pairs. To leverage this insight, we propose a frequency signal scaler, a plug-and-play module that adjusts the graph signal filter function to fine-tune the smoothness between user-item pairs, making it compatible with any GNN model. Additionally, we identify and prove that graph embedding-based methods cannot fully capture the characteristics of graph signals. To address this limitation, a space flip method is introduced to restore the expressive power of graph embeddings. Remarkably, we demonstrate that either low-frequency or high-frequency graph signals alone are sufficient for effective recommendations. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/mojosey/SimGCF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Branching Strategies Based on Subgraph GNNs: A Study on Theoretical Promise versus Practical Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09355v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for ``learning to branch'' in Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). While standard Message-Passing GNNs (MPNNs) are efficient, they theoretically lack the expressive power to fully represent MILP structures. Conversely, higher-order GNNs (like 2-FGNNs) are expressive but computationally prohibitive. In this work, we investigate Subgraph GNNs as a theoretical middle ground. Crucially, while previous work [Chen et al., 2025] demonstrated that GNNs with 3-WL expressive power can approximate Strong Branching, we prove a sharper result: node-anchored Subgraph GNNs whose expressive power is strictly lower than 3-WL [Zhang et al., 2023] are sufficient to approximate Strong Branching scores. However, our extensive empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets reveals a stark contrast between theory and practice. While node-anchored Subgraph GNNs theoretically offer superior branching decisions, their $O(n)$ complexity overhead results in significant memory bottlenecks and slower solving times than MPNNs and heuristics. Our results indicate that for MILP branching, the computational cost of expressive GNNs currently outweighs their gains in decision quality, suggesting that future research must focus on efficiency-preserving expressivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Failure Modes of Transformers through the Lens of Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09182v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers and more specifically decoder-only transformers dominate modern LLM architectures. While they have shown to work exceptionally well, they are not without issues, resulting in surprising failure modes and predictably asymmetric performance degradation. This article is a study of many of these observed failure modes of transformers through the lens of graph neural network (GNN) theory. We first make the case that much of deep learning, including transformers, is about learnable information mixing and propagation. This makes the study of model failure modes a study of bottlenecks in information propagation. This naturally leads to GNN theory, where there is already a rich literature on information propagation bottlenecks and theoretical failure modes of models. We then make the case that many issues faced by GNNs are also experienced by transformers. In addition, we analyze how the causal nature of decoder-only transformers create interesting geometric properties in information propagation, resulting in predictable and potentially devastating failure modes. Finally, we observe that existing solutions in transformer research tend to be ad-hoc and driven by intuition rather than grounded theoretical motivation. As such, we unify many such solutions under a more theoretical perspective, providing insight into why they work, what problem they are actually solving, and how they can be further improved to target specific failure modes of transformers. Overall, this article is an attempt to bridge the gap between observed failure modes in transformers and a general lack of theoretical understanding of them in this space.</p></details> |  |

By combining the Matra-Genoa generative model, Orb-v2 universal machine learning interatomic potential, and ALIGNN graph neural network for energy prediction, we generated 119 million candidate structures and added 1.3 million DFT-validated compounds to the ALEXANDRIA database, including 74 thousand new stable materials. The expanded ALEXANDRIA database now contains 5.8 million structures with 175 thousand compounds on the convex hull. Predicted structural disorder rates (37-43%) match experimental databases, unlike other recent AI-generated datasets. Analysis reveals fundamental patterns in space group distributions, coordination environments, and phase stability networks, including sub-linear scaling of convex hull connectivity. We release the complete dataset, including sAlex25 with 14 million out-of-equilibrium structures containing forces and stresses for training universal force fields. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a GRACE model on this data improves benchmark accuracy. All data, models, and workflows are freely available under Creative Commons licenses.</p></details> |  |
