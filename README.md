Existing approaches, such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1, the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools. Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.</p></details> |  |
| **[Residual MPC: Blending Reinforcement Learning with GPU-Parallelized Model Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12717v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC) provides interpretable, tunable locomotion controllers grounded in physical models, but its robustness depends on frequent replanning and is limited by model mismatch and real-time computational constraints. Reinforcement Learning (RL), by contrast, can produce highly robust behaviors through stochastic training but often lacks interpretability, suffers from out-of-distribution failures, and requires intensive reward engineering. This work presents a GPU-parallelized residual architecture that tightly integrates MPC and RL by blending their outputs at the torque-control level. We develop a kinodynamic whole-body MPC formulation evaluated across thousands of agents in parallel at 100 Hz for RL training. The residual policy learns to make targeted corrections to the MPC outputs, combining the interpretability and constraint handling of model-based control with the adaptability of RL. The model-based control prior acts as a strong bias, initializing and guiding the policy towards desirable behavior with a simple set of rewards. Compared to standalone MPC or end-to-end RL, our approach achieves higher sample efficiency, converges to greater asymptotic rewards, expands the range of trackable velocity commands, and enables zero-shot adaptation to unseen gaits and uneven terrain.</p></details> | <details><summary>TRO s...</summary><p>TRO submission preprint</p></details> |
| **[Reflection-Based Task Adaptation for Self-Improving VLA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12710v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a major leap towards general-purpose robots, yet efficiently adapting them to novel, specific tasks in-situ remains a significant hurdle. While reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising avenue for such adaptation, the process often suffers from low efficiency, hindering rapid task mastery. We introduce Reflective Self-Adaptation, a framework for rapid, autonomous task adaptation without human intervention. Our framework establishes a self-improving loop where the agent learns from its own experience to enhance both strategy and execution. The core of our framework is a dual-pathway architecture that addresses the full adaptation lifecycle. First, a Failure-Driven Reflective RL pathway enables rapid learning by using the VLM's causal reasoning to automatically synthesize a targeted, dense reward function from failure analysis. This provides a focused learning signal that significantly accelerates policy exploration. However, optimizing such proxy rewards introduces a potential risk of "reward hacking," where the agent masters the reward function but fails the actual task. To counteract this, our second pathway, Success-Driven Quality-Guided SFT, grounds the policy in holistic success. It identifies and selectively imitates high-quality successful trajectories, ensuring the agent remains aligned with the ultimate task goal. This pathway is strengthened by a conditional curriculum mechanism to aid initial exploration. We conduct experiments in challenging manipulation tasks. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves faster convergence and higher final success rates compared to representative baselines. Our work presents a robust solution for creating self-improving agents that can efficiently and reliably adapt to new environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite Sample Analysis of Linear Temporal Difference Learning with Arbitrary Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21391v4)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear TD($\lambda$) is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms for policy evaluation. Previously, convergence rates are typically established under the assumption of linearly independent features, which does not hold in many practical scenarios. This paper instead establishes the first $L^2$ convergence rates for linear TD($\lambda$) operating under arbitrary features, without making any algorithmic modification or additional assumptions. Our results apply to both the discounted and average-reward settings. To address the potential non-uniqueness of solutions resulting from arbitrary features, we develop a novel stochastic approximation result featuring convergence rates to the solution set instead of a single point.</p></details> |  |
| **[ERA: Transforming VLMs into Embodied Agents via Embodied Prior Learning and Online Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12693v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present \textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2) Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of 8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for future embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous Legged Mobile Manipulation for Lunar Surface Operations via Constrained Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12684v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotics plays a pivotal role in planetary science and exploration, where autonomous and reliable systems are crucial due to the risks and challenges inherent to space environments. The establishment of permanent lunar bases demands robotic platforms capable of navigating and manipulating in the harsh lunar terrain. While wheeled rovers have been the mainstay for planetary exploration, their limitations in unstructured and steep terrains motivate the adoption of legged robots, which offer superior mobility and adaptability. This paper introduces a constrained reinforcement learning framework designed for autonomous quadrupedal mobile manipulators operating in lunar environments. The proposed framework integrates whole-body locomotion and manipulation capabilities while explicitly addressing critical safety constraints, including collision avoidance, dynamic stability, and power efficiency, in order to ensure robust performance under lunar-specific conditions, such as reduced gravity and irregular terrain. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in achieving precise 6D task-space end-effector pose tracking, achieving an average positional accuracy of 4 cm and orientation accuracy of 8.1 degrees. The system consistently respects both soft and hard constraints, exhibiting adaptive behaviors optimized for lunar gravity conditions. This work effectively bridges adaptive learning with essential mission-critical safety requirements, paving the way for advanced autonomous robotic explorers for future lunar missions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the authors version of the paper accepted for publication in The IEEE International Conference on Space Robotics 2025.

We demonstrate that moving beyond the selfish component in the reward significantly relieves this issue. If each AV, apart from minimizing its own travel time, aims to reduce its impact on the system, this will be beneficial not only for the system-wide performance but also for each individual player in this routing game. By introducing an intrinsic reward signal based on the marginal cost matrix, we significantly reduce training time and achieve convergence more reliably. Marginal cost quantifies the impact of each individual action (route-choice) on the system (total travel time). Including it as one of the components of the reward can reduce the degree of non-stationarity by aligning agents' objectives. Notably, the proposed counterfactual formulation preserves the system's equilibria and avoids oscillations. Our experiments show that training MARL algorithms with our novel reward formulation enables the agents to converge to the optimal solution, whereas the baseline algorithms fail to do so. We show these effects in both a toy network and the real-world network of Saint-Arnoult. Our results optimistically indicate that social awareness (i.e., including marginal costs in routing decisions) improves both the system-wide and individual performance of future urban systems with AVs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Pattern Matters: Learning to Reason without Human Rationales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12643v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories (rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model using verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating high-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This paper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially reduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class of problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed, procedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in content such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the solution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the success of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable models to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic matching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral evidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of rationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights, we propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet effective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with task-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations. Experiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR performance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest that large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based automatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Frontiers of Computer Science</p></details> |
| **[Expert or not? assessing data quality in offline reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12638v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets, without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity. Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy. BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization. Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memory as Action: Autonomous Context Curation for Long-Horizon Agentic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12635v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context. Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions, leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm, Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Laminar: A Scalable Asynchronous RL Post-Training Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12633v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency. Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization, allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to sample fibers for goodness-of-fit testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13950v4)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of constructing exact goodness-of-fit tests for discrete exponential family models. This classical problem remains practically unsolved for many types of structured or sparse data, as it rests on a computationally difficult core task: to produce a reliable sample from lattice points in a high-dimensional polytope. We translate the problem into a Markov decision process and demonstrate a reinforcement learning approach for learning `good moves' for sampling. We illustrate the approach on data sets and models for which traditional MCMC samplers converge too slowly due to problem size, sparsity structure, and the requirement to use prohibitive non-linear algebra computations in the process. The differentiating factor is the use of scalable tools from \emph{linear} algebra in the context of theoretical guarantees provided by \emph{non-linear} algebra. Our algorithm is based on an actor-critic sampling scheme, with provable convergence. The discovered moves can be used to efficiently obtain an exchangeable sample, significantly cutting computational times with regards to statistical testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Most ...</summary><p>Most notable change is the link to code on github that implements the actor critic fiber sampler algorithm in python.

| **[General Exploratory Bonus for Optimistic Exploration in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03269v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimistic exploration is central to improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning with human feedback, yet existing exploratory bonus methods to incentivize exploration often fail to realize optimism. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that current formulations, under KL or $\alpha$-divergence regularization, unintentionally bias exploration toward high-probability regions of the reference model, thereby reinforcing conservative behavior instead of promoting discovery of uncertain regions. To address this pitfall, we introduce the General Exploratory Bonus (GEB), a novel theoretical framework that provably satisfies the optimism principle. GEB counteracts divergence-induced bias via reference-dependent reward regulation and unifies prior heuristic bonuses as special cases, while extending naturally across the full $\alpha$-divergence family. Empirically, GEB consistently outperforms baselines on alignment tasks across multiple divergence settings and large language model backbones. These results demonstrate that GEB offers both a principled and practical solution for optimistic exploration in RLHF.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoIRL-AD: Collaborative-Competitive Imitation-Reinforcement Learning in Latent World Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12560v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning (IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines, along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.</p></details> | 18 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Inclusive Fitness as a Key Step Towards More Advanced Social Behaviors in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12555v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically advanced and socially intelligent agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version is a slightly updated version (e.g., added an important reference) compared to the peer-reviewed versions at 'Adapative Learning Agents' at AAMAS 2022 or 'From Cells to Societies' at ICLR 2022</p></details> |
| **[DeepDive: Advancing Deep Search Agents with Knowledge Graphs and Multi-Turn RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10446v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with browsing tools substantially improves their potential as deep search agents to solve complex, real-world tasks. Yet, open LLMs still perform poorly in such settings due to limited long-horizon reasoning capacity with browsing tools and the lack of sufficiently difficult supervised data. To address these challenges, we present DeepDive to advance deep search agents. First, we propose a strategy to automatically synthesize complex, difficult, and hard-to-find questions from open knowledge graphs. Second, we apply end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning with deep search. To encourage diversity and reduce redundancy, we design a redundancy penalty that discourages repeated similar queries. Experiments show that DeepDive-32B achieves a new open-source competitive result on BrowseComp, outperforming WebSailor, DeepSeek-R1-Browse, and Search-o1. We demonstrate that multi-turn RL training improves deep search ability and significantly contributes to the performance improvements across multiple benchmarks. We observe that DeepDive enables test-time scaling of tool calls and parallel sampling. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/DeepDive.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoRFT: Incentivizing Video Reasoning Capability in MLLMs via Reinforced Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12434v4)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has shown great promise in achieving humanlevel reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), and has recently been extended to MLLMs. Nevertheless, reasoning about videos, which is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, remains a persistent challenge due to the complex logic, temporal and causal structures inherent in video data. To fill this gap, we propose VideoRFT, a novel approach that extends the RFT paradigm to cultivate human-like video reasoning capabilities in MLLMs. VideoRFT follows the standard two-stage scheme in RFT: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve generalization. A central challenge to achieve this in the video domain lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality video CoT datasets. We address this by building a multi-expert-driven, cognition-inspired CoT curation pipeline. First, we devise a cognition-inspired prompting strategy to elicit a reasoning LLM to generate preliminary CoTs based solely on rich, structured, and literal representations of video content. Subsequently, these CoTs are revised by a MLLM conditioned on the actual video, ensuring visual consistency and reducing visual hallucinations. This pipeline results in two new datasets, i.e.VideoRFT-CoT-102K for SFT and VideoRFT-RL-310K for RL. To further strengthen the RL phase, we introduce a novel semantic-consistency reward that explicitly promotes the alignment between textual reasoning and visual evidence. This reward encourages the model to produce coherent, context-aware reasoning outputs grounded in visual input. Extensive experiments show that VideoRFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six video reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

| **[A Task-Efficient Reinforcement Learning Task-Motion Planner for Safe Human-Robot Cooperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12477v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a Human-Robot Cooperation (HRC) environment, safety and efficiency are the two core properties to evaluate robot performance. However, safety mechanisms usually hinder task efficiency since human intervention will cause backup motions and goal failures of the robot. Frequent motion replanning will increase the computational load and the chance of failure. In this paper, we present a hybrid Reinforcement Learning (RL) planning framework which is comprised of an interactive motion planner and a RL task planner. The RL task planner attempts to choose statistically safe and efficient task sequences based on the feedback from the motion planner, while the motion planner keeps the task execution process collision-free by detecting human arm motions and deploying new paths when the previous path is not valid anymore. Intuitively, the RL agent will learn to avoid dangerous tasks, while the motion planner ensures that the chosen tasks are safe. The proposed framework is validated on the cobot in both simulation and the real world, we compare the planner with hard-coded task motion planning methods. The results show that our planning framework can 1) react to uncertain human motions at both joint and task levels; 2) reduce the times of repeating failed goal commands; 3) reduce the total number of replanning requests.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Optimization for Dynamic Pricing and Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12447v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies. However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process (GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) -- a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue, while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic pricing in complex, uncertain environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Biased-Attention Guided Risk Prediction for Safe Decision-Making at Unsignalized Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12428v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is available at https://github.com/hank111525/SAC-RWB.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Fictitious Self-Play for Competitive Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00841v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables policy improvement from fixed datasets without online interactions, making it highly suitable for real-world applications lacking efficient simulators. Despite its success in the single-agent setting, offline multi-agent RL remains a challenge, especially in competitive games. Firstly, unaware of the game structure, it is impossible to interact with the opponents and conduct a major learning paradigm, self-play, for competitive games. Secondly, real-world datasets cannot cover all the state and action space in the game, resulting in barriers to identifying Nash equilibrium (NE). To address these issues, this paper introduces OFF-FSP, the first practical model-free offline RL algorithm for competitive games. We start by simulating interactions with various opponents by adjusting the weights of the fixed dataset with importance sampling. This technique allows us to learn the best responses to different opponents and employ the Offline Self-Play learning framework. To overcome the challenge of partial coverage, we combine the single-agent offline RL method with Fictitious Self-Play (FSP) to approximate NE by constraining the approximate best responses away from out-of-distribution actions. Experiments on matrix games, extensive-form poker, and board games demonstrate that OFF-FSP achieves significantly lower exploitability than state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, we validate OFF-FSP on a real-world human-robot competitive task, demonstrating its potential for solving complex, hard-to-simulate real-world problems.</p></details> |  |

However, in the domain of reinforcement learning (RL) for robot motion control, individual skills are often learned from scratch despite the high likelihood that some generalizable knowledge is shared across all task-specific policies belonging to a single robot embodiment. This work aims to define a paradigm for pretraining neural network models that encapsulate such knowledge and can subsequently serve as a basis for warm-starting the RL process in classic actor-critic algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We begin with a task-agnostic exploration-based data collection algorithm to gather diverse, dynamic transition data, which is then used to train a Proprioceptive Inverse Dynamics Model (PIDM) through supervised learning. The pretrained weights are loaded into both the actor and critic networks to warm-start the policy optimization of actual tasks. We systematically validated our proposed method on seven distinct robot motion control tasks, showing significant benefits to this initialization strategy. Our proposed approach on average improves sample efficiency by 40.1% and task performance by 7.5%, compared to random initialization. We further present key ablation studies and empirical analyses that shed light on the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Reward Model via Sparse Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08746v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (SARM), a novel architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment performance compared to conventional reward models.

| **[Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning for Large-Scale EV Smart Charging Considering Distribution Network Voltage Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12335v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electric Vehicles (EVs) offer substantial flexibility for grid services, yet large-scale, uncoordinated charging can threaten voltage stability in distribution networks. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for smart charging often disregard physical grid constraints or have limited performance for complex large-scale tasks, limiting their scalability and real-world applicability. This paper introduces a physics-informed (PI) RL algorithm that integrates a differentiable power flow model and voltage-based reward design into the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, enabling EVs to deliver real-time voltage support while meeting user demands. The resulting PI-TD3 algorithm achieves faster convergence, improved sample efficiency, and reliable voltage magnitude regulation under uncertain and overloaded conditions. Benchmarks on the IEEE 34-bus and 123-bus networks show that the proposed PI-TD3 outperforms both model-free RL and optimization-based baselines in grid constraint management, user satisfaction, and economic metrics, even as the system scales to hundreds of EVs. These advances enable robust, scalable, and practical EV charging strategies that enhance grid resilience and support distribution networks operation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-time Convergence Analysis of Actor-Critic with Evolving Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12334v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in the static-reward case.</p></details> |  |

However, current LRMs exhibit two critical limitations when processing non-English languages: (1) They often struggle to maintain input-output language consistency; (2) They generally perform poorly with wrong reasoning paths and lower answer accuracy compared to English. These limitations significantly degrade the user experience for non-English speakers and hinder the global deployment of LRMs. To address these limitations, we propose M-Thinker, which is trained by the GRPO algorithm that involves a Language Consistency (LC) reward and a novel Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment (CTA) reward. Specifically, the LC reward defines a strict constraint on the language consistency between the input, thought, and answer. Besides, the CTA reward compares the model's non-English reasoning paths with its English reasoning path to transfer its own reasoning capability from English to non-English languages. Through an iterative RL procedure, our M-Thinker-1.5B/7B models not only achieve nearly 100% language consistency and superior performance on two multilingual benchmarks (MMATH and PolyMath), but also exhibit excellent generalization on out-of-domain languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 tables, 4 figures.

| **[Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization for Memory-efficient RL of Diffusion Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11683v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance. Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

In this work, we present sparse Autoencoder For Enhanced Reward model (\textbf{SAFER}), a novel framework for interpreting and improving reward models through mechanistic analysis. Leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), we uncover human-interpretable features in reward model activations, enabling insight into safety-relevant decision-making. We apply SAFER to safety-oriented preference datasets and quantify the salience of individual features by activation differences between chosen and rejected responses. Using these feature-level signals, we design targeted data poisoning and denoising strategies. Experiments show that SAFER can precisely degrade or enhance safety alignment with minimal data modification, without sacrificing general chat performance. Our approach contributes to interpreting, auditing and refining reward models in high-stakes LLM alignment tasks.

We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep" analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, 17 pages appendix (excluding references)</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Explore in Diverse Reward Settings via Temporal-Difference-Error Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13345v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous heuristics and advanced approaches have been proposed for exploration in different settings for deep reinforcement learning. Noise-based exploration generally fares well with dense-shaped rewards and bonus-based exploration with sparse rewards. However, these methods usually require additional tuning to deal with undesirable reward settings by adjusting hyperparameters and noise distributions. Rewards that actively discourage exploration, i.e., with an action cost and no other dense signal to follow, can pose a major challenge. We propose a novel exploration method, Stable Error-seeking Exploration (SEE), that is robust across dense, sparse, and exploration-adverse reward settings. To this endeavor, we revisit the idea of maximizing the TD-error as a separate objective. Our method introduces three design choices to mitigate instability caused by far-off-policy learning, the conflict of interest of maximizing the cumulative TD-error in an episodic setting, and the non-stationary nature of TD-errors. SEE can be combined with off-policy algorithms without modifying the optimization pipeline of the original objective. In our experimental analysis, we show that a Soft-Actor Critic agent with the addition of SEE performs robustly across three diverse reward settings in a variety of tasks without hyperparameter adjustments.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Price of a Second Thought: On the Evaluation of Reasoning Efficiency in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22017v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent thinking models trained with reinforcement learning and backward-checking CoT often suffer from overthinking: they produce excessively long outputs even on simple problems, wasting computation. Existing evaluations, based on token efficiency, give an incomplete view as they neglect problem difficulty and intermediate computation costs. We formalize reasoning efficiency as a relative measure between thinking and instruct models, treating instruct models as the minimal-effort baseline. A systematic study across four thinking models and multiple benchmarks reveals two consistent patterns: (i) instruct models achieve higher efficiency overall, and (ii) problem difficulty affects efficiency, with thinking models wasting computation on easy problems but providing value on harder ones. Building on this insight, we propose COTHINK, a simple two-stage pipeline: an instruct model drafts a brief outline, and a thinking model expands it. On GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME24, COTHINK cuts token usage by 21.1% while keeping accuracy on four thinking models, and remains competitive with strong efficiency baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added new experiments and revised the manuscript for clarity</p></details> |

We propose a novel post training framework that incorporates task aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple EO benchmarks show consistent performance gains over state of the art generic and specialized vision language models.

| **[Heterogeneous RBCs via deep multi-agent reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12272v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current macroeconomic models with agent heterogeneity can be broadly divided into two main groups. Heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium (GE) models, such as those based on Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) or Krusell-Smith (KS) approaches, rely on GE and 'rational expectations', somewhat unrealistic assumptions that make the models very computationally cumbersome, which in turn limits the amount of heterogeneity that can be modelled. In contrast, agent-based models (ABMs) can flexibly encompass a large number of arbitrarily heterogeneous agents, but typically require the specification of explicit behavioural rules, which can lead to a lengthy trial-and-error model-development process. To address these limitations, we introduce MARL-BC, a framework that integrates deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Real Business Cycle (RBC) models. We demonstrate that MARL-BC can: (1) recover textbook RBC results when using a single agent; (2) recover the results of the mean-field KS model using a large number of identical agents; and (3) effectively simulate rich heterogeneity among agents, a hard task for traditional GE approaches. Our framework can be thought of as an ABM if used with a variety of heterogeneous interacting agents, and can reproduce GE results in limit cases. As such, it is a step towards a synthesis of these often opposed modelling paradigms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[DoctorAgent-RL: A Multi-Agent Collaborative Reinforcement Learning System for Multi-Turn Clinical Dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19630v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the field of biomedical question answering, but their application in real-world clinical consultations still faces core challenges. Single-round consultation systems require patients to describe all symptoms upfront, leading to vague diagnosis with unclear complaints. Traditional multi-turn dialogue models, constrained by static supervised learning, lack flexibility and fail to intelligently extract key clinical information. To address these limitations, we propose \Ours{}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent collaborative framework that models medical consultations as a dynamic decision-making process under uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously optimizes its questioning strategy within the RL framework through multi-turn interactions with the patient agent, dynamically adjusting its information-gathering path based on comprehensive rewards from the Consultation Evaluator. This RL fine-tuning mechanism enables LLMs to autonomously develop interaction strategies aligned with clinical reasoning logic, rather than superficially imitating patterns in existing dialogue data. Notably, we constructed MTMedDialog, the first English multi-turn medical consultation dataset capable of simulating patient interactions. Experiments demonstrate that \Ours{} outperforms existing models in both multi-turn reasoning capability and final diagnostic performance. This approach shows immense practical value by reducing misdiagnosis risks in time-pressured settings, freeing clinicians for complex cases, and pioneering a strategy to optimize medical resource allocation and alleviate workforce shortages.

| **[Human-in-the-Loop Bandwidth Estimation for Quality of Experience Optimization in Real-Time Video Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12265v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quality of experience (QoE) delivered by video conferencing systems is significantly influenced by accurately estimating the time-varying available bandwidth between the sender and receiver. Bandwidth estimation for real-time communications remains an open challenge due to rapidly evolving network architectures, increasingly complex protocol stacks, and the difficulty of defining QoE metrics that reliably improve user experience. In this work, we propose a deployed, human-in-the-loop, data-driven framework for bandwidth estimation to address these challenges. Our approach begins with training objective QoE reward models derived from subjective user evaluations to measure audio and video quality in real-time video conferencing systems. Subsequently, we collect roughly $1$M network traces with objective QoE rewards from real-world Microsoft Teams calls to curate a bandwidth estimation training dataset. We then introduce a novel distributional offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to train a neural-network-based bandwidth estimator aimed at improving QoE for users. Our real-world A/B test demonstrates that the proposed approach reduces the subjective poor call ratio by $11.41\%$ compared to the baseline bandwidth estimator. Furthermore, the proposed offline RL algorithm is benchmarked on D4RL tasks to demonstrate its generalization beyond bandwidth estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2026 (IAAI Technical Track on Deployed Highly Innovative Applications of AI)</p></details> |
| **[$\mathbf{T^3}$: Reducing Belief Deviation in Reinforcement Learning for Active Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12264v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems. Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs, lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL) training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop $\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$ systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks, $\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.</p></details> |  |

This survey delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field. We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively maintaining a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ChangfuXu/D4RL-FTD) for papers and other related resources to apply DMs for RL.</p></details> | Under Review |

This paper introduces L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework. Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS, deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability, presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint was submitted to IEEE TrustCom 2025.

However, their effective deployment across diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity. At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators, optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of PromptFlow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 18 pages, 14 figures, conference submission, appendix included</p></details> |

While further SFT and RLHF-based safety training can be conducted in multi-modal settings, collecting multi-modal training datasets poses a significant challenge. Inspired by the structural design of recent multi-modal models, where, regardless of the combination of input modalities, all inputs are ultimately fused into the language space, we aim to explore whether unlearning solely in the textual domain can be effective for cross-modality safety alignment. Our evaluation across six datasets empirically demonstrates the transferability -- textual unlearning in VLMs significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to less than 8\% and in some cases, even as low as nearly 2\% for both text-based and vision-text-based attacks, alongside preserving the utility. Moreover, our experiments show that unlearning with a multi-modal dataset offers no potential benefits but incurs significantly increased computational demands, possibly up to 6 times higher.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024 Findings</p></details> |

Robust safe RL techniques are provably safe, however difficult to scale, while domain randomization is more practical yet prone to unsafe behaviors. We address this gap by proposing SPiDR, short for Sim-to-real via Pessimistic Domain Randomization -- a scalable algorithm with provable guarantees for safe sim-to-real transfer. SPiDR uses domain randomization to incorporate the uncertainty about the sim-to-real gap into the safety constraints, making it versatile and highly compatible with existing training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on sim-to-sim benchmarks and two distinct real-world robotic platforms, we demonstrate that SPiDR effectively ensures safety despite the sim-to-real gap while maintaining strong performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mirror Descent Actor Critic via Bounded Advantage Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03854v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regularization is a core component of recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Mirror Descent Value Iteration (MDVI) uses both Kullback-Leibler divergence and entropy as regularizers in its value and policy updates. Despite its empirical success in discrete action domains and strong theoretical guarantees, the performance of KL-entroy-regularized methods do not surpass a strong entropy-only-regularized method in continuous action domains. In this study, we propose Mirror Descent Actor Critic (MDAC) as an actor-critic style instantiation of MDVI for continuous action domains, and show that its empirical performance is significantly boosted by bounding the actor's log-density terms in the critic's loss function, compared to a non-bounded naive instantiation. Further, we relate MDAC to Advantage Learning by recalling that the actor's log-probability is equal to the regularized advantage function in tabular cases, and theoretically discuss when and why bounding the advantage terms is validated and beneficial. We also empirically explore effective choices for the bounding functions, and show that MDAC performs better than strong non-regularized and entropy-only-regularized methods with an appropriate choice of the bounding functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Preference Optimization for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12211v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally shifted recommender systems from discriminative to generative paradigms, where user behavior modeling is achieved by generating target items conditioned on historical interactions. Yet current generative recommenders still suffer from two core limitations: the lack of high-quality negative modeling and the reliance on implicit rewards. Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) offers a natural solution by enabling on-policy sampling of harder negatives and grounding optimization in explicit reward signals. However, applying RLVR to generative recommenders remains non-trivial. Its unique generation space often leads to invalid or repetitive items that undermine sampling efficiency, and ranking supervision is sparse since most items receive identical zero rewards. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforced Preference Optimization for Recommendation (ReRe), a reinforcement-based paradigm tailored to LLM-based recommenders, an important direction in generative recommendation. ReRe incorporates constrained beam search to improve sampling efficiency and diversify hard negatives, while augmenting rule-based accuracy rewards with auxiliary ranking rewards for finer-grained supervision. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that ReRe consistently outperforms both traditional and LLM-based recommenders in ranking performance. Further analysis shows that ReRe not only enhances performance across both base and SFT-initialized models but also generalizes robustly across different backbone families and scales. Beyond empirical gains, we systematically investigate the design space of RLVR in recommendation across generation, sampling strategy, reward modeling, and optimization algorithm, offering insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

The MFAC framework jointly evolves the control (actor), value function (critic), and distribution components through coupled gradient-based updates governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). A central innovation is the Optimal Transport Geodesic Picard (OTGP) flow, which drives the distribution toward equilibrium along Wasserstein-2 geodesics. We conduct a rigorous convergence analysis using Lyapunov functionals and establish global exponential convergence of the MFAC flow under a suitable timescale. Our results highlight the algorithmic interplay among actor, critic, and distribution components. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the MFAC framework in computing MFG equilibria.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Verifying Reflection Helps Transformers with CoT Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12157v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion, integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2025</p></details> |
| **[Stronger Together: On-Policy Reinforcement Learning for Collaborative LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11062v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However, applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and multi-policy models. We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single- and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks, AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5 percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to 7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math.

To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Efficient Reasoning</p></details> |

While recent benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75%) and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking the Role of Dynamic Sparse Training for Scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12096v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning, yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic modifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[IBCL: Zero-shot Model Generation under Stability-Plasticity Trade-offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14782v4)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithms that balance the stability-plasticity trade-off are well studied in the Continual Learning literature. However, only a few focus on obtaining models for specified trade-off preferences. When solving the problem of continual learning under specific trade-offs (CLuST), state-of-the-art techniques leverage rehearsal-based learning, which requires retraining when a model corresponding to a new trade-off preference is requested. This is inefficient, since there potentially exists a significant number of different trade-offs, and a large number of models may be requested. As a response, we propose Imprecise Bayesian Continual Learning (IBCL), an algorithm that tackles CLuST efficiently. IBCL replaces retraining with a constant-time convex combination. Given a new task, IBCL (1) updates the knowledge base as a convex hull of model parameter distributions, and (2) generates one Pareto-optimal model per given trade-off via convex combination without additional training. That is, obtaining models corresponding to specified trade-offs via IBCL is zero-shot. Experiments whose baselines are current CLuST algorithms show that IBCL improves classification by at most 44% on average per task accuracy, and by 45% on peak per task accuracy while maintaining a near-zero to positive backward transfer, with memory overheads converging to constants. In addition, its training overhead, measured by the number of batch updates, remains constant at every task, regardless of the number of preferences requested. IBCL also improves multi-objective reinforcement learning tasks by maintaining the same Pareto front hypervolume, while significantly reducing the training cost.

| **[Provably Efficient RL under Episode-Wise Safety in Constrained MDPs with Linear Function Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10138v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the reinforcement learning (RL) problem in a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), where an agent explores the environment to maximize the expected cumulative reward while satisfying a single constraint on the expected total utility value in every episode. While this problem is well understood in the tabular setting, theoretical results for function approximation remain scarce. This paper closes the gap by proposing an RL algorithm for linear CMDPs that achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{K})$ regret with an episode-wise zero-violation guarantee. Furthermore, our method is computationally efficient, scaling polynomially with problem-dependent parameters while remaining independent of the state space size. Our results significantly improve upon recent linear CMDP algorithms, which either violate the constraint or incur exponential computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Posterior Sampling for Continuing Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15931v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop an extension of posterior sampling for reinforcement learning (PSRL) that is suited for a continuing agent-environment interface and integrates naturally into agent designs that scale to complex environments. The approach, continuing PSRL, maintains a statistically plausible model of the environment and follows a policy that maximizes expected $\gamma$-discounted return in that model. At each time, with probability $1-\gamma$, the model is replaced by a sample from the posterior distribution over environments. For a choice of discount factor that suitably depends on the horizon $T$, we establish an $\tilde{O}(\tau S \sqrt{A T})$ bound on the Bayesian regret, where $S$ is the number of environment states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $\tau$ denotes the reward averaging time, which is a bound on the duration required to accurately estimate the average reward of any policy. Our work is the first to formalize and rigorously analyze the resampling approach with randomized exploration.</p></details> | RLC 2024 |
| **[Agent Learning via Early Experience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08558v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks. However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards (e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Scalable Policy-Based RL Algorithms for POMDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06540v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The continuous nature of belief states in POMDPs presents significant computational challenges in learning the optimal policy. In this paper, we consider an approach that solves a Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning (PORL) problem by approximating the corresponding POMDP model into a finite-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) (called Superstate MDP). We first derive theoretical guarantees that improve upon prior work that relate the optimal value function of the transformed Superstate MDP to the optimal value function of the original POMDP. Next, we propose a policy-based learning approach with linear function approximation to learn the optimal policy for the Superstate MDP. Consequently, our approach shows that a POMDP can be approximately solved using TD-learning followed by Policy Optimization by treating it as an MDP, where the MDP state corresponds to a finite history. We show that the approximation error decreases exponentially with the length of this history. To the best of our knowledge, our finite-time bounds are the first to explicitly quantify the error introduced when applying standard TD learning to a setting where the true dynamics are not Markovian.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 3 Figures, Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we consider a mirror-based IRS to assist a dynamic indoor visible light communication (VLC) environment. We formulate an optimization problem that aims to maximize the sum rate by adjusting the orientation of the IRS mirrors. To enable real-time adaptability, the problem is modelled as a Markov decision process (MDP), and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is developed based on the deterministic policy gradient for real-time mirror-based IRS optimization in dynamic VLC networks. The proposed DRL is employed to optimize mirror orientation toward mobile users under blockage and mobility constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed DRL algorithm outperforms the conventional deep Q- learning (DQL) algorithm and achieves substantial improvements in sum rate compared to random-orientation IRS configurations</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$ smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based context management.</p></details> |  |
| **[COMAL: A Convergent Meta-Algorithm for Aligning LLMs with General Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23223v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many alignment methods, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), rely on the Bradley-Terry reward assumption, which is not always sufficient to capture the full range and complexity of general human preferences. We explore RLHF under a general preference framework by modeling the alignment problem as a two-player zero-sum game in a game-theoretic framework, where the Nash equilibrium policy guarantees a 50% win rate against any competing policy. However, previous self-play algorithms for finding the Nash policy either diverge or only converge to a Nash policy in a modified game, even in a simple synthetic setting, thereby failing to maintain the 50% win rate guarantee against all other policies. We propose a meta-algorithm, Convergent Meta Alignment Algorithm (COMAL), for language model alignment with general preferences, inspired by convergent algorithms in game theory. We provide theoretical analysis that our meta-algorithm converges to an exact Nash policy in the last iterate and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of synthetic and preference optimization datasets. COMAL is simple and can be integrated with many existing methods designed for preference optimization with minimal changes, and empirically it consistently maintains above 60.2% and 56.8% win rates, when applied to Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B, against all compared algorithms under controlled evaluations.</p></details> |  |

We identify two core issues with the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$% relative to RestartQ-UCB.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper contains 19 pages and 3 figures.

We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation (AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC, Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

Recent theories suggest that loss power laws arise from Zipf's law, a power law observed in domains like natural language. One theory suggests that language scaling laws emerge when Zipf-distributed task quanta are learned in descending order of frequency. In this paper we examine power-law scaling in AlphaZero, a reinforcement learning algorithm, using a model of language-model scaling. We find that game states in training and inference data scale with Zipf's law, which is known to arise from the tree structure of the environment, and examine the correlation between scaling-law and Zipf's-law exponents. In agreement with the quanta scaling model, we find that agents optimize state loss in descending order of frequency, even though this order scales inversely with modelling complexity. We also find that inverse scaling, the failure of models to improve with size, is correlated with unusual Zipf curves where end-game states are among the most frequent states. We show evidence that larger models shift their focus to these less-important states, sacrificing their understanding of important early-game states.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range of adversarial stochastic games.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Reliable ML Workshop @ NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Conventional reinforcement learning agents often fail in this domain, as their unimodal policy structures cannot model the multi-modal nature of optimal allocation strategies. This paper introduces Diffusion Q-Learning (Diffusion-QL), a novel framework that represents the policy as a conditional diffusion model. Our approach generates resource allocation actions by iteratively reversing a noising process, with each step guided by the gradient of a learned Q-function. This method enables the policy to learn and sample from the complex distribution of near-optimal actions. Simulations demonstrate that the Diffusion-QL approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DRL baselines, offering a robust solution for the intricate resource management challenges in next-generation wireless networks.</p></details> |  |

A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Empirical Study on Robustness and Resilience in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11824v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), it is a common practice to tune hyperparameters in ideal simulated environments to maximize cooperative performance. However, policies tuned for cooperation often fail to maintain robustness and resilience under real-world uncertainties. Building trustworthy MARL systems requires a deep understanding of robustness, which ensures stability under uncertainties, and resilience, the ability to recover from disruptions--a concept extensively studied in control systems but largely overlooked in MARL. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study comprising over 82,620 experiments to evaluate cooperation, robustness, and resilience in MARL across 4 real-world environments, 13 uncertainty types, and 15 hyperparameters. Our key findings are: (1) Under mild uncertainty, optimizing cooperation improves robustness and resilience, but this link weakens as perturbations intensify. Robustness and resilience also varies by algorithm and uncertainty type. (2) Robustness and resilience do not generalize across uncertainty modalities or agent scopes: policies robust to action noise for all agents may fail under observation noise on a single agent. (3) Hyperparameter tuning is critical for trustworthy MARL: surprisingly, standard practices like parameter sharing, GAE, and PopArt can hurt robustness, while early stopping, high critic learning rates, and Leaky ReLU consistently help. By optimizing hyperparameters only, we observe substantial improvement in cooperation, robustness and resilience across all MARL backbones, with the phenomenon also generalizing to robust MARL methods across these backbones.

We state a connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential samplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein learnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist functions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training procedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt sampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target distribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training signal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience replay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay buffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete spaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we demonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as training stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/hyeok9855/gfn-smc-jax</p></details> |

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic investigation to demystify reinforcement learning in agentic reasoning from three key perspectives: data, algorithm, and reasoning mode. We highlight our key insights: (i) Replacing stitched synthetic trajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories yields a far stronger SFT initialization; high-diversity, model-aware datasets sustain exploration and markedly improve RL performance. (ii) Exploration-friendly techniques are crucial for agentic RL, such as clip higher, overlong reward shaping, and maintaining adequate policy entropy could improve the training efficiency. (iii) A deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls outperforms frequent tool calls or verbose self-reasoning, improving tool efficiency and final accuracy. Together, these simple practices consistently enhance agentic reasoning and training efficiency, achieving strong results on challenging benchmarks with smaller models, and establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL research. Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a high-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL dataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including AIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6.

Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR: Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of 4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and solving under verifiable environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[QeRL: Beyond Efficiency -- Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11696v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4 quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/QeRL</p></details> |

While reinforcement learning (RL) policies trained in simulation present a scalable alternative, effective sim-to-real transfer remains challenging, particularly for tasks that require precise dynamics. To address this, we propose Phys2Real, a real-to-sim-to-real RL pipeline that combines vision-language model (VLM)-inferred physical parameter estimates with interactive adaptation through uncertainty-aware fusion. Our approach consists of three core components: (1) high-fidelity geometric reconstruction with 3D Gaussian splatting, (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions over physical parameters, and (3) online physical parameter estimation from interaction data. Phys2Real conditions policies on interpretable physical parameters, refining VLM predictions with online estimates via ensemble-based uncertainty quantification. On planar pushing tasks of a T-block with varying center of mass (CoM) and a hammer with an off-center mass distribution, Phys2Real achieves substantial improvements over a domain randomization baseline: 100% vs 79% success rate for the bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23% in the challenging top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average task completion for hammer pushing. Ablation studies indicate that the combination of VLM and interaction information is essential for success. Project website: https://phys2real.github.io/ .</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly incentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to understand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our main finding is that exploration with a simple, principled, representation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden states significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for post-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For inference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves efficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and reasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50% improvement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we show that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves reasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL post-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model, demonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency. Overall, our findings suggest that deliberate exploration -- with the right notion of diversity -- is a practical path toward discovery of new behaviors beyond sharpening.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website and code: https://rep-exp.github.io</p></details> |

Traditional optimization-based planners struggle with contact complexity, while on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) is sample-inefficient and has limited multi-task ability. We propose a framework combining a learned world model with sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC), trained on a demonstration-free offline dataset to predict future outcomes in a compressed latent space. To address sparse contact rewards and sensor noise, the MPC uses a learned surrogate value function for dense, robust planning. Our single, scalable model supports contact-aware tasks, including wall support after perturbation, blocking incoming objects, and traversing height-limited arches, with improved data efficiency and multi-task capability over on-policy RL. Deployed on a physical humanoid, our system achieves robust, real-time contact planning from proprioception and ego-centric depth images. Website: https://ego-vcp.github.io/</p></details> |  |
| **[SR-Scientist: Scientific Equation Discovery With Agentic AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11661v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to scientific equation discovery, leveraging their embedded scientific knowledge for hypothesis generation. However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming. In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines. Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[MATH-Beyond: A Benchmark for RL to Expand Beyond the Base Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11653v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL) methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning. However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\texttt{pass@1024}$), many existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform poorly on MATH-B at $\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We release MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let's Reason Formally: Natural-Formal Hybrid Reasoning Enhances LLM's Math Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23703v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning (NFL-HR)**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the NL-FL Problem Alignment method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the Mixed Problem Input technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based Answer Extraction mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the NFL-HR framework achieves **89.80**% and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by **4.60%** and **4.82%**, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Hidden Link Between RLHF and Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22578v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values has recently garnered significant attention, with prominent examples including the canonical yet costly Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the simple Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this work, we demonstrate that both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI) maximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within this framework, both RLHF and DPO can be interpreted as methods that performing contrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI (equivalently, the MINE estimator). Such paradigm further illuminates why RLHF may not intrinsically incentivize reasoning capacities in LLMs beyond what is already present in the base model. Building on the perspective, we replace the DV/MINE bound with the Jensen-Shannon (JS) MI estimator and propose the Mutual Information Optimization (MIO). Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that MIO mitigates the late-stage decline in chosen-likelihood observed in DPO, achieving competitive or superior performance across various challenging reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

| **[EvoEmo: Towards Evolved Emotional Policies for Adversarial LLM Agents in Multi-Turn Price Negotiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04310v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex}, \textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However, existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for multi-turn negotiation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding Energy-Efficient Locomotion through Impact Mitigation Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09543v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animals achieve energy-efficient locomotion by their implicit passive dynamics, a marvel that has captivated roboticists for decades.Recently, methods incorporated Adversarial Motion Prior (AMP) and Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promising progress to replicate Animals' naturalistic motion. However, such imitation learning approaches predominantly capture explicit kinematic patterns, so-called gaits, while overlooking the implicit passive dynamics. This work bridges this gap by incorporating a reward term guided by Impact Mitigation Factor (IMF), a physics-informed metric that quantifies a robot's ability to passively mitigate impacts. By integrating IMF with AMP, our approach enables RL policies to learn both explicit motion trajectories from animal reference motion and the implicit passive dynamic. We demonstrate energy efficiency improvements of up to 32%, as measured by the Cost of Transport (CoT), across both AMP and handcrafted reward structure.</p></details> |  |

Yet, it can be difficult to tune desired robot behaviors due to unintuitive and complex reward design. In comparison, offline trajectory optimization methods, like Hybrid Zero Dynamics, offer more tuneable, interpretable, and mathematically grounded motion plans for high-dimensional legged systems. However, these methods often remain brittle to real-world disturbances like external perturbations. In this work, we present NaviGait, a hierarchical framework that combines the structure of trajectory optimization with the adaptability of RL for robust and intuitive locomotion control. NaviGait leverages a library of offline-optimized gaits and smoothly interpolates between them to produce continuous reference motions in response to high-level commands. The policy provides both joint-level and velocity command residual corrections to modulate and stabilize the reference trajectories in the gait library. One notable advantage of NaviGait is that it dramatically simplifies reward design by encoding rich motion priors from trajectory optimization, reducing the need for finely tuned shaping terms and enabling more stable and interpretable learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that NaviGait enables faster training compared to conventional and imitation-based RL, and produces motions that remain closest to the original reference. Overall, by decoupling high-level motion generation from low-level correction, NaviGait offers a more scalable and generalizable approach for achieving dynamic and robust locomotion.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Flexible Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Dynamic Routing and Scheduling of Latency-Critical Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11535v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely delivery of delay-sensitive information over dynamic, heterogeneous networks is increasingly essential for a range of interactive applications, such as industrial automation, self-driving vehicles, and augmented reality. However, most existing network control solutions target only average delay performance, falling short of providing strict End-to-End (E2E) peak latency guarantees. This paper addresses the challenge of reliably delivering packets within application-imposed deadlines by leveraging recent advancements in Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL). After introducing the Delay-Constrained Maximum-Throughput (DCMT) dynamic network control problem, and highlighting the limitations of current solutions, we present a novel MA-DRL network control framework that leverages a centralized routing and distributed scheduling architecture. The proposed framework leverages critical networking domain knowledge for the design of effective MA-DRL strategies based on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) technique, where centralized routing and distributed scheduling agents dynamically assign paths and schedule packet transmissions according to packet lifetimes, thereby maximizing on-time packet delivery. The generality of the proposed framework allows integrating both data-driven \blue{Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)} agents and traditional rule-based policies in order to strike the right balance between performance and learning complexity. Our results confirm the superiority of the proposed framework with respect to traditional stochastic optimization-based approaches and provide key insights into the role and interplay between data-driven DRL agents and new rule-based policies for both efficient and high-performance control of latency-critical services.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13837v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly on mathematics and programming tasks. Similar to how traditional RL helps agents explore and learn new strategies, RLVR is believed to enable LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities beyond those of the corresponding base models. In this study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically probing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various model families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning benchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric. Surprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform their base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher pass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the observed reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model. Treating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that six popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in leveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that distillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and genuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that current RLVR methods have not yet realized the potential of RL to elicit truly novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This highlights the need for improved RL paradigms, such as continual scaling and multi-turn agent-environment interaction, to unlock this potential.</p></details> | 30 pages, 27 figures |

Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax) formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward RL. Empirically, PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward recovery, policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo and Gym-Robotics benchmarks and a real-world animal behavior modeling task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025.

This aging is typically reflected through the resistance growth and the capacity fade of battery cells. Over the years, various charging methods have been presented in the literature that proposed current profiles in order to enable optimal, fast, and/or health-conscious charging. However, very few works have attempted to make the ubiquitous Constant Current Constant Voltage (CCCV) charging protocol adaptive to the changing battery health as it cycles. This work aims to address this gap and proposes a framework that optimizes the constant current part of the CCCV protocol adapting to long-term battery degradation. Specifically, a physics-informed Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach has been used that not only estimates a key battery degradation mechanism, namely, Loss of Active Material (LAM), but also adjusts the current magnitude of CCCV as a result of this particular degradation. The proposed framework has been implemented by combining PyBamm, an open-source battery modeling tool, and Stable-baselines where the RL agent was trained using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) network. Simulation results show the potential of the proposed framework for enhancing the widely used CCCV protocol by embedding physics information in RL algorithm. A comparative study of this proposed agent has also been discussed with 2 other charging protocols generated by a non-physics-based RL agent and a constant CCCV for all the cycles.</p></details> |  |

The MF-RIS plays a pivotal role in addressing the energy shortages of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operating in the shadowed regions, while accounting for both communication and computing energy consumption across the SAGIN nodes. To maximize the long-term energy efficiency (EE) of IoT devices, we formulate a joint optimization problem over the MF-RIS parameters, including signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, and active element selection as well as the SAGIN parameters of beamforming vectors, high-altitude platform station (HAPS) deployment, IoT device association, and computing capability. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and non-linear and contains mixed discrete-continuous parameters. To tackle this, we conceive a compressed hybrid twin-model enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (CHIMERA) framework, which integrates semantic state-action compression and parametrized sharing under hybrid reinforcement learning to efficiently explore suitable complex actions. The simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed CHIMERA scheme substantially outperforms the conventional benchmarks, including fixed-configuration or non-harvesting MF-RIS, traditional RIS, and no-RIS cases, as well as centralized and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning baselines in terms of the highest EE. Moreover, the proposed SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture in IoT network achieves superior EE performance due to its complementary coverage, offering notable advantages over either standalone satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments.</p></details> |  |

For these vehicles, as well as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics. In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICAR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning with Generative Trajectory Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11499v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex, multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow, iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue, lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool. During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable, vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference, we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle, keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains. Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference decoupling.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Reinforcement Learning After Next-Token Prediction Facilitates Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11495v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings, including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint-Aware Reinforcement Learning via Adaptive Action Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11491v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to mitigate unsafe behaviors that arise from exploration during training by reducing constraint violations while maintaining task performance. Existing approaches typically rely on a single policy to jointly optimize reward and safety, which can cause instability due to conflicting objectives, or they use external safety filters that override actions and require prior system knowledge. In this paper, we propose a modular cost-aware regulator that scales the agent's actions based on predicted constraint violations, preserving exploration through smooth action modulation rather than overriding the policy. The regulator is trained to minimize constraint violations while avoiding degenerate suppression of actions. Our approach integrates seamlessly with off-policy RL methods such as SAC and TD3, and achieves state-of-the-art return-to-cost ratios on Safety Gym locomotion tasks with sparse costs, reducing constraint violations by up to 126 times while increasing returns by over an order of magnitude compared to prior methods.</p></details> |  |

To this end, the decision-making process is organized into two abstraction levels: low-level policies learn precise control maneuvers, while high-level policies issue tactical commands based on mission objectives.

Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the significant benefits of our unified approach.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[From <Answer> to <Think>: Multidimensional Supervision of Reasoning Process for LLM Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11457v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions: Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles. Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the training distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[KnowRL: Teaching Language Models to Know What They Know](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11407v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Truly reliable AI requires more than simply scaling up knowledge; it demands the ability to know what it knows and when it does not. Yet recent research shows that even the best LLMs misjudge their own competence in more than one in five cases, making any response born of such internal uncertainty impossible to fully trust. Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques that require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL that strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility boundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour. Our framework combines two components: (i) introspection, where the model generates and classifies tasks it judges feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based rewarding, where stability of self-knowledge assessment is reinforced through internal agreement. By using internally generated data, this design strengthens consistency in self-knowledge and entirely avoids costly external supervision. In experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL steadily improved self-knowledge, validated by both intrinsic self-consistency and extrinsic benchmarking. With nothing more than a small seed set and no external supervision, our method drove gains as high as 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1, outperforming baselines in just a few iterations. Our framework essentially unlocks the untapped capacity of LLMs to self-improve their knowledge awareness, opening the door to reliable, more accountable AI and safer deployment in critical applications. Owing to its simplicity and independence from external effort, we encourage applying this reliability-enhancing process to all future models.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[From Data to Rewards: a Bilevel Optimization Perspective on Maximum Likelihood Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07624v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models form the backbone of modern machine learning, underpinning state-of-the-art systems in text, vision, and multimodal applications. While Maximum Likelihood Estimation has traditionally served as the dominant training paradigm, recent work have highlighted its limitations, particularly in generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting compared to Reinforcement Learning techniques, such as Policy Gradient methods. However, these approaches depend on explicit reward signals, which are often unavailable in practice, leaving open the fundamental problem of how to align generative models when only high-quality datasets are accessible. In this work, we address this challenge via a Bilevel Optimization framework, where the reward function is treated as the optimization variable of an outer-level problem, while a policy gradient objective defines the inner-level. We then conduct a theoretical analysis of this optimization problem in a tractable setting and extract insights that, as we demonstrate, generalize to applications such as tabular classification and model-based reinforcement learning. We release the code at https://github.com/abenechehab/nll_to_po .</p></details> |  |
| **[Stabilizing MoE Reinforcement Learning by Aligning Training and Inference Routers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11370v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions, the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, despite their superior performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters and inference time.</p></details> |  |

| **[Distributed MPC-based Coordination of Traffic Perimeter and Signal Control: A Lexicographic Optimization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04038v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a comprehensive strategy that integrates traffic perimeter control with traffic signal control to alleviate congestion in an urban traffic network (UTN). The strategy is formulated as a lexicographic multi-objective optimization problem, starting with the regulation of traffic inflows at boundary junctions to maximize the capacity while ensuring a smooth operation of the UTN. Following this, the signal timings at internal junctions are collaboratively optimized to enhance overall traffic conditions under the regulated inflows. The use of a model predictive control (MPC) approach ensures that the control solution adheres to safety and capacity constraints within the network. To address the computational complexity of the problem, the UTN is divided into subnetworks, each managed by a local agent. A distributed solution method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is employed, allowing each agent to determine its optimal control decisions using local information from its subnetwork and neighboring agents. Numerical simulations using VISSIM and MATLAB demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed traffic control strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[FuzzyLight: A Robust Two-Stage Fuzzy Approach for Traffic Signal Control Works in Real Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15820v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial in mitigating urban congestion and reducing emissions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several real-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor accuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data transmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions. (2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could be unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP) selection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on TSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting safety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust two-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing and RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It employs fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances the efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during training and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It works in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior performance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results indicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to expert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six real-world datasets with transmission noise.

| **[Reinforcement Learning Based Traffic Signal Design to Minimize Queue Lengths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21745v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial for reducing congestion, travel delays, pollution, and for ensuring road safety. Traditional approaches, such as fixed signal control and actuated control, often struggle to handle dynamic traffic patterns. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive TSC framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL), using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to minimize total queue lengths across all signal phases. The challenge of efficiently representing highly stochastic traffic conditions for an RL controller is addressed through multiple state representations, including an expanded state space, an autoencoder representation, and a K-Planes-inspired representation. The proposed algorithm has been implemented using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator and demonstrates superior performance over both traditional methods and other conventional RL-based approaches in reducing queue lengths. The best performing configuration achieves an approximately 29% reduction in average queue lengths compared to the traditional Webster method. Furthermore, comparative evaluation of alternative reward formulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed queue-based approach, showcasing the potential for scalable and adaptive urban traffic management.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Distribution Shift Problem in Transportation Networks using Reinforcement Learning and AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15291v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart transportation networks has increased significantly in the last few years. Among these ML and AI approaches, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to be a very promising approach by several authors. However, a problem with using Reinforcement Learning in Traffic Signal Control is the reliability of the trained RL agents due to the dynamically changing distribution of the input data with respect to the distribution of the data used for training. This presents a major challenge and a reliability problem for the trained network of AI agents and could have very undesirable and even detrimental consequences if a suitable solution is not found. Several researchers have tried to address this problem using different approaches. In particular, Meta Reinforcement Learning (Meta RL) promises to be an effective solution. In this paper, we evaluate and analyze a state-of-the-art Meta RL approach called MetaLight and show that, while under certain conditions MetaLight can indeed lead to reasonably good results, under some other conditions it might not perform well (with errors of up to 22%), suggesting that Meta RL schemes are often not robust enough and can even pose major reliability problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic Co-Simulation Framework Empowered by Infrastructure Camera Sensing and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03925v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic simulations are commonly used to optimize urban traffic flow, with reinforcement learning (RL) showing promising potential for automated traffic signal control, particularly in intelligent transportation systems involving connected automated vehicles. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is particularly effective for learning control strategies for traffic lights in a network using iterative simulations. However, existing methods often assume perfect vehicle detection, which overlooks real-world limitations related to infrastructure availability and sensor reliability. This study proposes a co-simulation framework integrating CARLA and SUMO, which combines high-fidelity 3D modeling with large-scale traffic flow simulation. Cameras mounted on traffic light poles within the CARLA environment use a YOLO-based computer vision system to detect and count vehicles, providing real-time traffic data as input for adaptive signal control in SUMO. MARL agents trained with four different reward structures leverage this visual feedback to optimize signal timings and improve network-wide traffic flow. Experiments in a multi-intersection test-bed demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MARL approach in enhancing traffic conditions using real-time camera based detection. The framework also evaluates the robustness of MARL under faulty or sparse sensing and compares the performance of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for vehicle detection. Results show that while better accuracy improves performance, MARL agents can still achieve significant improvements with imperfect detection, demonstrating scalability and adaptability for real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiLight: A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework with Global Adversarial Guidance for Large-Scale Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14391v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is essential for mitigating urban congestion, yet existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods face challenges in scaling to large networks while maintaining global coordination. Centralized RL suffers from scalability issues, while decentralized approaches often lack unified objectives, resulting in limited network-level efficiency. In this paper, we propose HiLight, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with global adversarial guidance for large-scale TSC. HiLight consists of a high-level Meta-Policy, which partitions the traffic network into subregions and generates sub-goals using a Transformer-LSTM architecture, and a low-level Sub-Policy, which controls individual intersections with global awareness. To improve the alignment between global planning and local execution, we introduce an adversarial training mechanism, where the Meta-Policy generates challenging yet informative sub-goals, and the Sub-Policy learns to surpass these targets, leading to more effective coordination. We evaluate HiLight across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and additionally construct a large-scale Manhattan network with diverse traffic conditions, including peak transitions, adverse weather, and holiday surges. Experimental results show that HiLight exhibits significant advantages in large-scale scenarios and remains competitive across standard benchmarks of varying sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvolveSignal: A Large Language Model Powered Coding Agent for Discovering Traffic Signal Control Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03335v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator) and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers. This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Traffic Signal Control with Predictable Cycle Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03118v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile, the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the best performance over all datasets against baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Goal-Conditioned Data Augmentation for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20519v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from pre-collected offline datasets, relaxing the need to interact directly with the environment. However, limited by the quality of offline datasets, it generally fails to learn well-qualified policies in suboptimal datasets. To address datasets with insufficient optimal demonstrations, we introduce Goal-cOnditioned Data Augmentation (GODA), a novel goal-conditioned diffusion-based method for augmenting samples with higher quality. Leveraging recent advancements in generative modelling, GODA incorporates a novel return-oriented goal condition with various selection mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a controllable scaling technique to provide enhanced return-based guidance during data sampling. GODA learns a comprehensive distribution representation of the original offline datasets while generating new data with selectively higher-return goals, thereby maximizing the utility of limited optimal demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a novel adaptive gated conditioning method for processing noisy inputs and conditions, enhancing the capture of goal-oriented guidance. We conduct experiments on the D4RL benchmark and real-world challenges, specifically traffic signal control (TSC) tasks, to demonstrate GODA's effectiveness in enhancing data quality and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art data augmentation methods across various offline RL algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Contextual MARL (cMARL) addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts. Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at https://github.com/DaRL-LibSignal/cMALC-D.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A shorter version has been accepted to the 2025 Conference on Information and Knowledge Management</p></details> |

At the core of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals, autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems. Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA, and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks. The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPLight+: A Genetic Programming Method for Learning Symmetric Traffic Signal Control Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16090v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency function representation can significantly improve the performance of the learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal control policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metering traffic flows for perimeter control through auction-based signalling using connected vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09678v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban traffic congestion remains a critical challenge in modern cities, with traffic signal control systems often struggling to manage congestion during peak travel times. Perimeter control of a Protected Network (PN) has emerged as a potential solution to reducing gridlock in urban networks. This paper proposes a novel auction-based mechanism for green time allocation at signalized intersections, for effective perimeter control application. Utilising a Sealed Bid, Second Price auction framework, our approach combines real-time traffic monitoring with market-inspired mechanisms to regulate vehicle inflows into PN areas. Unlike existing methods that focus primarily on gated links, our system allocates budgets to individual traffic movements, providing greater flexibility in managing multi-directional flows. We evaluate the proposed mechanism using a test case intersection with a single controlled inflow, comparing it against a volume-based fixed-time approach. The results demonstrate that our auction-based method controls flows into the PN with improved accuracy, outperforming the volume-based approach in terms of inflow regulation, queue management and delays. The framework can be applied in real time to any generic intersection, offering a scalable solution for urban traffic management. This work bridges the gap between perimeter control and market-based intersection auctions, providing a pathway for further research on adaptive traffic management systems.</p></details> |  |

However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |

Deploying interpretable surrogates of uninterpretable policies enhances the safety and verifiability of MARL for real-world applications. However, if these surrogates are to interact directly with the environment within human supervisory frameworks, they must be both performant and computationally efficient. Prior work on interpretable MARL has either sacrificed performance for computational efficiency or computational efficiency for performance. To address this issue, we propose HYDRAVIPER, a decision tree-based interpretable MARL algorithm. HYDRAVIPER coordinates training between agents based on expected team performance, and adaptively allocates budgets for environment interaction to improve computational efficiency. Experiments on standard benchmark environments for multi-agent coordination and traffic signal control show that HYDRAVIPER matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods using a fraction of the runtime, and that it maintains a Pareto frontier of performance for different interaction budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 2 tables; 12 figures; accepted version, published at the 8th AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics and Society (AIES '25)</p></details> |

Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art, outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily, shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload.

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states.

While existing RL-based methods demonstrate effectiveness in reducing vehicular congestion, their predominant focus on vehicle-centric optimization leaves pedestrian mobility needs and safety challenges unaddressed. In this paper, we present a deep RL framework for adaptive control of eight traffic signals along a real-world urban corridor, jointly optimizing both pedestrian and vehicular efficiency. Our single-agent policy is trained using real-world pedestrian and vehicle demand data derived from Wi-Fi logs and video analysis. The results demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional fixed-time signals, reducing average wait times per pedestrian and per vehicle by up to 67% and 52% respectively, while simultaneously decreasing total wait times for both groups by up to 67% and 53%.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers an adaptive method for TSC by responding to dynamic traffic patterns, with multi-agent RL (MARL) gaining traction as intersections naturally function as coordinated agents. However, due to shifts in environmental dynamics, implementing MARL-based TSC policies in the real world often leads to a significant performance drop, known as the sim-to-real gap. Grounded Action Transformation (GAT) has successfully mitigated this gap in single-agent RL for TSC, but real-world traffic networks, which involve numerous interacting intersections, are better suited to a MARL framework. In this work, we introduce JL-GAT, an application of GAT to MARL-based TSC that balances scalability with enhanced grounding capability by incorporating information from neighboring agents. JL-GAT adopts a decentralized approach to GAT, allowing for the scalability often required in real-world traffic networks while still capturing key interactions between agents. Comprehensive experiments on various road networks under simulated adverse weather conditions, along with ablation studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of JL-GAT. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/DaRL-LibSignal/JL-GAT/.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to RLC/RLJ 2025</p></details> |

However, the traditional methods rely on standard graph structures often fail to capture the intricate higher-order spatio-temporal correlations inherent in real-world traffic dynamics. Standard graphs cannot fully represent the spatial relationships within road networks, which limits the effectiveness of graph-based approaches. In contrast, directed hypergraphs provide more accurate representation of spatial information to model complex directed relationships among multiple nodes. In this paper, we propose DHLight, a novel multi-agent policy-based framework that synergistically integrates directed hypergraph learning module. This framework introduces a novel dynamic directed hypergraph construction mechanism, which captures complex and evolving spatio-temporal relationships among intersections in road networks. By leveraging the directed hypergraph relational structure, DHLight empowers agents to achieve adaptive decision-making in traffic signal control. The effectiveness of DHLight is validated against state-of-the-art baselines through extensive experiments in various network datasets.

| **[Chat2SPaT: A Large Language Model Based Tool for Automating Traffic Signal Control Plan Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05283v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT) results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS) software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan. Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300 plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers, serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/yuewangits/Chat2SPaT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Traffic Signal Control based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Case Study on a simulated real-world corridor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02189v4)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies that have formulated multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for adaptive traffic signal control have primarily used value-based RL methods. However, recent literature has shown that policy-based methods may perform better in partially observable environments. Additionally, RL methods remain largely untested for real-world normally signal timing plans because of the simplifying assumptions common in the literature. The current study attempts to address these gaps and formulates a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO) algorithm to implement adaptive and coordinated traffic control along an arterial corridor. The formulated MA-PPO has a centralized-critic architecture under a centralized training and decentralized execution framework. Agents are designed to allow selection and implementation of up to eight signal phases, as commonly implemented in field controllers. The formulated algorithm is tested on a simulated real-world seven intersection corridor. The speed of convergence for each agent was found to depend on the size of the action space, which depends on the number and sequence of signal phases. The performance of the formulated MA-PPO adaptive control algorithm is compared with the field implemented actuated-coordinated signal control (ASC), modeled using PTV-Vissim-MaxTime software in the loop simulation (SILs). The trained MA-PPO performed significantly better than the ASC for all movements. Compared to ASC the MA-PPO showed 2% and 24% improvements in travel time in the primary and secondary coordination directions, respectively. For cross streets movements MA-PPO also showed significant crossing time reductions. Volume sensitivity experiments revealed that the formulated MA-PPO demonstrated good stability, robustness, and adaptability to changes in traffic demand.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Traffic Signal Control via Genetic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17328v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The control of traffic signals is crucial for improving transportation efficiency. Recently, learning-based methods, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), garnered substantial success in the quest for more efficient traffic signal control strategies. However, the design of rewards in DRL highly demands domain knowledge to converge to an effective policy, and the final policy also presents difficulties in terms of explainability. In this work, a new learning-based method for signal control in complex intersections is proposed. In our approach, we design a concept of phase urgency for each signal phase. During signal transitions, the traffic light control strategy selects the next phase to be activated based on the phase urgency. We then proposed to represent the urgency function as an explainable tree structure. The urgency function can calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. Genetic programming is adopted to perform gradient-free optimization of the urgency function. We test our algorithm on multiple public traffic signal control datasets. The experimental results indicate that the tree-shaped urgency function evolved by genetic programming outperforms the baselines, including a state-of-the-art method in the transportation field and a well-known DRL-based method. Our code is available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustness of Reinforcement Learning-Based Traffic Signal Control under Incidents: A Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13836v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning-based traffic signal control (RL-TSC) has emerged as a promising approach for improving urban mobility. However, its robustness under real-world disruptions such as traffic incidents remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce T-REX, an open-source, SUMO-based simulation framework for training and evaluating RL-TSC methods under dynamic, incident scenarios. T-REX models realistic network-level performance considering drivers' probabilistic rerouting, speed adaptation, and contextual lane-changing, enabling the simulation of congestion propagation under incidents. To assess robustness, we propose a suite of metrics that extend beyond conventional traffic efficiency measures. Through extensive experiments across synthetic and real-world networks, we showcase T-REX for the evaluation of several state-of-the-art RL-TSC methods under multiple real-world deployment paradigms. Our findings show that while independent value-based and decentralized pressure-based methods offer fast convergence and generalization in stable traffic conditions and homogeneous networks, their performance degrades sharply under incident-driven distribution shifts. In contrast, hierarchical coordination methods tend to offer more stable and adaptable performance in large-scale, irregular networks, benefiting from their structured decision-making architecture. However, this comes with the trade-off of slower convergence and higher training complexity. These findings highlight the need for robustness-aware design and evaluation in RL-TSC research. T-REX contributes to this effort by providing an open, standardized and reproducible platform for benchmarking RL methods under dynamic and disruptive traffic scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Topology-Assisted Spatio-Temporal Pattern Disentangling for Scalable MARL in Large-scale Autonomous Traffic Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12453v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) have emerged as a promising solution towards ameliorating urban traffic congestion, with Traffic Signal Control (TSC) identified as a critical component. Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms have shown potential in optimizing TSC through real-time decision-making, their scalability and effectiveness often suffer from large-scale and complex environments. Typically, these limitations primarily stem from a fundamental mismatch between the exponential growth of the state space driven by the environmental heterogeneities and the limited modeling capacity of current solutions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel MARL framework that integrates Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), aiming to enhance the expressiveness of environmental representations and improve agent coordination. Furthermore, inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs), a topology-assisted spatial pattern disentangling (TSD)-enhanced MoE is proposed, which leverages topological signatures to decouple graph features for specialized processing, thus improving the model's ability to characterize dynamic and heterogeneous local observations. The TSD module is also integrated into the policy and value networks of the Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, further improving decision-making efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world traffic scenarios, together with comprehensive theoretical analysis, validate the superior performance of the proposed framework, highlighting the model's scalability and effectiveness in addressing the complexities of large-scale TSC tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLMLight: Traffic Signal Control via Vision-Language Meta-Control and Dual-Branch Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19486v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control (TSC) is a core challenge in urban mobility, where real-time decisions must balance efficiency and safety. Existing methods - ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type, motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems, while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1% degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware solution for next-generation traffic signal control.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |
| **[CV-MP: Max-Pressure Control in Heterogeneously Distributed and Partially Connected Vehicle Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05258v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Max-pressure (MP) control has emerged as a prominent real-time network traffic signal control strategy due to its simplicity, decentralized structure, and theoretical guarantees of network queue stability. Meanwhile, advances in connected vehicle (CV) technology have sparked extensive research into CV-based traffic signal control. Despite these developments, few studies have investigated MP control in heterogeneously distributed and partially CV environments while ensuring network queue stability. To address these research gaps, we propose a CV-based MP control (CV-MP) method that leverages real-time CV travel time information to compute the pressure, thereby incorporating both the spatial distribution and temporal delays of vehicles, unlike existing approaches that utilized only spatial distribution or temporal delays. In particular, we establish sufficient conditions for road network queue stability that are compatible with most existing MP control methods. Moreover, we pioneered the proof of network queue stability even if the vehicles are only partially connected and heterogeneously distributed, and gave a necessary condition of CV observation for maintaining the stability. Evaluation results on an Amsterdam corridor show that CV-MP significantly reduces vehicle delays compared to both actuated control and conventional MP control across various CV penetration rates. Moreover, in scenarios with dynamic traffic demand, CV-MP achieves lower spillover peaks even with low and heterogeneous CV penetration rates, further highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce a novel and efficient algorithm for solving the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem, which can be used to model many ITSs applications, such as traffic signal control and vehicle routing. Given the NP-hard nature of the MWIS problem, our proposed algorithm, DynLS, incorporates three key innovations to solve it effectively. First, it uses a scores-based adaptive vertex perturbation (SAVP) technique to accelerate convergence, particularly in sparse graphs. Second, it includes a region location mechanism (RLM) to help escape local optima by dynamically adjusting the search space. Finally, it employs a novel variable neighborhood descent strategy, ComLS, which combines vertex exchange strategies with a reward mechanism to guide the search toward high-quality solutions. Our experimental results demonstrate DynLS's superior performance, consistently delivering high-quality solutions within 1000 seconds. DynLS outperformed five leading algorithms across 360 test instances, achieving the best solution for 350 instances and surpassing the second-best algorithm, Cyclic-Fast, by 177 instances. Moreover, DynLS matched Cyclic-Fast's convergence speed, highlighting its efficiency and practicality. This research represents a significant advancement in heuristic algorithms for the MWIS problem, offering a promising approach to aid AI techniques in optimizing intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05553v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC), enabling multiple intersections to coordinate signal timings in real time. However, in large-scale settings, MARL faces constraints due to extensive data sharing and communication requirements. Federated learning (FL) mitigates these challenges by training shared models without directly exchanging raw data, yet traditional FL methods such as FedAvg struggle with highly heterogeneous intersections. Different intersections exhibit varying traffic patterns, demands, and road structures, so performing FedAvg across all agents is inefficient. To address this gap, we propose Hierarchical Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL) for ATSC. HFRL employs clustering-based or optimization-based techniques to dynamically group intersections and perform FedAvg independently within groups of intersections with similar characteristics, enabling more effective coordination and scalability than standard FedAvg. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world traffic networks demonstrate that HFRL not only outperforms both decentralized and standard federated RL approaches but also identifies suitable grouping patterns based on network structure or traffic demand, resulting in a more robust framework for distributed, heterogeneous systems.</p></details> |  |

Signalized intersections are paramount for optimizing transportation efficiency and enhancing energy economy, as they inherently induce stop and go traffic dynamics. In this paper, we present an integrated framework that concurrently optimizes signal timing and CAV trajectories at signalized intersections, with the dual objectives of maximizing traffic throughput and minimizing energy consumption for CAVs. We first formulate an optimal control strategy for CAVs that prioritizes trajectory planning to circumvent state constraints, while incorporating the impact of signal timing and HDV behavior. Furthermore, we introduce a traffic signal control methodology that dynamically adjusts signal phases based on vehicular density per lane, while mitigating disruption for CAVs scheduled to traverse the intersection. Acknowledging the system's inherent dynamism, we also explore event triggered replanning mechanisms that enable CAVs to iteratively refine their planned trajectories in response to the emergence of more efficient routing options. The efficacy of our proposed framework is evaluated through comprehensive simulations in MATLAB.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance.

Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) algorithms have emerged as a solution by dynamically adjusting signal timing based on real-time traffic conditions. However, the main limitation of such methods is that they are not transferable to environments under real-world constraints, such as balancing efficiency, minimizing collisions, and ensuring fairness across intersections. In this paper, we view the ATSC problem as a constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose a novel algorithm named Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with Lagrange Cost Estimator (MAPPO-LCE) to produce effective traffic signal control policies. Our approach integrates the Lagrange multipliers method to balance rewards and constraints, with a cost estimator for stable adjustment. We also introduce three constraints on the traffic network: GreenTime, GreenSkip, and PhaseSkip, which penalize traffic policies that do not conform to real-world scenarios. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MAPPO-LCE outperforms three baseline MARL algorithms by across all environments and traffic constraints (improving on MAPPO by 12.60%, IPPO by 10.29%, and QTRAN by 13.10%). Our results show that constrained MARL is a valuable tool for traffic planners to deploy scalable and efficient ATSC methods in real-world traffic networks.

However, most of the current traffic state representations are heuristically designed, with insufficient theoretical support. In this paper, we (1) develop a flexible, efficient, and theoretically grounded method, namely generalized phase pressure (G2P) control, which takes only simple lane features into consideration to decide which phase to be actuated; 2) extend the pressure control theory to a general form for multi-homogeneous-lane road networks based on queueing theory; (3) design a new traffic state representation based on the generalized phase state features from G2P control; and 4) develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm template named G2P-XLight, and two RL algorithms, G2P-MPLight and G2P-CoLight, by combining the generalized phase state representation with MPLight and CoLight, two well-performed RL methods for learning traffic signal control policies. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that G2P control outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) heuristic method in the transportation field and other recent human-designed heuristic methods; and that the newly proposed G2P-XLight significantly outperforms SOTA learning-based approaches.

An integral part of traffic management is understanding the turning movement counts (TMCs) at intersections, Accurate TMCs at intersections are crucial for traffic signal control, congestion mitigation, and road safety. In general, TMCs are obtained using physical sensors installed at intersections, but this approach can be cost-prohibitive and technically challenging, especially for cities with extensive road networks. Recent advancements in machine learning and data-driven approaches have offered promising alternatives for estimating TMCs. Traffic patterns can vary significantly across different intersections due to factors such as road geometry, traffic signal settings, and local driver behaviors. This domain discrepancy limits the generalizability and accuracy of machine learning models when applied to new or unseen intersections. In response to these limitations, this research proposes a novel framework leveraging domain adaptation (DA) to estimate TMCs at intersections by using traffic controller event-based data, road infrastructure data, and point-of-interest (POI) data. Evaluated on 30 intersections in Tucson, Arizona, the performance of the proposed DA framework was compared with state-of-the-art models and achieved the lowest values in terms of Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2412.09861</p></details> |

The burgeoning field of intelligent transportation systems, bolstered by artificial intelligence techniques and extensive data availability, offers new prospects for the implementation of ATSC. In this study, we introduce a parallel hybrid action space reinforcement learning model (PH-DDPG) that optimizes traffic signal phase and duration of traffic signals simultaneously, eliminating the need for sequential decision-making seen in traditional two-stage models.

We introduce OffLight, a novel offline MARL framework designed to handle heterogeneous behavior policies in TSC datasets. To improve learning efficiency, OffLight incorporates Importance Sampling (IS) to correct for distributional shifts and Return-Based Prioritized Sampling (RBPS) to focus on high-quality experiences. OffLight utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Variational Graph Autoencoder (GMM-VGAE) to capture the diverse distribution of behavior policies from local observations. Extensive experiments across real-world urban traffic scenarios show that OffLight outperforms existing offline RL methods, achieving up to a 7.8% reduction in average travel time and 11.2% decrease in queue length. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of OffLight's components in handling heterogeneous data and improving policy performance. These results highlight OffLight's scalability and potential to improve urban traffic management without the risks of online learning.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in parameter-sharing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have greatly enhanced the scalable and adaptive optimization of complex, dynamic flows in large-scale homogeneous networks. However, the inherent heterogeneity of real-world traffic networks, with their varied intersection topologies and interaction dynamics, poses substantial challenges to achieving scalable and effective ATSC across different traffic scenarios. To address these challenges, we present Unicorn, a universal and collaborative MARL framework designed for efficient and adaptable network-wide ATSC. Specifically, we first propose a unified approach to map the states and actions of intersections with varying topologies into a common structure based on traffic movements. Next, we design a Universal Traffic Representation (UTR) module with a decoder-only network for general feature extraction, enhancing the model's adaptability to diverse traffic scenarios. Additionally, we incorporate an Intersection Specifics Representation (ISR) module, designed to identify key latent vectors that represent the unique intersection's topology and traffic dynamics through variational inference techniques. To further refine these latent representations, we employ a contrastive learning approach in a self-supervised manner, which enables better differentiation of intersection-specific features. Moreover, we integrate the state-action dependencies of neighboring agents into policy optimization, which effectively captures dynamic agent interactions and facilitates efficient regional collaboration. Our results show that Unicorn outperforms other methods across various evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential in complex, dynamic traffic networks.</p></details> |  |

Within a model predictive control (MPC) framework, control policies consist of an algorithm that estimates parameters and a one-step MPC that computes control inputs using estimated parameters. The algorithm switches between different terminal sets of the MPC to explore different regions of the state space, where different parameters are identifiable. The one-step MPC minimizes a cost that approximates the sum of squares of all the queue lengths within a constant and does not require demand information. We show that the algorithm can estimate parameters exactly in finite time, and the one-step MPC renders maximum throughput in terms of input-to-state practical stability. Simulations indicate better transient performance regarding queue lengths under our proposed policies than existing ones.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Large-scale Regional Traffic Signal Control Based on Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09252v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of global urbanization and motorization, traffic congestion has become a significant issue, severely affecting the quality of life, environment, and economy. This paper puts forward a single-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based regional traffic signal control (TSC) model. Different from multi - agent systems, this model can coordinate traffic signals across a large area, with the goals of alleviating regional traffic congestion and minimizing the total travel time. The TSC environment is precisely defined through specific state space, action space, and reward functions. The state space consists of the current congestion state, which is represented by the queue lengths of each link, and the current signal phase scheme of intersections. The action space is designed to select an intersection first and then adjust its phase split. Two reward functions are meticulously crafted. One focuses on alleviating congestion and the other aims to minimize the total travel time while considering the congestion level. The experiments are carried out with the SUMO traffic simulation software. The performance of the TSC model is evaluated by comparing it with a base case where no signal-timing adjustments are made. The results show that the model can effectively control congestion. For example, the queuing length is significantly reduced in the scenarios tested. Moreover, when the reward is set to both alleviate congestion and minimize the total travel time, the average travel time is remarkably decreased, which indicates that the model can effectively improve traffic conditions. This research provides a new approach for large-scale regional traffic signal control and offers valuable insights for future urban traffic management.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2503.02279</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Traffic Signal Control through Model-based Reinforcement Learning and Policy Reuse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08728v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown significant potential in traffic signal control (TSC). However, current MARL-based methods often suffer from insufficient generalization due to the fixed traffic patterns and road network conditions used during training. This limitation results in poor adaptability to new traffic scenarios, leading to high retraining costs and complex deployment. To address this challenge, we propose two algorithms: PLight and PRLight. PLight employs a model-based reinforcement learning approach, pretraining control policies and environment models using predefined source-domain traffic scenarios. The environment model predicts the state transitions, which facilitates the comparison of environmental features. PRLight further enhances adaptability by adaptively selecting pre-trained PLight agents based on the similarity between the source and target domains to accelerate the learning process in the target domain. We evaluated the algorithms through two transfer settings: (1) adaptability to different traffic scenarios within the same road network, and (2) generalization across different road networks. The results show that PRLight significantly reduces the adaptation time compared to learning from scratch in new TSC scenarios, achieving optimal performance using similarities between available and target scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using a single actor to output personalized policy for different intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07678v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, with the development of Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) has achieved satisfactory results. In traffic scenarios with multiple intersections, MARL treats each intersection as an agent and optimizes traffic signal control strategies through learning and real-time decision-making. Considering that observation distributions of intersections might be different in real-world scenarios, shared parameter methods might lack diversity and thus lead to high generalization requirements in the shared-policy network. A typical solution is to increase the size of network parameters. However, simply increasing the scale of the network does not necessarily improve policy generalization, which is validated in our experiments. Accordingly, an approach that considers both the personalization of intersections and the efficiency of parameter sharing is required. To this end, we propose Hyper-Action Multi-Head Proximal Policy Optimization (HAMH-PPO), a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL method that utilizes a shared PPO policy network to deliver personalized policies for intersections with non-iid observation distributions. The centralized critic in HAMH-PPO uses graph attention units to calculate the graph representations of all intersections and outputs a set of value estimates with multiple output heads for each intersection. The decentralized execution actor takes the local observation history as input and output distributions of action as well as a so-called hyper-action to balance the multiple values estimated from the centralized critic to further guide the updating of TSC policies. The combination of hyper-action and multi-head values enables multiple agents to share a single actor-critic while achieving personalized policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[A CAV-based perimeter-free regional traffic control strategy utilizing existing parking infrastructure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04620v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel perimeter-free regional traffic management strategy for traffic networks under a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) environment. The proposed strategy requires CAVs, especially those with long remaining travel distances, to temporarily wait at nearby parking facilities when the network is congested. After a designated holding time, these CAVs are allowed to re-enter the network. Doing so helps reduce congestion and improve overall operational efficiency. Unlike traditional perimeter control approaches that restrict inflows to congested regions, the proposed holding strategy leverages existing parking infrastructure to temporarily hold vehicles in a way that partially avoids local queue accumulation issues. The proposed method can be easily integrated with existing signal control methods and retains the maximum stability property of the original traffic signal control methods. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy not only reduces travel time for vehicles that are not held, but can also reduce travel times for some of the held vehicles as well, which serves as another key merit of the proposed approach. Compared to the two benchmark perimeter control algorithms, the proposed strategy is more robust against demand patterns and generates stronger improvements in the operational efficiency. Importantly, since the proposed strategy requires existing parking infrastructure, its performance has been demonstrated under various configurations of parking locations and capacities. Particularly, it is demonstrated that the utilization of the parking facility consistently improves overall traffic efficiency, regardless of the facility's size. Lastly, the proposed strategy is shown to be beneficial in a partial CAV environment where only a subset of vehicles are available for holding.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamerV3 for Traffic Signal Control: Hyperparameter Tuning and Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02279v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has evolved into a widely investigated technology for the development of smart TSC strategies. However, current RL algorithms necessitate excessive interaction with the environment to learn effective policies, making them impractical for large-scale tasks. The DreamerV3 algorithm presents compelling properties for policy learning. It summarizes general dynamics knowledge about the environment and enables the prediction of future outcomes of potential actions from past experience, reducing the interaction with the environment through imagination training. In this paper, a corridor TSC model is trained using the DreamerV3 algorithm to explore the benefits of world models for TSC strategy learning. In RL environment design, to manage congestion levels effectively, both the state and reward functions are defined based on queue length, and the action is designed to manage queue length efficiently. Using the SUMO simulation platform, the two hyperparameters (training ratio and model size) of the DreamerV3 algorithm were tuned and analyzed across different OD matrix scenarios. We discovered that choosing a smaller model size and initially attempting several medium training ratios can significantly reduce the time spent on hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we found that the approach is generally applicable as it can solve two TSC task scenarios with the same hyperparameters. Regarding the claimed data-efficiency of the DreamerV3 algorithm, due to the significant fluctuation of the episode reward curve in the early stages of training, it can only be confirmed that larger model sizes exhibit modest data-efficiency, and no evidence was found that increasing the training ratio accelerates convergence.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Toward Dependency Dynamics in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16608v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) emerges as a promising data-driven approach for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) in complex urban traffic networks, with deep neural networks substantially augmenting its learning capabilities. However, centralized RL becomes impractical for ATSC involving multiple agents due to the exceedingly high dimensionality of the joint action space. Multi-agent RL (MARL) mitigates this scalability issue by decentralizing control to local RL agents. Nevertheless, this decentralized method introduces new challenges: the environment becomes partially observable from the perspective of each local agent due to constrained inter-agent communication. Both centralized RL and MARL exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses, particularly under heavy intersectional traffic conditions. In this paper, we justify that MARL can achieve the optimal global Q-value by separating into multiple IRL (Independent Reinforcement Learning) processes when no spill-back congestion occurs (no agent dependency) among agents (intersections). In the presence of spill-back congestion (with agent dependency), the maximum global Q-value can be achieved by using centralized RL. Building upon the conclusions, we propose a novel Dynamic Parameter Update Strategy for Deep Q-Network (DQN-DPUS), which updates the weights and bias based on the dependency dynamics among agents, i.e. updating only the diagonal sub-matrices for the scenario without spill-back congestion. We validate the DQN-DPUS in a simple network with two intersections under varying traffic, and show that the proposed strategy can speed up the convergence rate without sacrificing optimal exploration. The results corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the efficacy of DQN-DPUS in optimizing traffic signal control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communication Strategy on Macro-and-Micro Traffic State in Cooperative Deep Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13248v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) has become a popular research topic in intelligent transportation systems. Regional Traffic Signal Control (RTSC) using the Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) technique has become a promising approach for ATSC due to its ability to achieve the optimum trade-off between scalability and optimality. Most existing RTSC approaches partition a traffic network into several disjoint regions, followed by applying centralized reinforcement learning techniques to each region. However, the pursuit of cooperation among RTSC agents still remains an open issue and no communication strategy for RTSC agents has been investigated. In this paper, we propose communication strategies to capture the correlation of micro-traffic states among lanes and the correlation of macro-traffic states among intersections. We first justify the evolution equation of the RTSC process is Markovian via a system of store-and-forward queues. Next, based on the evolution equation, we propose two GAT-Aggregated (GA2) communication modules--GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug to extract both intra-region and inter-region correlations between macro and micro traffic states. While GA2-Naive only considers the movements at each intersection, GA2-Aug also considers the lane-changing behavior of vehicles. Two proposed communication modules are then aggregated into two existing novel RTSC frameworks--RegionLight and Regional-DRL. Experimental results demonstrate that both GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug effectively improve the performance of existing RTSC frameworks under both real and synthetic scenarios. Hyperparameter testing also reveals the robustness and potential of our communication modules in large-scale traffic networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FitLight: Federated Imitation Learning for Plug-and-Play Autonomous Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11937v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Traffic Signal Control (TSC) methods have been extensively studied, their practical applications still raise some serious issues such as high learning cost and poor generalizability. This is because the ``trial-and-error'' training style makes RL agents extremely dependent on the specific traffic environment, which also requires a long convergence time. To address these issues, we propose a novel Federated Imitation Learning (FIL)-based framework for multi-intersection TSC, named FitLight, which allows RL agents to plug-and-play for any traffic environment without additional pre-training cost. Unlike existing imitation learning approaches that rely on pre-training RL agents with demonstrations, FitLight allows real-time imitation learning and seamless transition to reinforcement learning. Due to our proposed knowledge-sharing mechanism and novel hybrid pressure-based agent design, RL agents can quickly find a best control policy with only a few episodes. Moreover, for resource-constrained TSC scenarios, FitLight supports model pruning and heterogeneous model aggregation, such that RL agents can work on a micro-controller with merely 16{\it KB} RAM and 32{\it KB} ROM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, FitLight not only provides a superior starting point but also converges to a better final solution on both real-world and synthetic datasets, even under extreme resource limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-hop Upstream Anticipatory Traffic Signal Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07271v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordination in traffic signal control is crucial for managing congestion in urban networks. Existing pressure-based control methods focus only on immediate upstream links, leading to suboptimal green time allocation and increased network delays. However, effective signal control inherently requires coordination across a broader spatial scope, as the effect of upstream traffic should influence signal control decisions at downstream intersections, impacting a large area in the traffic network. Although agent communication using neural network-based feature extraction can implicitly enhance spatial awareness, it significantly increases the learning complexity, adding an additional layer of difficulty to the challenging task of control in deep reinforcement learning. To address the issue of learning complexity and myopic traffic pressure definition, our work introduces a novel concept based on Markov chain theory, namely \textit{multi-hop upstream pressure}, which generalizes the conventional pressure to account for traffic conditions beyond the immediate upstream links. This farsighted and compact metric informs the deep reinforcement learning agent to preemptively clear the multi-hop upstream queues, guiding the agent to optimize signal timings with a broader spatial awareness. Simulations on synthetic and realistic (Toronto) scenarios demonstrate controllers utilizing multi-hop upstream pressure significantly reduce overall network delay by prioritizing traffic movements based on a broader understanding of upstream congestion.</p></details> | 5 tables, 11 figures |
| **[AMM: Adaptive Modularized Reinforcement Model for Multi-city Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02548v1)** | 2025-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control (TSC) is an important and widely studied direction. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been used to solve TSC problems and achieve superior performance over conventional TSC methods. However, applying RL methods to the real world is challenging due to the huge cost of experiments in real-world traffic environments. One possible solution is TSC domain adaptation, which adapts trained models to target environments and reduces the number of interactions and the training cost. However, existing TSC domain adaptation methods still face two major issues: the lack of consideration for differences across cities and the low utilization of multi-city data. To solve aforementioned issues, we propose an approach named Adaptive Modularized Model (AMM). By modularizing TSC problems and network models, we overcome the challenge of possible changes in environmental observations. We also aggregate multi-city experience through meta-learning. We conduct extensive experiments on different cities and show that AMM can achieve excellent performance with limited interactions in target environments and outperform existing methods. We also demonstrate the feasibility and generalizability of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Testing Stationarity and Change Point Detection in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01707v4)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods in possibly nonstationary environments. Many existing RL algorithms in the literature rely on the stationarity assumption that requires the system transition and the reward function to be constant over time. However, the stationarity assumption is restrictive in practice and is likely to be violated in a number of applications, including traffic signal control, robotics and mobile health. In this paper, we develop a consistent procedure to test the nonstationarity of the optimal Q-function based on pre-collected historical data, without additional online data collection. Based on the proposed test, we further develop a sequential change point detection method that can be naturally coupled with existing state-of-the-art RL methods for policy optimization in nonstationary environments. The usefulness of our method is illustrated by theoretical results, simulation studies, and a real data example from the 2018 Intern Health Study. A Python implementation of the proposed procedure is available at https://github.com/limengbinggz/CUSUM-RL.</p></details> |  |

Using real-time data from various sensors, the system anticipates traffic fluctuations and dynamically adjusts signal phase durations to minimize delays and improve traffic flow. This proactive adjustment, supported by algorithms inspired by simulated annealing and reinforcement learning, also enhances energy efficiency, reduces pollutant emissions, and responds effectively to unexpected events (adverse weather, accidents, or temporary gatherings). Preliminary simulations conducted in a realistic urban environment demonstrate a significant reduction in average waiting times. Future developments include incorporating data from connected vehicles, integrating new modes of transport, and continuously refining predictive models to address the growing challenges of urban mobility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Critique-Tune-Based Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Pressure for Multi-Intersection Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16225v2)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) system is a critical component of intelligent transportation, with the capability to significantly alleviate urban traffic congestion. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have demonstrated promising performance in achieving ATSC, existing methods are still prone to making unreasonable policies. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Critique-Tune-Based Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Pressure for multi-intersection signal control (BCT-APLight). In BCT-APLight, the Critique-Tune (CT) framework, a two-layer Bayesian structure is designed to refine the excessive trust of RL policies. Specifically, the Bayesian inference-based Critique Layer provides effective evaluations of the credibility of policies; the Bayesian decision-based Tune Layer fine-tunes policies by minimizing the posterior risks when the evaluations are negative. Meanwhile, an attention-based Adaptive Pressure (AP) mechanism is designed to effectively weight the vehicle queues in each lane, thereby enhancing the rationality of traffic movement representation within the network. Equipped with the CT framework and AP mechanism, BCT-APLight effectively enhances the reasonableness of RL policies. Extensive experiments conducted with a simulator across a range of intersection layouts demonstrate that BCT-APLight is superior to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on seven real-world datasets. Specifically, BCT-APLight decreases average queue length by \textbf{\(\boldsymbol{9.60\%}\)} and average waiting time by \textbf{\(\boldsymbol{15.28\%}\)}.</p></details> |  |

Current SOTA methods model road networks as topological graph structures, incorporate graph attention into deep Q-learning, and merge local and global embeddings to improve policy. However, graph-based methods are difficult to parallelize, resulting in huge time overhead. Moreover, none of the current peer studies have deployed dynamic traffic systems for experiments, which is far from the actual situation. In this context, we propose Multi-Scene Aggregation Convolutional Learning for traffic signal control (MacLight), which offers faster training speeds and more stable performance. Our approach consists of two main components. The first is the global representation, where we utilize variational autoencoders to compactly compress and extract the global representation. The second component employs the proximal policy optimization algorithm as the backbone, allowing value evaluation to consider both local features and global embedding representations. This backbone model significantly reduces time overhead and ensures stability in policy updates. We validated our method across multiple traffic scenarios under both static and dynamic traffic systems. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to general and domian SOTA methods, our approach achieves superior stability, optimized convergence levels and the highest time efficiency.

However, existing methods often struggle to generalize beyond their training environments to unseen scenarios with varying traffic dynamics. We present TransferLight, a novel framework designed for robust generalization across road-networks, diverse traffic conditions and intersection geometries. At its core, we propose a log-distance reward function, offering spatially-aware signal prioritization while remaining adaptable to varied lane configurations - overcoming the limitations of traditional pressure-based rewards. Our hierarchical, heterogeneous, and directed graph neural network architecture effectively captures granular traffic dynamics, enabling transferability to arbitrary intersection layouts. Using a decentralized multi-agent approach, global rewards, and novel state transition priors, we develop a single, weight-tied policy that scales zero-shot to any road network without re-training. Through domain randomization during training, we additionally enhance generalization capabilities. Experimental results validate TransferLight's superior performance in unseen scenarios, advancing practical, generalizable intelligent transportation systems to meet evolving urban traffic demands.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI Workshop Paper (MALTA)</p></details> |

Traditional TSC methods, primarily based on transportation engineering and reinforcement learning (RL), often struggle with generalization abilities across varied traffic scenarios and lack interpretability. This paper presents LLMLight, a novel framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) as decision-making agents for TSC. Specifically, the framework begins by instructing the LLM with a knowledgeable prompt detailing real-time traffic conditions. Leveraging the advanced generalization capabilities of LLMs, LLMLight engages a reasoning and decision-making process akin to human intuition for effective traffic control. Moreover, we build LightGPT, a specialized backbone LLM tailored for TSC tasks. By learning nuanced traffic patterns and control strategies, LightGPT enhances the LLMLight framework cost-effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-world and synthetic datasets, along with evaluations by fifteen human experts, demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness, generalization ability, and interpretability of LLMLight with LightGPT, outperforming nine baseline methods and ten advanced LLMs.</p></details> |  |

An integral part of traffic management is understanding the turning movement counts (TMCs) at intersections, Accurate TMCs at intersections are crucial for traffic signal control, congestion mitigation, and road safety. In general, TMCs are obtained using physical sensors installed at intersections, but this approach can be cost-prohibitive and technically challenging, especially for cities with extensive road networks. Recent advancements in machine learning and data-driven approaches have offered promising alternatives for estimating TMCs. Traffic patterns can vary significantly across different intersections due to factors such as road geometry, traffic signal settings, and local driver behaviors. This domain discrepancy limits the generalizability and accuracy of machine learning models when applied to new or unseen intersections. In response to these limitations, this research proposes a novel framework leveraging transfer learning (TL) to estimate TMCs at intersections by using traffic controller event-based data, road infrastructure data, and point-of-interest (POI) data. Evaluated on 30 intersections in Tucson, Arizona, the performance of the proposed TL model was compared with eight state-of-the-art regression models and achieved the lowest values in terms of Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces an intersection-aware emergency medical service (EMS) accessibility model to evaluate and improve EMV travel times across NYC. Integrating intersection density metrics, road network characteristics, and demographic data, the model identifies vulnerable regions with inadequate EMS coverage. The analysis reveals that densely interconnected areas, such as parts of Staten Island, Queens, and Manhattan, experience significant accessibility deficits due to intersection delays and sparse medical infrastructure. To address these challenges, this study explores the adoption of EMVLight, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, which demonstrates the potential to reduce intersection delays by 50\%, increasing EMS accessibility to 95\% of NYC residents within the critical benchmark of 4 minutes. Results indicate that advanced traffic signal control (TSC) systems can alleviate congestion-induced delays while improving equity in emergency response. The findings provide actionable insights for urban planning and policy interventions to enhance EMS accessibility and ensure timely care for underserved populations.</p></details> |  |

The first part of the study develops adaptive signal control based on MARL for a pair of coordinated intersections in a microscopic simulation environment. The two agents, one for each intersection, are centrally trained using a value decomposition network (VDN) architecture. The trained agents show slightly better performance compared to coordinated actuated signal control based on overall intersection delay at v/c of 0.95. In the second part of the study the trained signal control agents are used as background signal controllers while developing event-based TSP agents. In one variation, independent TSP agents are formulated and trained under a decentralized training and decentralized execution (DTDE) framework to implement TSP at each intersection. In the second variation, the two TSP agents are centrally trained under a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework and VDN architecture to select and implement coordinated TSP strategies across the two intersections. In both cases the agents converge to the same bus delay value, but independent agents show high instability throughout the training process. For the test runs, the two independent agents reduce bus delay across the two intersections by 22% compared to the no TSP case while the coordinated TSP agents achieve 27% delay reduction. In both cases, there is only a slight increase in delay for a majority of the side street movements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Traffic Signal Control using High-Dimensional State Representation and Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07759v1)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reinforcement learning-based (RL-based) traffic signal control (TSC), decisions on the signal timing are made based on the available information on vehicles at a road intersection. This forms the state representation for the RL environment which can either be high-dimensional containing several variables or a low-dimensional vector. Current studies suggest that using high dimensional state representations does not lead to improved performance on TSC. However, we argue, with experimental results, that the use of high dimensional state representations can, in fact, lead to improved TSC performance with improvements up to 17.9% of the average waiting time. This high-dimensional representation is obtainable using the cost-effective vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, encouraging its adoption for TSC. Additionally, given the large size of the state, we identified the need to have computational efficient models and explored model compression via pruning.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Learning to Control and Coordinate Mixed Traffic Through Robot Vehicles at Complex and Unsignalized Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05294v4)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intersections are essential road infrastructures for traffic in modern metropolises. However, they can also be the bottleneck of traffic flows as a result of traffic incidents or the absence of traffic coordination mechanisms such as traffic lights. Recently, various control and coordination mechanisms that are beyond traditional control methods have been proposed to improve the efficiency of intersection traffic by leveraging the ability of autonomous vehicles. Amongst these methods, the control of foreseeable mixed traffic that consists of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and robot vehicles (RVs) has emerged. We propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for the control and coordination of mixed traffic by RVs at real-world, complex intersections -- an open challenge to date. We design comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness, robustness, generalizablility, and adaptability of our approach. In particular, our method can prevent congestion formation via merely 5% RVs under a real-world traffic demand of 700 vehicles per hour. In contrast, without RVs, congestion will form when the traffic demand reaches as low as 200 vehicles per hour. Moreover, when the RV penetration rate exceeds 60%, our method starts to outperform traffic signal control in terms of the average waiting time of all vehicles. Our method is not only robust against blackout events, sudden RV percentage drops, and V2V communication error, but also enjoys excellent generalizablility, evidenced by its successful deployment in five unseen intersections. Lastly, our method performs well under various traffic rules, demonstrating its adaptability to diverse scenarios.

| **[DiffLight: A Partial Rewards Conditioned Diffusion Model for Traffic Signal Control with Missing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22938v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of reinforcement learning in traffic signal control (TSC) has been extensively researched and yielded notable achievements. However, most existing works for TSC assume that traffic data from all surrounding intersections is fully and continuously available through sensors. In real-world applications, this assumption often fails due to sensor malfunctions or data loss, making TSC with missing data a critical challenge. To meet the needs of practical applications, we introduce DiffLight, a novel conditional diffusion model for TSC under data-missing scenarios in the offline setting. Specifically, we integrate two essential sub-tasks, i.e., traffic data imputation and decision-making, by leveraging a Partial Rewards Conditioned Diffusion (PRCD) model to prevent missing rewards from interfering with the learning process. Meanwhile, to effectively capture the spatial-temporal dependencies among intersections, we design a Spatial-Temporal transFormer (STFormer) architecture. In addition, we propose a Diffusion Communication Mechanism (DCM) to promote better communication and control performance under data-missing scenarios. Extensive experiments on five datasets with various data-missing scenarios demonstrate that DiffLight is an effective controller to address TSC with missing data. The code of DiffLight is released at https://github.com/lokol5579/DiffLight-release.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

One promising solution to tackle this problem is intelligent traffic signal control (TSC). Recently, TSC strategies leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) have garnered attention among researchers. However, the evaluation of these models has primarily relied on fixed metrics like reward and queue length. This limited evaluation approach provides only a narrow view of the model's decision-making process, impeding its practical implementation. Moreover, effective TSC necessitates coordinated actions across multiple intersections. Existing visual analysis solutions fall short when applied in multi-agent settings. In this study, we delve into the challenge of interpretability in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), particularly within the context of TSC. We propose MARLens a visual analytics system tailored to understand MARL-based TSC. Our system serves as a versatile platform for both RL and TSC researchers. It empowers them to explore the model's features from various perspectives, revealing its decision-making processes and shedding light on interactions among different agents. To facilitate quick identification of critical states, we have devised multiple visualization views, complemented by a traffic simulation module that allows users to replay specific training scenarios. To validate the utility of our proposed system, we present three comprehensive case studies, incorporate insights from domain experts through interviews, and conduct a user study. These collective efforts underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of MARLens in enhancing our understanding of MARL-based TSC systems and pave the way for more informed and efficient traffic management strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures; Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 2024</p></details> |

Learning-based optimization methods require extensive interactions with highly realistic microscopic traffic simulators. However, existing microscopic traffic simulators are inefficient in large-scale scenarios and thus fail to support the adoption of these methods in large-scale transportation system optimization scenarios. In addition, the optimization scenarios supported by existing simulators are limited, mainly focusing on the traffic signal control. To address these challenges, we propose the first open-source GPU-accelerated large-scale microscopic simulator for transportation system simulation and optimization. The simulator can iterate at 84.09Hz, which achieves 88.92 times computational acceleration in the large-scale scenario with 2,464,950 vehicles compared to the best baseline CityFlow. Besides, it achieves a more realistic average road speeds simulated on real datasets by adopting the IDM model as the car-following model and the randomized MOBIL model as the lane-changing model. Based on it, we implement a set of microscopic and macroscopic controllable objects and metrics provided by Python API to support typical transportation system optimization scenarios. We choose five representative scenarios and benchmark classical rule-based algorithms, reinforcement learning algorithms, and black-box optimization algorithms in four cities. These experiments effectively demonstrate the usability of the simulator for large-scale traffic system optimization.

However, in current decades, it continues to pose significant challenges in managing large-scale traffic networks, coordinating intersections, and ensuring robustness under uncertain traffic conditions. This paper presents a scalable multi-objective optimization approach for robust traffic signal control in dynamic and uncertain urban environments. A multi-objective optimization model is proposed in this paper, which incorporates stochastic variables and probabilistic traffic patterns to capture traffic flow dynamics and uncertainty. We propose an algorithm named Adaptive Hybrid Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithm (AHMOA), which addresses the uncertainties of city traffic, including network-wide signal coordination, fluctuating patterns, and environmental impacts. AHMOA simultaneously optimizes multiple objectives, such as average delay, network stability, and system robustness, while adapting to unpredictable changes in traffic. The algorithm combines evolutionary strategies with an adaptive mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation, and incorporates a memory-based evaluation mechanism to leverage historical traffic data. Simulations are conducted in different cities including Manhattan, Paris, Sao Paulo, and Istanbul. The experimental results demonstrate that AHMOA consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms and the algorithm is competent to provide scalable, robust Pareto optimal solutions for managing complex traffic systems under uncertain environments.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

However, the complexity of traffic networks has rendered traditional machine learning and statistical methods less effective. With the advent of artificial intelligence, deep learning frameworks have achieved remarkable progress across various fields and are now considered highly effective in many areas. Since 2019, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a particularly promising deep learning approach within the ITS domain, owing to their robust ability to model graph-structured data and address complex problems. Consequently, there has been increasing scholarly attention to the applications of GNNs in transportation, which have demonstrated excellent performance. Nevertheless, current research predominantly focuses on traffic forecasting, with other ITS domains, such as autonomous vehicles and demand prediction, receiving less attention. This paper aims to review the applications of GNNs across six representative and emerging ITS research areas: traffic forecasting, vehicle control system, traffic signal control, transportation safety, demand prediction, and parking management. We have examined a wide range of graph-related studies from 2018 to 2023, summarizing their methodologies, features, and contributions in detailed tables and lists. Additionally, we identify the challenges of applying GNNs in ITS and propose potential future research directions.</p></details> |  |

While numerous studies have addressed the issue of intelligent traffic systems in the context of various disturbances, traffic signal malfunction, a common real-world occurrence with significant repercussions, has received comparatively limited attention. The primary objective of this research is to mitigate the adverse effects of traffic signal malfunction, such as traffic congestion and collision, by optimizing the control of neighboring functioning signals. To achieve this goal, this paper presents a novel traffic signal control framework (MalLight), which leverages an Influence-aware State Aggregation Module (ISAM) and an Influence-aware Reward Aggregation Module (IRAM) to achieve coordinated control of surrounding traffic signals. To the best of our knowledge, this study pioneers the application of a Reinforcement Learning(RL)-based approach to address the challenges posed by traffic signal malfunction.

As an alternative, optimizing existing traffic management systems, particularly through adaptive traffic signal control, offers a promising solution. This paper explores the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance traffic signal operations at intersections, aiming to reduce congestion without extensive sensor networks. We introduce two RL-based algorithms: a turn-based agent, which dynamically prioritizes traffic signals based on real-time queue lengths, and a time-based agent, which adjusts signal phase durations according to traffic conditions while following a fixed phase cycle. By representing the state as a scalar queue length, our approach simplifies the learning process and lowers deployment costs. The algorithms were tested in four distinct traffic scenarios using seven evaluation metrics to comprehensively assess performance. Simulation results demonstrate that both RL algorithms significantly outperform conventional traffic signal control systems, highlighting their potential to improve urban traffic flow efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Traditional forecasting methods, however, struggle with the irregular traffic time series resulting from adaptive traffic signal controls, presenting challenges in asynchronous spatial dependency, irregular temporal dependency, and predicting variable-length sequences. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) tailored for irregular traffic time series forecasting. Specifically, we first propose an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to capture the spatial dependency between asynchronously measured traffic states regulated by adaptive traffic signals. After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state sequences, a personalized time encoding is devised to embed the continuous time signals. Then, we propose a Transformable Time-aware Convolution Network, which adapts meta-filters for time-aware convolution on the sequences with inconsistent temporal flow. Additionally, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network, comprising a state evolution unit and a semi-autoregressive predictor, is designed to predict variable-length traffic sequences effectively and efficiently. Extensive experiments on a newly established benchmark demonstrate the superiority of ASeer compared with twelve competitive baselines across six metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in the research track of KDD 2024</p></details> |

However, MP-based signal control algorithms do not differentiate the movement of transit vehicles from private vehicles or between high and single-occupancy private vehicles. Prioritizing the movement of transit or other high occupancy vehicles (HOVs) is vital to reduce congestion and improve the reliability and efficiency of transit operations. This study proposes OCC-MP: a novel MP-based algorithm that considers both vehicle queues and passenger occupancies in computing the weights of movements. By weighing movements with higher passenger occupancies more heavily, transit and other HOVs are implicitly provided with priority, while accounting for any negative impacts of that priority on single occupancy vehicles. And, unlike rule-based transit signal priority (TSP) strategies, OCC-MP more naturally also accommodates conflicting transit routes at a signalized intersection and facilitates their movement, even in mixed traffic without dedicated lanes. Simulations on a grid network under varying demands and transit configurations demonstrate the effectiveness of OCC-MP at providing TSP while simultaneously reducing the negative impact imparted onto lower occupancy private vehicles. Furthermore, OCC-MP is shown to have a larger stable region for demand compared to rule-based TSP strategies integrated into the MP framework. The performance of OCC-MP is also shown to be robust to errors in passenger occupancy information from transit vehicles and can be applied when passenger occupancies of private vehicles are not available. Finally, OCC-MP can be applied in a partially connected vehicle (CV) environment when a subset of vehicles is able to provide information to the signal controller, outperforming baseline methods at low CV penetration rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will be published in Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies</p></details> |

The RL agent directly determines the duration of the next phase in a pre-defined sequence. Before the RL agent's decision is executed, we use the shock wave theory to estimate queue expansion at the designated movement allowed for re-service and decide if phase re-service is necessary. If necessary, a temporary phase re-service is inserted before the next regular phase. We formulate the RL problem as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) and solve it with proximal policy optimization (PPO). We conducted a series of experiments that showed significant improvements thanks to the introduction of phase re-service. Vehicle delays are reduced by up to 29.95% of the average and up to 59.21% of the standard deviation. The number of stops is reduced by 26.05% on average with 45.77% less standard deviation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ITSC 2024</p></details> |

The proposed approach aims to enhance control strategies at intersections while simultaneously addressing safety, efficiency, and decarbonization objectives. Traditional ATSC methods typically prioritize traffic efficiency and often struggle to adapt to real-time dynamic traffic conditions. To address these challenges, the study suggests a DRL-based ATSC algorithm that incorporates the Dueling Double Deep Q Network (D3QN) framework. The performance of this algorithm is assessed using a simulated intersection in Changsha, China. Notably, the proposed ATSC algorithm surpasses both traditional ATSC and ATSC algorithms focused solely on efficiency optimization by achieving over a 16% reduction in traffic conflicts and a 4% decrease in carbon emissions. Regarding traffic efficiency, waiting time is reduced by 18% compared to traditional ATSC, albeit showing a slight increase (0.64%) compared to the DRL-based ATSC algorithm integrating the D3QN framework. This marginal increase suggests a trade-off between efficiency and other objectives like safety and decarbonization. Additionally, the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance, particularly in scenarios with high traffic demand, across all three objectives. These findings contribute to advancing traffic control systems by offering a practical and effective solution for optimizing signal control strategies in real-world traffic situations.</p></details> |  |

This study extends RL - based traffic control to include TSP. Using a microscopic simulation environment and connected vehicle data, the study develops and tests a TSP event-based RL agent that assumes control from another developed RL - based general traffic signal controller. The TSP agent assumes control when transit buses enter the dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) zone of the intersection. This agent is shown to reduce the bus travel time by about 21%, with marginal impacts to general traffic at a saturation rate of 0.95. The TSP agent also shows slightly better bus travel time compared to actuated signal control with TSP. The architecture of the agent and simulation is selected considering the need to improve simulation run time efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, most RL methods face difficulties when applied in the real world due to three factors: input, output, and the cycle-flow relation. The industry's observable input is much more limited than simulation-based RL methods. For real-world solutions, only flow can be reliably collected, whereas common RL methods need more. For the output action, most RL methods focus on acyclic control, which real-world signal controllers do not support. Most importantly, industry standards require a consistent cycle-flow relationship: non-decreasing and different response strategies for low, medium, and high-level flows, which is ignored by the RL methods. To narrow the gap between RL methods and industry standards, we innovatively propose to use industry solutions to guide the RL agent. Specifically, we design behavior cloning and curriculum learning to guide the agent to mimic and meet industry requirements and, at the same time, leverage the power of exploration and exploitation in RL for better performance. We theoretically prove that such guidance can largely decrease the sample complexity to polynomials in the horizon when searching for an optimal policy. Our rigid experiments show that our method has good cycle-flow relation and superior performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review of IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

Adaptive traffic signal control, which considers traffic conditions, has thus attracted attention. However, it is difficult to ensure optimal vehicle flow throughout a large city using existing control methods because of their heavy computational load. Here, we propose a control method called AMPIC (Adaptive Model Predictive Ising Controller) that guarantees both scalability and optimality. The proposed method employs model predictive control to solve an optimal control problem at each control interval with explicit consideration of a predictive model of vehicle flow. This optimal control problem is transformed into a combinatorial optimization problem with binary variables that is equivalent to the so-called Ising problem. This transformation allows us to use an Ising solver, which has been widely studied and is expected to have fast and efficient optimization performance. We performed numerical experiments using a microscopic traffic simulator for a realistic city road network. The results show that AMPIC enables faster vehicle cruising speed with less waiting time than that achieved by classical control methods, resulting in lower CO2 emissions. The model predictive approach with a long prediction horizon thus effectively improves control performance. Systematic parametric studies on model cities indicate that the proposed method realizes smoother traffic flows for large city road networks. Among Ising solvers, D-Wave's quantum annealing is shown to find near-optimal solutions at a reasonable computational cost.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

TSC is often modeled as a Markov Decision Process problem and then solved using reinforcement learning (RL), which has proven effective. However, the existing RL-based TSC system often overlooks imperfect observations caused by degraded communication, such as packet loss, delays, and noise, as well as rare real-life events not included in the reward function, such as unconsidered emergency vehicles. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel integration framework that combines a large language model (LLM) with RL. This framework is designed to manage overlooked elements in the reward function and gaps in state information, thereby enhancing the policies of RL agents. In our approach, RL initially makes decisions based on observed data. Subsequently, LLMs evaluate these decisions to verify their reasonableness. If a decision is found to be unreasonable, it is adjusted accordingly. Additionally, this integration approach can be seamlessly integrated with existing RL-based TSC systems without necessitating modifications. Extensive testing confirms that our approach reduces the average waiting time by $17.5\%$ in degraded communication conditions as compared to traditional RL methods, underscoring its potential to advance practical RL applications in intelligent transportation systems.

Adaptive traffic signals dynamically change signal timings based on observed traffic conditions in a way that might disrupt coordinated movements, particularly when these decisions are made independently at each intersection. To alleviate this issue, this paper introduces a novel Max Pressure-based traffic signal framework that can provide coordination even under decentralized decision-making. The proposed Coordinated Max Pressure (C-MP) algorithm uses the space mean speeds of vehicles to explicitly detect freely flowing platoons of vehicles and prioritizes their movement along a corridor. Specifically, upstream platoons are detected and their weight in the MP framework increased to provide priority, while downstream platoons are detected and their weight reduced to ensure smooth traffic flow across corridors. The study analytically proves that C-MP maintains the desirable maximum stability property, while micro-simulation analyses conducted on an arterial network demonstrate its ability to achieve a larger stable region compared to benchmark MP control policies. Simulation results also reveal that the proposed control algorithm can effectively coordinate traffic signals in both directions along an arterial without explicitly assigned offsets or constraints. The results also reveal C-MP's superiority to benchmark coordination strategies in reducing travel time, and fuel consumption both at the corridor level and the network level by balancing the negative impact imparted to vehicles in the minor direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies</p></details> |

Therefore, effective congestion management is imperative, with traffic signal control (TSC) systems being pivotal in this endeavor. Conventional TSC systems, designed upon rule-based algorithms or reinforcement learning (RL), frequently exhibit deficiencies in managing the complexities and variabilities of urban traffic flows, constrained by their limited capacity for adaptation to unfamiliar scenarios. In response to these limitations, this work introduces an innovative approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into TSC, harnessing their advanced reasoning and decision-making faculties. Specifically, a hybrid framework that augments LLMs with a suite of perception and decision-making tools is proposed, facilitating the interrogation of both the static and dynamic traffic information. This design places the LLM at the center of the decision-making process, combining external traffic data with established TSC methods. Moreover, a simulation platform is developed to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed framework. The findings from our simulations attest to the system's adeptness in adjusting to a multiplicity of traffic environments without the need for additional training. Notably, in cases of Sensor Outage (SO), our approach surpasses conventional RL-based systems by reducing the average waiting time by $20.4\%$. This research signifies a notable advance in TSC strategies and paves the way for the integration of LLMs into real-world, dynamic scenarios, highlighting their potential to revolutionize traffic management.

| **[Traffic Signal Cycle Control with Centralized Critic and Decentralized Actors under Varying Intervention Frequencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08248v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion in urban areas is a significant problem, leading to prolonged travel times, reduced efficiency, and increased environmental concerns. Effective traffic signal control (TSC) is a key strategy for reducing congestion. Unlike most TSC systems that rely on high-frequency control, this study introduces an innovative joint phase traffic signal cycle control method that operates effectively with varying control intervals. Our method features an adjust all phases action design, enabling simultaneous phase changes within the signal cycle, which fosters both immediate stability and sustained TSC effectiveness, especially at lower frequencies. The approach also integrates decentralized actors to handle the complexity of the action space, with a centralized critic to ensure coordinated phase adjusting. Extensive testing on both synthetic and real-world data across different intersection types and signal setups shows that our method significantly outperforms other popular techniques, particularly at high control intervals. Case studies of policies derived from traffic data further illustrate the robustness and reliability of our proposed method.</p></details> | 26 pages, 17 figures |

The uniform metering rate for cordon signals in most existing studies overlooks the variance of local traffic states at the intersection level, which may cause severe local traffic congestion and degradation of the network stability. PC strategies with heterogeneous metering rates for cordon signals allow precise control for the perimeter but the complexity of the problem increases exponentially with the scale of the PN. This paper leverages a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based traffic signal control framework to decompose this PC problem, which considers heterogeneous metering rates for cordon signals, into multi-agent cooperation tasks. Each agent controls an individual signal located in the cordon, decreasing the dimension of action space for the controller compared to centralized methods. A physics regularization approach for the MARL framework is proposed to ensure the distributed cordon signal controllers are aware of the global network state by encoding MFD-based knowledge into the action-value functions of the local agents. The proposed PC strategy is operated as a two-stage system, with a feedback PC strategy detecting the overall traffic state within the PN and then distributing local instructions to cordon signals controllers in the MARL framework via the physics regularization. Through numerical tests with different demand patterns in a microscopic traffic environment, the proposed PC strategy shows promising robustness and transferability. It outperforms state-of-the-art feedback PC strategies in increasing network throughput, decreasing distributed delay for gate links, and reducing carbon emissions.</p></details> | 21 pages, 24 figures |

To address this issue, various tools can exert influence on traffic safety both directly and indirectly. This study focuses on investigating the impact of adaptive signal control and connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) on intersection safety using a deep reinforcement learning approach. The objective is to assess the individual and combined effects of CAVs and adaptive traffic signal control on traffic safety, considering rear-end and crossing conflicts. The study employs a Deep Q Network (DQN) to regulate traffic signals and driving behaviors of both CAVs and Human Drive Vehicles (HDVs), and uses Time To Collision (TTC) metric to evaluate safety. The findings demonstrate a significant reduction in rear-end and crossing conflicts through the combined implementation of CAVs and DQNs-based traffic signal control. Additionally, the long-term positive effects of CAVs on safety are similar to the short-term effects of combined CAVs and DQNs-based traffic signal control. Overall, the study emphasizes the potential benefits of integrating CAVs and adaptive traffic signal control approaches in order to enhance traffic safety. The findings of this study could provide valuable insights for city officials and transportation authorities in developing effective strategies to improve safety at signalized intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>TRB 1...</summary><p>TRB 103nd Annual Meeting</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Stabilize Online Reinforcement Learning in Unbounded State Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01896v3)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, we want policies that reach desired states and then keep the controlled system within an acceptable region around the desired states over an indefinite period of time. This latter objective is called stability and is especially important when the state space is unbounded, such that the states can be arbitrarily far from each other and the agent can drift far away from the desired states. For example, in stochastic queuing networks, where queues of waiting jobs can grow without bound, the desired state is all-zero queue lengths. Here, a stable policy ensures queue lengths are finite while an optimal policy minimizes queue lengths. Since an optimal policy is also stable, one would expect that RL algorithms would implicitly give us stable policies. However, in this work, we find that deep RL algorithms that directly minimize the distance to the desired state during online training often result in unstable policies, i.e., policies that drift far away from the desired state. We attribute this instability to poor credit-assignment for destabilizing actions. We then introduce an approach based on two ideas: 1) a Lyapunov-based cost-shaping technique and 2) state transformations to the unbounded state space. We conduct an empirical study on various queueing networks and traffic signal control problems and find that our approach performs competitively against strong baselines with knowledge of the transition dynamics.

A pipeline for intersection data imputation from OpenStreetMap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13480v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signalized intersections, arguably the most complicated type of traffic scenario, are essential to urban mobility systems. With recent advancements in intelligent transportation technologies, signalized intersections have great prospects for making transportation greener, safer, and faster. Several studies have been conducted focusing on intersection-level control and optimization. However, arbitrarily structured signalized intersections that are often used do not represent the ground-truth distribution, and there is no standardized way that exists to extract information about real-world signalized intersections. As the largest open-source map in the world, OpenStreetMap (OSM) has been used by many transportation researchers for a variety of studies, including intersection-level research such as adaptive traffic signal control and eco-driving. However, the quality of OSM data has been a serious concern. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for effectively extracting information about signalized intersections from OSM and constructing a comprehensive dataset. We thoroughly discuss challenges related to this task and we propose our solution for each challenge. We also use Salt Lake City as an example to demonstrate the performance of our methods. The pipeline has been published as an open-source Python library so everyone can freely download and use it to facilitate their research. Hopefully, this paper can serve as a starting point that inspires more efforts to build a standardized and systematic data pipeline for various types of transportation problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DataLight: Offline Data-Driven Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10828v2)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising solution for addressing traffic signal control (TSC) challenges. While most RL-based TSC systems typically employ an online approach, facilitating frequent active interaction with the environment, learning such strategies in the real world is impractical due to safety and risk concerns. To tackle these challenges, this study introduces an innovative offline data-driven approach, called DataLight. DataLight employs effective state representations and reward function by capturing vehicular speed information within the environment. It then segments roads to capture spatial information and further enhances the spatially segmented state representations with sequential modeling. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DataLight, showcasing superior performance compared to both state-of-the-art online and offline TSC methods. Additionally, DataLight exhibits robust learning capabilities concerning real-world deployment issues.

| **[DynamicLight: Two-Stage Dynamic Traffic Signal Timing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01025v2)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is gaining popularity as an effective approach for traffic signal control (TSC) and is increasingly applied in this domain. However, most existing RL methodologies are confined to a single-stage TSC framework, primarily focusing on selecting an appropriate traffic signal phase at fixed action intervals, leading to inflexible and less adaptable phase durations. To address such limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage TSC framework named DynamicLight. This framework initiates with a phase control strategy responsible for determining the optimal traffic phase, followed by a duration control strategy tasked with determining the corresponding phase duration. Experimental results show that DynamicLight outperforms state-of-the-art TSC models and exhibits exceptional model generalization capabilities. Additionally, the robustness and potential for real-world implementation of DynamicLight are further demonstrated and validated through various DynamicLight variants. The code is released at https://github.com/LiangZhang1996/DynamicLight.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

The proposed Coordinated Maximum Pressure-plus-Penalty (CMPP) control policy features a local objective for each intersection that consists of the total pressure within the neighborhood and a penalty accounting for the queue capacities and continuous green time for certain movements. The corresponding control task is reformulated as a distributed optimization problem and solved via two customized algorithms: one based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the other follows a greedy heuristic augmented with a majority vote. CMPP not only provides a theoretical guarantee of queuing network stability but also outperforms several benchmark controllers in simulations on a large-scale real traffic network with lower average travel and waiting time per vehicle, as well as less network congestion. Furthermore, CPMM with the greedy algorithm enjoys comparable computational efficiency as fully decentralized controllers without significantly compromising the control performance, which highlights its great potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uninterrupted Maximum Flow on Signalized Traffic Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16592v2)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes a traffic signal control strategy that allows motorists who travel at a recommended speed on suburban arterial two-way roads with a common cycle time to make every traffic signal. A road-to-traveler-feedback-device (RTFD) advises motorists how fast they should travel to do this. Signalized arterial roads where vehicles that travel at the recommended speed make every traffic signal are termed Ride-the-Green-Wave (RGW) roads. Left-turn-arounds enable vehicles to turn left from two-way RGW-roads to intersecting/orthogonal two-way RGW-road while allowing maximum flow at the intersection. The traffic signal control technique that enables vehicles that travel at the recommended speed to make every traffic signal has been verified using a simulation program (RGW-SIM). In addition to introducing novel traffic signal control strategies, the methods presented in this paper have implications for road network design, public transport control, connected and automated vehicles and environmental impacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 30 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, it presents unique challenges, due to the complex roadway layout at intersections, involvement of traffic signal controls, and interactions among different types of road users. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel model called Knowledge-Informed Generative Adversarial Network (KI-GAN), which integrates both traffic signal information and multi-vehicle interactions to predict vehicle trajectories accurately. Additionally, we propose a specialized attention pooling method that accounts for vehicle orientation and proximity at intersections. Based on the SinD dataset, our KI-GAN model is able to achieve an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 0.05 and a Final Displacement Error (FDE) of 0.12 for a 6-second observation and 6-second prediction cycle. When the prediction window is extended to 9 seconds, the ADE and FDE values are further reduced to 0.11 and 0.26, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed KI-GAN model in vehicle trajectory prediction under complex scenarios at signalized intersections, which represents a significant advancement in the target field.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 CVPR AICity Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Traffic Signal Control and Speed Offset Coordination Using Q-Learning for Arterial Road Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06382v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arterial traffic interacts with freeway traffic, yet the two are controlled independently. Arterial traffic signals do not take into account freeway traffic and how ramps control ingress traffic and have no control over egress traffic from the freeway. This often results in long queues in either direction that block ramps and spill over to arterial streets or freeway lanes. In this paper, we propose an adaptive arterial traffic control strategy that combines traffic signal control (TSC) and dynamic speed offset (DSO) coordination using a Q-learning algorithm for a traffic network that involves a freeway segment and adjacent arterial streets. The TSC agent computes the signal cycle length and split based on observed intersection demands and adjacent freeway off-ramp queues. The DSO agent computes the relative offset and the recommended speeds of both ways between consecutive intersections based on their physical distance, intersection queues, and signal cycles. We evaluate the performance of the proposed arterial traffic control strategy using microscopic traffic simulations of an arterial corridor with seven intersections near the I-710 freeway. The proposed QL-based control significantly outperforms a fixed-time control and MAXBAND in terms of the travel time and the number of stops under low or moderate demands. In high-demand scenarios, the travel-time benefit provided by the QL-based control is reduced as it mitigates off-ramp and intersection queues, which is a necessary trade-off in our perspective. In addition, mutual benefit is obtained by implementing freeway and arterial traffic control simultaneously.</p></details> | submitted to TR-C |

While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical sophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and heterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy aging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age gap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain age gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's predicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The resulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with recent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and severity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their methodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical populations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces a principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in graph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks (GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the anatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong theoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust estimation of brain age gap predictions. By integrating perspectives from GSP, machine learning, and network neuroscience, this work clarifies the path forward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research directions in personalized medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Signal Processing Magazine</p></details> |

A common remedy is to sparsify the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and versatility of our multi-view approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to TAG workshop</p></details> |

The general chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT) significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes. Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference in industrial drug discovery workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Exact Subgraph Matching via GNN-based Path Dominance Embedding (Technical Report)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15641v5)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classic problem of exact subgraph matching returns those subgraphs in a large-scale data graph that are isomorphic to a given query graph, which has gained increasing importance in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective graph neural network (GNN)-based path embedding framework (GNN-PE), which allows efficient exact subgraph matching without introducing false dismissals. Unlike traditional GNN-based graph embeddings that only produce approximate subgraph matching results, in this paper, we carefully devise GNN-based embeddings for paths, such that: if two paths (and 1-hop neighbors of vertices on them) have the subgraph relationship, their corresponding GNN-based embedding vectors will strictly follow the dominance relationship. With such a newly designed property of path dominance embeddings, we are able to propose effective pruning strategies based on path label/dominance embeddings and guarantee no false dismissals for subgraph matching. We build multidimensional indexes over path embedding vectors, and develop an efficient subgraph matching algorithm by traversing indexes over graph partitions in parallel and applying our pruning methods. We also propose a cost-model-based query plan that obtains query paths from the query graph with low query cost. To further optimize our GNN-PE approach, we also propose a more efficient GNN-based path group embedding (GNN-PGE) technique, which performs subgraph matching over grouped path embedding vectors. We design effective pruning strategies (w.r.t. grouped path embeddings) that can significantly reduce the search space during the index traversal. Through extensive experiments, we confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed GNN-PE and GNN-PGE approaches for exact subgraph matching on both real and synthetic graph data.</p></details> |  |

Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network, Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC) 2026 - Las Vegas, NV, USA 9 - 12 January 2026</p></details> |

Promotion abuse is one of the fastest-growing types of fraud in recent years and is characterized by users exploiting promotional activities to gain financial benefits from the platform. To investigate this issue, we conduct the first study on promotion abuse fraud in e-commerce platforms MEITUAN. We find that promotion abuse fraud is a group-based fraudulent activity with two types of fraudulent activities: Stocking Up and Cashback Abuse. Unlike traditional fraudulent activities such as fake reviews, promotion abuse fraud typically involves ordinary customers conducting legitimate transactions and these two types of fraudulent activities are often intertwined. To address this issue, we propose leveraging additional information from the spatial and temporal perspectives to detect promotion abuse fraud. In this paper, we introduce PROMOGUARDIAN, a novel multi-relation fused graph neural network that integrates the spatial and temporal information of transaction data into a homogeneous graph to detect promotion abuse fraud. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world data from MEITUAN, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in promotion abuse fraud detection, achieving 93.15% precision, detecting 2.1 to 5.0 times more fraudsters, and preventing 1.5 to 8.8 times more financial losses in production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The final version of this paper is going to appear in IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2026</p></details> |
| **[Computing Systemic Risk Measures with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07222v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates systemic risk measures for stochastic financial networks of explicitly modelled bilateral liabilities. We extend the notion of systemic risk measures from Biagini, Fouque, Fritelli and Meyer-Brandis (2019) to graph structured data. In particular, we focus on an aggregation function that is derived from a market clearing algorithm proposed by Eisenberg and Noe (2001). In this setting, we show the existence of an optimal random allocation that distributes the overall minimal bailout capital and secures the network. We study numerical methods for the approximation of systemic risk and optimal random allocations. We propose to use permutation equivariant architectures of neural networks like graph neural networks (GNNs) and a class that we name (extended) permutation equivariant neural networks ((X)PENNs). We compare their performance to several benchmark allocations. The main feature of GNNs and (X)PENNs is that they are permutation equivariant with respect to the underlying graph data. In numerical experiments we find evidence that these permutation equivariant methods are superior to other approaches.</p></details> | 50 pages |
| **[Maximum entropy temporal networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02098v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal networks consist of timestamped directed interactions that may appear continuously in time, yet few studies have directly tackled the continuous-time modeling of networks. Here, we introduce a maximum-entropy approach to temporal networks and with basic assumptions on constraints, the corresponding network ensembles admit a modular and interpretable representation: a set of global time processes and a static maximum-entropy edge, e.g. node pair, probability. This time-edge labels factorization yields closed-form log-likelihoods, degree, clustering and motif expectations, and yields a whole class of effective generative models. We provide maximum-entropy derivation of an inhomogeneous Poisson edge intensity for temporal networks via functional optimization over path entropy, connecting NHPP modeling to maximum-entropy network ensembles. NHPP consistently improve log-likelihood over generic Poisson processes, while the maximum-entropy edge labels recover strength constraints and reproduce expected unique-degree curves. We discuss the limitations of this framework and how it can be integrated with multivariate Hawkes calibration procedures, renewal theory, and neural kernel estimation in graph neural networks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Enhanced Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks for Million-Scale Heterogeneous Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12401v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Scaling Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning through GNN-Derived Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12840v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance, resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate them against standard baselines, showing improvements in the scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Teleconnections with Physics-Informed Graph Attention Networks for Long-Range Extreme Rainfall Forecasting in Thailand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12328v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water management.</p></details> |  |

Our multi-scale model maps data between input/output point clouds by passing it through a downsampled regional mesh. The approach includes novel elements aimed at ensuring spatio-temporal resolution invariance. Our model, termed RIGNO, is tested on a challenging suite of benchmarks composed of various time-dependent and steady PDEs defined on a diverse set of domains. We demonstrate that RIGNO is significantly more accurate than neural operator baselines and robustly generalizes to unseen resolutions both in space and in time. Our code is publicly available at github.com/camlab-ethz/rigno.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism, implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves original feature information through residual connections, which is critical for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint was submitted to IEEE TrustCom 2025.

| **[Unveiling the Vulnerability of Graph-LLMs: An Interpretable Multi-Dimensional Adversarial Attack on TAGs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12233v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models (LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs, offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and resources are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IMDGA-7289.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Attention-Aware GNN-based Input Defense against Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreak](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07146v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in various applications, yet their capabilities present risks for both constructive and malicious exploitation. Despite extensive training and fine-tuning efforts aimed at enhancing safety, LLMs remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Recently, the emergence of multi-turn attacks has intensified this vulnerability. Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks incrementally escalate dialogue complexity, rendering them more challenging to detect and mitigate. In this study, we introduce G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based input classifier specifically designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks targeting LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, which captures the interrelationships between queries and harmful keywords that present in multi-turn queries. Furthermore, we propose an attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most relevant single-turn query based on the ongoing multi-turn conversation. The retrieved query is incorporated as a labeled node within the graph, thereby enhancing the GNN's capacity to classify the current query as harmful or benign. Evaluation results show that G-Guard consistently outperforms all baselines across diverse datasets and evaluation metrics, demonstrating its efficacy as a robust defense mechanism against multi-turn jailbreak attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Fair Graph Neural Networks Via Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00382v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in graph representation learning across various real-world applications. However, they often produce biased predictions caused by sensitive attributes, such as religion or gender, an issue that has been largely overlooked in existing methods. Recently, numerous studies have focused on reducing biases in GNNs. However, these approaches often rely on training with partial data (e.g., using either node features or graph structure alone), which can enhance fairness but frequently compromises model utility due to the limited utilization of available graph information. To address this tradeoff, we propose an effective strategy to balance fairness and utility in knowledge distillation. Specifically, we introduce FairDTD, a novel Fair representation learning framework built on Dual-Teacher Distillation, leveraging a causal graph model to guide and optimize the design of the distillation process. Specifically, FairDTD employs two fairness-oriented teacher models: a feature teacher and a structure teacher, to facilitate dual distillation, with the student model learning fairness knowledge from the teachers while also leveraging full data to mitigate utility loss. To enhance information transfer, we incorporate graph-level distillation to provide an indirect supplement of graph information during training, as well as a node-specific temperature module to improve the comprehensive transfer of fair knowledge. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairDTD achieves optimal fairness while preserving high model utility, showcasing its effectiveness in fair representation learning for GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Estimation on Graphs with Structure Informed Stochastic Partial Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06907v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks have achieved impressive results across diverse network modeling tasks, but accurately estimating uncertainty on graphs remains difficult, especially under distributional shifts. Unlike traditional uncertainty estimation, graph-based uncertainty must account for randomness arising from both the graph's structure and its label distribution, which adds complexity. In this paper, making an analogy between the evolution of a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by Matern Gaussian Process and message passing using GNN layers, we present a principled way to design a novel message passing scheme that incorporates spatial-temporal noises motivated by the Gaussian Process approach to SPDE. Our method simultaneously captures uncertainty across space and time and allows explicit control over the covariance kernel smoothness, thereby enhancing uncertainty estimates on graphs with both low and high label informativeness. Our extensive experiments on Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection on graph datasets with varying label informativeness demonstrate the soundness and superiority of our model to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Euclidean and Hyperbolic Representations for Node-level Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11827v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the original features and structural features derived from random walks and degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.</p></details> |  |

We describe an algorithm for the satisfiability problem of that logic. It is inspired from the tableau method of vanilla modal logic, extended with reasoning in quantifier-free fragment Boolean algebra with Presburger arithmetic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query-Specific GNN: A Comprehensive Graph Representation Learning Method for Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11541v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources. However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network (QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at: https://github.com/Jerry2398/QSGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Interpretable and Effective Graph Neural Additive Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01317v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant approach for learning over graph-structured data. However, most GNNs operate as black-box models and require post-hoc explanations, which may not suffice in high-stakes scenarios where transparency is crucial. In this paper, we present a GNN that is interpretable by design. Our model, Graph Neural Additive Network (GNAN), is a novel extension of the interpretable class of Generalized Additive Models, and can be visualized and fully understood by humans. GNAN is designed to be fully interpretable, offering both global and local explanations at the feature and graph levels through direct visualization of the model. These visualizations describe exactly how the model uses the relationships between the target variable, the features, and the graph. We demonstrate the intelligibility of GNANs in a series of examples on different tasks and datasets. In addition, we show that the accuracy of GNAN is on par with black-box GNNs, making it suitable for critical applications where transparency is essential, alongside high accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-View Graph Feature Propagation for Privacy Preservation and Feature Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11347v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks. Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each propagating information independently through the graph topology. The aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Event-Aware Prompt Learning for Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11339v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks. Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.</p></details> | Under review |

We address this by proposing, to our knowledge, the first-ever SDEN (Software Defined Energy Network) for CaaS (Computations-as-a-Service) that unifies edge, fog, and cloud compute with 5G URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications), SDN (Software Defined Networking), and NFV (Network Functions Virtualization) to co-optimize energy, latency, and reliability end-to-end. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a joint task offloading formulation that couples computation placement with network capacity under explicit URLLC constraints; (ii) a feasibility preserving, lightweight greedy heuristic that scales while closely tracking optimal energy and latency trade-offs; and (iii) a tiered AI (Artificial Intelligence) pipeline-reactive at the edge, predictive in the fog, strategic in the cloud-featuring privacy-preserving, federated GNNs (Graph Neural Networks) for fault detection and microgrid coordination. Unlike prior edge-only or cloud-only schemes, SDEN turns fragmented grid compute into a single, programmable substrate that delivers dependable, energy-aware, real time analytics establishing a first-ever, software defined path to practical, grid-scale CaaS.</p></details> |  |

This task is particularly challenging in Graph Neural Network models due to the variable output sizes of graph-structured data. In this paper, we introduce ProjNet, a Graph Neural Network framework which satisfies input-dependant constraints. ProjNet combines a sparse vector clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, an iterative scheme for solving the best-approximation problem. We establish a convergence result for CAD and develop a GPU-accelerated implementation capable of handling large-scale inputs efficiently. To enable end-to-end training, we introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD that is both computationally efficient and better suited for optimization than the exact gradient. We validate ProjNet on four classes of constrained optimisation problems: linear programming, two classes of non-convex quadratic programs, and radio transmit power optimization, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse problem settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06743v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning. Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range interactions are captured through a flexible spectral-domain parameterization. This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: New Perspectives in Advancing Graph Machine Learning</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Network-Based Multicast Routing for On-Demand Streaming Services in 6G Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11109v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increase of bandwidth-intensive applications in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, such as real-time volumetric streaming and multi-sensory extended reality, demands intelligent multicast routing solutions capable of delivering differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) at scale. Traditional shortest-path and multicast routing algorithms are either computationally prohibitive or structurally rigid, and they often fail to support heterogeneous user demands, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. Neural network-based approaches, while offering improved inference speed, typically lack topological generalization and scalability. To address these limitations, this paper presents a graph neural network (GNN)-based multicast routing framework that jointly minimizes total transmission cost and supports user-specific video quality requirements. The routing problem is formulated as a constrained minimum-flow optimization task, and a reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to sequentially construct efficient multicast trees by reusing paths and adapting to network dynamics. A graph attention network (GAT) is employed as the encoder to extract context-aware node embeddings, while a long short-term memory (LSTM) module models the sequential dependencies in routing decisions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method closely approximates optimal dynamic programming-based solutions while significantly reducing computational complexity. The results also confirm strong generalization to large-scale and dynamic network topologies, highlighting the method's potential for real-time deployment in 6G multimedia delivery scenarios.

| **[Revisiting Node Affinity Prediction in Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06940v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS - Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising, training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics. Our source code is available at https://github.com/orfeld415/NAVIS</p></details> | preprint |

A significant challenge in this domain is the generalizability of preference models, particularly their efficacy in predicting preferences within environmental configurations not encountered during training. While deep learning models have shown promise in learning complex spatial and contextual dependencies, it remains unclear which neural network architectures are most effective at generalizing to unseen layouts. To address this, we conduct a comparative study of Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and standard feedforward Neural Networks using synthetic data generated from a simplified and synthetic pocket park environment. Beginning with this illustrative case study, allows for controlled analysis of each model's ability to transfer learned preference patterns to unseen spatial scenarios. The models are evaluated based on their capacity to predict preferences influenced by heterogeneous physical, environmental, and social features. Generalizability score is calculated using the area under the precision-recall curve for the seen and unseen layouts. This generalizability score is appropriate for imbalanced data, providing insights into the suitability of each neural network architecture for preference-aware human behavior modeling in unseen built environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 15th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (IWSHM)</p></details> |

Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.</p></details> |  |

A novel approach that combines game-theoretic control theory with Graph Neural Networks is introduced in this work. By conceptualizing pursuer configurations as strategic arrangements and representing them as graphs, a Graph Characteristic Space is constructed via multi-objective optimization to identify Pareto-optimal configurations. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained on these Pareto-optimal graphs to generate strategically effective initial configurations, termed "hot starts". Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the GCN-generated hot starts provide a significant advantage over random configurations. In scenarios considering multiple pursuers and evaders, this method hastens the decline in evader survival rates, reduces pursuer travel distances, and enhances containment, showcasing clear strategic benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at AAMAS Workshop on Autonomous Robots and Multirobot Systems (ARMS)</p></details> |

Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing. Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.</p></details> |  |

With their growing adoption in engineering design evaluation, a wide range of neural operator architectures have been proposed for various problem settings. However, model selection remains challenging due to the absence of fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address this, we propose and standardize six representative 3D industry-scale engineering design datasets spanning thermal analysis, linear elasticity, elasto-plasticity, time-dependent plastic problems, and computational fluid dynamics. All datasets include fully preprocessed inputs and outputs for model training, making them directly usable across diverse neural operator architectures. Using these datasets, we conduct a systematic comparison of four types of neural operator variants, including Branch-Trunk-based Neural Operators inspired by DeepONet, Graph-based Neural Operators inspired by Graph Neural Networks, Grid-based Neural Operators inspired by Fourier Neural Operators, and Point-based Neural Operators inspired by PointNet. We further introduce practical enhancements to adapt these models to different engineering settings, improving the fairness of the comparison. Our benchmarking study evaluates each model strengths and limitations in terms of predictive performance, computational efficiency, memory usage, and deployment complexity. The findings provide actionable insights to guide future neural operator development.</p></details> |  |

Structure-based pre-training methods are under-explored yet crucial for downstream applications which rely on underlying graph structure. In addition, pre-training traditional message passing GNNs to capture global and regional structure is often challenging due to the risk of oversmoothing as network depth increases. We address these gaps by proposing the Laplacian Eigenvector Learning Module (LELM), a novel pre-training module for graph neural networks (GNNs) based on predicting the low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Moreover, LELM introduces a novel architecture that overcomes oversmoothing, allowing the GNN model to learn long-range interdependencies. Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform baseline models on downstream molecular property prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose S$^2$G-Net, a novel neural architecture that unifies state-space sequence modeling with multi-view Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for ICU LOS prediction. The temporal path employs Mamba state-space models (SSMs) to capture patient trajectories, while the graph path leverages an optimized GraphGPS backbone, designed to integrate heterogeneous patient similarity graphs derived from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic features. Experiments on the large-scale MIMIC-IV cohort dataset show that S$^2$G-Net consistently outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba, Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches across all primary metrics. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability analyses highlight the complementary contributions of each component of our architecture and underscore the importance of principled graph construction. These results demonstrate that S$^2$G-Net provides an effective and scalable solution for ICU LOS prediction with multi-modal clinical data.

| **[Preference-driven Knowledge Distillation for Few-shot Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10116v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs (TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge. Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD) framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Integrating Structure-Aware Attention and Knowledge Graphs in Explainable Recommendation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10109v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper designs and implements an explainable recommendation model that integrates knowledge graphs with structure-aware attention mechanisms. The model is built on graph neural networks and incorporates a multi-hop neighbor aggregation strategy. By integrating the structural information of knowledge graphs and dynamically assigning importance to different neighbors through an attention mechanism, the model enhances its ability to capture implicit preference relationships. In the proposed method, users and items are embedded into a unified graph structure. Multi-level semantic paths are constructed based on entities and relations in the knowledge graph to extract richer contextual information. During the rating prediction phase, recommendations are generated through the interaction between user and target item representations. The model is optimized using a binary cross-entropy loss function. Experiments conducted on the Amazon Books dataset validate the superior performance of the proposed model across various evaluation metrics. The model also shows good convergence and stability. These results further demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of structure-aware attention mechanisms in knowledge graph-enhanced recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lighter-X: An Efficient and Plug-and-play Strategy for Graph-based Recommendation through Decoupled Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10105v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose \textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters, identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rademacher Meets Colors: More Expressivity, but at What Cost ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10101v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity -- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power often comes at the cost of generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRAP: Spatio-Temporal Pattern Retrieval for Out-of-Distribution Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19547v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling dynamic graph-structured data across diverse domains. However, they often fail to generalize in Spatio-Temporal Out-of-Distribution (STOOD) scenarios, where both temporal dynamics and spatial structures evolve beyond the training distribution. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Spatio-Temporal Retrieval-Augmented Pattern Learning framework,STRAP, which enhances model generalization by integrating retrieval-augmented learning into the STGNN continue learning pipeline. The core of STRAP is a compact and expressive pattern library that stores representative spatio-temporal patterns enriched with historical, structural, and semantic information, which is obtained and optimized during the training phase. During inference, STRAP retrieves relevant patterns from this library based on similarity to the current input and injects them into the model via a plug-and-play prompting mechanism. This not only strengthens spatio-temporal representations but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, STRAP introduces a knowledge-balancing objective to harmonize new information with retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world streaming graph datasets show that STRAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art STGNN baselines on STOOD tasks, demonstrating its robustness, adaptability, and strong generalization capability without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Joint Embeddings of Function and Process Call Graphs for Malware Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09984v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation. While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318 malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods face two fundamental challenges: the limited reasoning capacity of single-agent systems and the complexity of designing effective multi-agent architectures, as well as contextual overload that hinders accurate decision-making. We introduce Nutritional-Graph Router (NG-Router), a novel framework that formulates nutritional QA as a supervised, knowledge-graph-guided multi-agent collaboration problem. NG-Router integrates agent nodes into heterogeneous knowledge graphs and employs a graph neural network to learn task-aware routing distributions over agents, leveraging soft supervision derived from empirical agent performance. To further address contextual overload, we propose a gradient-based subgraph retrieval mechanism that identifies salient evidence during training, thereby enhancing multi-hop and relational reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbone models demonstrate that NG-Router consistently outperforms both single-agent and ensemble baselines, offering a principled approach to domain-aware multi-agent reasoning for complex nutritional health tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HeSRN: Representation Learning On Heterogeneous Graphs via Slot-Aware Retentive Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09767v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network Surrogates to leverage Mechanistic Expert Knowledge towards Reliable and Immediate Pandemic Response](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06500v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During the COVID-19 crisis, mechanistic models have guided evidence-based decision making. However, time-critical decisions in a dynamical environment limit the time available to gather supporting evidence. We address this bottleneck by developing a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate of a spatially and demographically resolved mechanistic metapopulation simulator. This combined approach advances classical machine learning approaches which are often black box. Our design of experiments spans outbreak and persistent-threat regimes, up to three contact change points, and age-structured contact matrices on a 400-node spatial graph. We benchmark multiple GNN layers and identify an ARMAConv-based architecture that offers a strong accuracy-runtime trade-off. Across 30-90 day horizons and up to three contact change points, the surrogate attains 10-27 % mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) while delivering (near) constant runtime with respect to the forecast horizon. Our approach accelerates evaluation by up to 28,670 times compared with the mechanistic model, allowing responsive decision support in time-critical scenarios and straightforward web integration. These results show how GNN surrogates can translate complex metapopulation models into immediate, reliable tools for pandemic response.</p></details> | 29 pages, 7 figures |

However,existing physics-based and data-driven models often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data. We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37 years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States, Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental monitoring and decision-making.</p></details> |  |

We build on previous work that successfully designed site-specific precoders based on a combination of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). In this paper, by utilizing a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we circumvent one of the key drawbacks of GMMs, i.e., the number of GMM components scales exponentially to the feedback bits. In addition, the deep learning architecture of the VQ-VAE allows us to jointly train the GNN together with VQ-VAE along with pilot optimization forming an end-to-end (E2E) model, resulting in considerable performance gains in sum rate for multi-user wireless systems. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed frameworks over the conventional methods involving the sub-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) pilot matrix and iterative precoder algorithms enabling the deployment of systems characterized by fewer pilots or feedback bits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[A Multimodal Approach to SME Credit Scoring Integrating Transaction and Ownership Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09407v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are known to play a vital role in economic growth, employment, and innovation. However, they tend to face significant challenges in accessing credit due to limited financial histories, collateral constraints, and exposure to macroeconomic shocks. These challenges make an accurate credit risk assessment by lenders crucial, particularly since SMEs frequently operate within interconnected firm networks through which default risk can propagate. This paper presents and tests a novel approach for modelling the risk of SME credit, using a unique large data set of SME loans provided by a prominent financial institution. Specifically, our approach employs Graph Neural Networks to predict SME default using multilayer network data derived from common ownership and financial transactions between firms. We show that combining this information with traditional structured data not only improves application scoring performance, but also explicitly models contagion risk between companies. Further analysis shows how the directionality and intensity of these connections influence financial risk contagion, offering a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. Our findings highlight the predictive power of network data, as well as the role of supply chain networks in exposing SMEs to correlated default risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey of Mamba Architectures for Medical Image Analysis: Classification, Segmentation, Restoration and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02362v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a special case of the State Space Model, is gaining popularity as an alternative to template-based deep learning approaches in medical image analysis. While transformers are powerful architectures, they have drawbacks, including quadratic computational complexity and an inability to address long-range dependencies efficiently. This limitation affects the analysis of large and complex datasets in medical imaging, where there are many spatial and temporal relationships. In contrast, Mamba offers benefits that make it well-suited for medical image analysis. It has linear time complexity, which is a significant improvement over transformers. Mamba processes longer sequences without attention mechanisms, enabling faster inference and requiring less memory. Mamba also demonstrates strong performance in merging multimodal data, improving diagnosis accuracy and patient outcomes. The organization of this paper allows readers to appreciate the capabilities of Mamba in medical imaging step by step. We begin by defining core concepts of SSMs and models, including S4, S5, and S6, followed by an exploration of Mamba architectures such as pure Mamba, U-Net variants, and hybrid models with convolutional neural networks, transformers, and Graph Neural Networks. We also cover Mamba optimizations, techniques and adaptations, scanning, datasets, applications, experimental results, and conclude with its challenges and future directions in medical imaging. This review aims to demonstrate the transformative potential of Mamba in overcoming existing barriers within medical imaging while paving the way for innovative advancements in the field. A comprehensive list of Mamba architectures applied in the medical field, reviewed in this work, is available at Github.</p></details> |  |

Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live, interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live, explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events (arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial advantage for a reliable decision support tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGSPATIAL 2025 - GeoAI Workshop</p></details> |

The prevailing paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn, adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors, enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[When LLM Agents Meet Graph Optimization: An Automated Data Quality Improvement Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08952v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7figures |

We investigate the Set Cover Problem (SCP) and propose Graph-SCP, a graph neural network method that augments existing optimization solvers by learning to identify a smaller sub-problem that contains the solution space. Graph-SCP uses both supervised learning from prior solved instances and unsupervised learning to minimize the SCP objective. We evaluate the performance of Graph-SCP on synthetically weighted and unweighted SCP instances with diverse problem characteristics and complexities, and on instances from the OR Library, a canonical benchmark for SCP. We show that Graph-SCP reduces the problem size by 60-80% and achieves runtime speedups of up to 10x on average when compared to Gurobi (a state-of-the-art commercial solver), while maintaining solution quality. This is in contrast to fast greedy solutions that significantly compromise solution quality to achieve guaranteed polynomial runtime. We showcase Graph-SCP's ability to generalize to larger problem sizes, training on SCP instances with up to 3,000 subsets and testing on SCP instances with up to 10,000 subsets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Graph Condensation via Gaussian Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02565v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph condensation reduces the size of large graphs while preserving performance, addressing the scalability challenges of Graph Neural Networks caused by computational inefficiencies on large datasets. Existing methods often rely on bi-level optimization, requiring extensive GNN training and limiting their scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes Graph Condensation via Gaussian Process (GCGP), a novel and computationally efficient approach to graph condensation. GCGP utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP), with the condensed graph serving as observations, to estimate the posterior distribution of predictions. This approach eliminates the need for the iterative and resource-intensive training typically required by GNNs. To enhance the capability of the GCGP in capturing dependencies between function values, we derive a specialized covariance function that incorporates structural information. This covariance function broadens the receptive field of input nodes by local neighborhood aggregation, thereby facilitating the representation of intricate dependencies within the nodes. To address the challenge of optimizing binary structural information in condensed graphs, Concrete random variables are utilized to approximate the binary adjacency matrix in a continuous counterpart. This relaxation process allows the adjacency matrix to be represented in a differentiable form, enabling the application of gradient-based optimization techniques to discrete graph structures. Experimental results show that the proposed GCGP method efficiently condenses large-scale graph data while preserving predictive performance, addressing the scalability and efficiency challenges. The implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WANGLin0126/GCGP.</p></details> |  |

However, existing work on fair GNNs often assumes that either sensitive attributes are fully observed or they are missing completely at random. We show that an adversarial missingness process can inadvertently disguise a fair model through the imputation, leading the model to overestimate the fairness of its predictions. We address this challenge by proposing Better Fair than Sorry (BFtS), a fair missing data imputation model for sensitive attributes. The key principle behind BFtS is that imputations should approximate the worst-case scenario for fairness -- i.e. when optimizing fairness is the hardest. We implement this idea using a 3-player adversarial scheme where two adversaries collaborate against a GNN classifier, and the classifier minimizes the maximum bias. Experiments using synthetic and real datasets show that BFtS often achieves a better fairness x accuracy trade-off than existing alternatives under an adversarial missingness process.</p></details> |  |

While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity. Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 22 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

These solutions employ Machine Learning (ML) models for behavioral modeling and critical security tasks such as malware and anomaly detection. However, the opacity of ML-based security models limits their broader adoption, as the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes restricts explainability and verifiability. We tailored our solution towards Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based security solutions since recent studies employ GNNs to comprehensively digest system provenance graphs for security-critical tasks. To enhance the explainability of GNN-based security models, we introduce PROVEXPLAINER, a framework offering instance-level security-aware explanations using an interpretable surrogate model. PROVEXPLAINER's interpretable feature space consists of discriminant subgraph patterns and graph structural features, which can be directly mapped to the system provenance problem space, making the explanations human interpretable. We show how PROVEXPLAINER synergizes with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN explainers to deliver domain and instance-specific explanations. We measure the explanation quality using the Fidelity+/Fidelity- metric as used by traditional GNN explanation literature, we incorporate the precision/recall metric, where we consider the accuracy of the explanation against the ground truth, and we designed a human actionability metric based on graph traversal distance. On real-world Fileless and APT datasets, PROVEXPLAINER achieves up to 29%/27%/25%/1.4x higher Fidelity+, precision, recall, and actionability (where higher values are better), and 12% lower Fidelity- (where lower values are better) when compared against SOTA GNN explainers.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneForecast: A Universal Framework for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00338v4)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate weather forecasts are important for disaster prevention, agricultural planning, etc. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods offer physically interpretable high-accuracy predictions but are computationally expensive and fail to fully leverage rapidly growing historical data. In recent years, deep learning models have made significant progress in weather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event predictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework (OneForecast) based on graph neural networks. By combining a dynamic system perspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure and densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We introduce an adaptive messaging mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply integrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting. For high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method to mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that OneForecast performs excellently across global to regional scales and short-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.

On the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network, GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/GraphEnet-NeVi-ICCV2025.</p></details> |  |

These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMM: Quantum-Chemical Molecular Representation Learning for Combinatorial Drug Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07910v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI) between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures. Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442 substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112), and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) Predictive Intelligence in Medicine Workshop (MICCAI PRIME) 2025; 13 pages</p></details> |

This assumption does not hold in many real-world heterophilic graphs. Existing models for heterophilic graphs primarily rely on pairwise relationships, overlooking multi-scale information from higher-order structures. This leads to suboptimal performance, particularly under noise from conflicting class information across nodes. To address these challenges, we propose HPGNN, a novel model integrating Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks. HPGNN introduces an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture long-range and multi-scale node interactions. This approach reduces computational complexity and mitigates noise from surrounding information. By embedding higher-order structural information into convolutional networks, HPGNN effectively models key interactions across diverse graph dimensions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate HPGNN's effectiveness. The model achieves better performance than five out of seven state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs in downstream tasks while maintaining competitive performance on homophilic graphs. HPGNN's ability to balance multi-scale information and robustness to noise makes it a versatile solution for real-world graph learning challenges.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD), incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size, mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ARRML2025</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge-Driven Federated Graph Learning on Model Heterogeneity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12624v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated graph learning (FGL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative graph representation learning, enabling multiple parties to jointly train models while preserving data privacy. However, most existing approaches assume homogeneous client models and largely overlook the challenge of model-centric heterogeneous FGL (MHtFGL), which frequently arises in practice when organizations employ graph neural networks (GNNs) of different scales and architectures.Such architectural diversity not only undermines smooth server-side aggregation, which presupposes a unified representation space shared across clients' updates, but also further complicates the transfer and integration of structural knowledge across clients. To address this issue, we propose the Federated Graph Knowledge Collaboration (FedGKC) framework. FedGKC introduces a lightweight Copilot Model on each client to facilitate knowledge exchange while local architectures are heterogeneous across clients, and employs two complementary mechanisms: Client-side Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation, which transfers effective knowledge between local and copilot models through bidirectional distillation with multi-view perturbation; and Server-side Knowledge-Aware Model Aggregation, which dynamically assigns aggregation weights based on knowledge provided by clients. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedGKC achieves an average accuracy gain of 3.74% over baselines in MHtFGL scenarios, while maintaining excellent performance in homogeneous settings.</p></details> |  |

DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves, it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering, sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified DGTEN framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown strong performance for this problem, but costly graph construction, irregular computations, and random memory access patterns substantially limit their throughput. The recently proposed Hashing-based Efficient Point Transformer (HEPT) offers a theoretically guaranteed near-linear complexity for large point cloud processing via locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) in attention computations; however, its evaluations have largely focused on embedding quality, and the object condensation pipeline on which HEPT relies requires a post-hoc clustering step (e.g., DBScan) that can dominate runtime. In this work, we make two contributions. First, we present a unified, fair evaluation of physics tracking performance for HEPT and a representative GNN-based pipeline under the same dataset and metrics. Second, we introduce HEPTv2 by extending HEPT with a lightweight decoder that eliminates the clustering stage and directly predicts track assignments. This modification preserves HEPT's regular, hardware-friendly computations while enabling ultra-fast end-to-end inference. On the TrackML dataset, optimized HEPTv2 achieves approximately 28 ms per event on an A100 while maintaining competitive tracking efficiency. These results position HEPTv2 as a practical, scalable alternative to GNN-based pipelines for fast tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop</p></details> |

While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+ achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA (3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICTAI 2025.

Adaptive meshes improve computational efficiency by refining resolution in critical regions, but typically require task-specific heuristics or cumbersome manual design by a human expert. We propose Adaptive Meshing By Expert Reconstruction (AMBER), a supervised learning approach to mesh adaptation. Starting from a coarse mesh, AMBER iteratively predicts the sizing field, i.e., a function mapping from the geometry to the local element size of the target mesh, and uses this prediction to produce a new intermediate mesh using an out-of-the-box mesh generator. This process is enabled through a hierarchical graph neural network, and relies on data augmentation by automatically projecting expert labels onto AMBER-generated data during training. We evaluate AMBER on 2D and 3D datasets, including classical physics problems, mechanical components, and real-world industrial designs with human expert meshes. AMBER generalizes to unseen geometries and consistently outperforms multiple recent baselines, including ones using Graph and Convolutional Neural Networks, and Reinforcement Learning-based approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS2025</p></details> |

These vulnerabilities allow attackers to exploit CE for broader system attacks while enabling the propagation of malicious code across the CE network, resulting in device failures. Existing deep learning-based traffic anomaly detection systems exhibit high accuracy in traditional network environments but are often overly complex and reliant on static infrastructure, necessitating manual configuration and management. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable network model that integrates Software-defined Networking (SDN) and Compute First Networking (CFN) for next-generation CE networks. In this network model, we propose a Graph Neural Networks-based Network Anomaly Detection framework (GNN-NAD) that integrates SDN-based CE networks and enables the CFN architecture. GNN-NAD uniquely fuses a static, vulnerability-aware attack graph with dynamic traffic features, providing a holistic view of network security. The core of the framework is a GNN model (GSAGE) for graph representation learning, followed by a Random Forest (RF) classifier. This design (GSAGE+RF) demonstrates superior performance compared to existing feature selection methods. Experimental evaluations on CE environment reveal that GNN-NAD achieves superior metrics in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score, even with small sample sizes, exceeding the performance of current network anomaly detection methods. This work advances the security and efficiency of next-generation intelligent CE networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics. 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

However, existing GC methods predominantly employ classification as the surrogate task for optimization, thus excessively relying on node labels and constraining their utility in label-sparsity scenarios. More critically, this surrogate task tends to overfit class-specific information within the condensed graph, consequently restricting the generalization capabilities of GC for other downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce Contrastive Graph Condensation (CTGC), which adopts a self-supervised surrogate task to extract critical, causal information from the original graph and enhance the cross-task generalizability of the condensed graph. Specifically, CTGC employs a dual-branch framework to disentangle the generation of the node attributes and graph structures, where a dedicated structural branch is designed to explicitly encode geometric information through nodes' positional embeddings. By implementing an alternating optimization scheme with contrastive loss terms, CTGC promotes the mutual enhancement of both branches and facilitates high-quality graph generation through the model inversion technique. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CTGC excels in handling various downstream tasks with a limited number of labels, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art GC methods.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |

Algorithms are integral to robotics and safety-critical applications due to their predictable and consistent performance through logical and mathematical principles. In contrast, while neural networks are highly adaptable, handling complex, high-dimensional data and generalising across tasks, they often lack interpretability and transparency in their internal computations. To bridge the two, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, NAR-*ICP, that learns the intermediate computations of classical ICP-based registration algorithms, extending the CLRS Benchmark. We evaluate our approach across real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating its flexibility in handling complex inputs, and its potential to be used within larger learning pipelines. Our method achieves superior performance compared to the baselines, even surpassing the algorithms it was trained on, further demonstrating its ability to generalise beyond the capabilities of traditional algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 16 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

Evaluations on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that MoRE-GNN captures biologically meaningful relationships and outperforms existing methods, particularly in settings with strong inter-modality correlations. Furthermore, the learned representations allow for accurate downstream cross-modal predictions.

Machine learning approaches offer computational speedups but struggle with scalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining. To enable scalability across grid sizes and adaptability to topology changes, we propose a Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN). HH-MPNN models buses, generators, loads, shunts, transmission lines and transformers as distinct node or edge types, combined with a scalable transformer model for handling long-range dependencies. On grids from 14 to 2,000 buses, HH-MPNN achieves less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies. Applied zero-shot to thousands of unseen topologies, HH-MPNN achieves less than 3% optimality gap despite training only on default topologies. Pre-training on smaller grids also improves results on a larger grid. Computational speedups reach 1,000x to 10,000x compared to interior point solvers. These results advance practical, generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print has been submitted for review</p></details> |

We propose a novel integration framework that enables effective fusion between powerful pre-trained text encoders and Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs). Our method enhances the alignment of textual and structural representations through a bidirectional fusion mechanism and contrastive node-level optimization. To evaluate the approach, we train two variants using different PLMs: Snowflake-Embed (state-of-the-art) and GTE-base, each paired with an R-GCN backbone. Experiments on five heterophilic benchmarks demonstrate that our integration method achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, surpassing existing GNN and large language model-based approaches. Notably, Snowflake-Embed + R-GCN improves accuracy on the Texas dataset by over 8\% and on Wisconsin by nearly 5\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our fusion strategy for advancing text-rich graph representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-Aware Compound-Protein Affinity Prediction via Graph Neural Network with Group Lasso Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03318v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end explainable models for structure-activity relationship (SAR) modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as the limited number of compound-protein interaction activity data for specific protein targets, and plenty of subtle changes in molecular configuration sites significantly affecting molecular properties. We exploit pairs of molecules with activity cliffs that share scaffolds but differ at substituent sites, characterized by large potency differences for specific protein targets. We propose a framework by implementing graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage property and structure information from activity cliff pairs to predict compound-protein affinity (i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). To enhance model performance and explainability, we train GNNs with structure-aware loss functions using group lasso and sparse group lasso regularizations, which prune and highlight molecular subgraphs relevant to activity differences. We applied this framework to activity cliff data of molecules targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (PDB IDs: 1O42, 2H8H, 4MXO). Our approach improved property prediction by integrating common and uncommon node information with sparse group lasso, as reflected in reduced root mean squared error (RMSE) and improved Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC). Applying regularizations also enhances feature attribution for GNN by boosting graph-level global direction scores and improving atom-level coloring accuracy. These advances strengthen model interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly for identifying critical molecular substructures in lead optimization.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Spatiotemporal Graph Learning with Direct Volumetric Information Passing and Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18013v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven learning of physical systems has kindled significant attention, where many neural models have been developed. In particular, mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in modeling spatiotemporal dynamics across arbitrary geometric domains. However, the existing node-edge message-passing and aggregation mechanism in GNNs limits the representation learning ability. In this paper, we proposed a dual-module framework, Cell-embedded and Feature-enhanced Graph Neural Network (aka, CeFeGNN), for learning spatiotemporal dynamics. Specifically, we embed learnable cell attributions to the common node-edge message passing process, which better captures the spatial dependency of regional features. Such a strategy essentially upgrades the local aggregation scheme from first order (e.g., from edge to node) to a higher order (e.g., from volume and edge to node), which takes advantage of volumetric information in message passing. Meanwhile, a novel feature-enhanced block is designed to further improve the model's performance and alleviate the over-smoothness problem. Extensive experiments on various PDE systems and one real-world dataset demonstrate that CeFeGNN achieves superior performance compared with other baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing the Effect of Embedding Norms and Singular Values to Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06066v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the factors that contribute to the effect of oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, our analysis is based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify the extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e., adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold start" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size (i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds. This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of the GNN.</p></details> |  |

While NLI has developed many sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm: CDCL-NLI, which extends traditional NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 25,410 instances and spanning 26 languages. To address the limitations of previous methods on CDCL-NLI task, we further propose an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion with interpretability-aware prediction. Our approach leverages RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) within heterogeneous graph neural networks for cross-document context modeling, and employs a structure-aware semantic alignment based on lexical chains for cross-lingual understanding. For NLI interpretability, we develop an EDU (Elementary Discourse Unit)-level attribution framework that produces extractive explanations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's superior performance, achieving significant improvements over both conventional NLI models as well as large language models. Our work sheds light on the study of NLI and will bring research interest on cross-document cross-lingual context understanding, hallucination elimination and interpretability inference.

Top-down approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales. However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their associated uncertainty. We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport "footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole fractions. While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks Truly Effective? A Causal Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05750v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly, aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However, whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21 datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses, with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes node classes more distinguishable.

| **[QGraphLIME - Explaining Quantum Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05683v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum graph neural networks offer a powerful paradigm for learning on graph-structured data, yet their explainability is complicated by measurement-induced stochasticity and the combinatorial nature of graph structure. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a model-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as distributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations of a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their dispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance rankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate ensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of the induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and confidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on controlled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and stable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear surrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design. Collectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and structure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and lay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world datasets, as quantum resources mature.

| **[Inductive inference of gradient-boosted decision trees on graphs for insurance fraud detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05676v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due to their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a prime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals that stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple policies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find meaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance present in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and dynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies. That is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the field. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine (G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show that our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an experiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power of G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world, proprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting forest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights into the predictions made by G-GBM.</p></details> |  |

| **[Soft-Evidence Fused Graph Neural Network for Cancer Driver Gene Identification across Multi-View Biological Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06290v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying cancer driver genes (CDGs) is essential for understanding cancer mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently been employed to identify CDGs by capturing patterns in biological interaction networks. However, most GNN-based approaches rely on a single protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, ignoring complementary information from other biological networks. Some studies integrate multiple networks by aligning features with consistency constraints to learn unified gene representations for CDG identification. However, such representation-level fusion often assumes congruent gene relationships across networks, which may overlook network heterogeneity and introduce conflicting information. To address this, we propose Soft-Evidence Fusion Graph Neural Network (SEFGNN), a novel framework for CDG identification across multiple networks at the decision level. Instead of enforcing feature-level consistency, SEFGNN treats each biological network as an independent evidence source and performs uncertainty-aware fusion at the decision level using Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST). To alleviate the risk of overconfidence from DST, we further introduce a Soft Evidence Smoothing (SES) module that improves ranking stability while preserving discriminative performance. Experiments on three cancer datasets show that SEFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits strong potential in discovering novel CDGs.</p></details> | 8pages |
| **[When Does Global Attention Help? A Unified Empirical Study on Atomistic Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05583v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN - that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model development.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 8 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |
| **[Generative Dynamic Graph Representation Learning for Conspiracy Spoofing Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05562v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spoofing detection in financial trading is crucial, especially for identifying complex behaviors such as conspiracy spoofing. Traditional machine-learning approaches primarily focus on isolated node features, often overlooking the broader context of interconnected nodes. Graph-based techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have advanced the field by leveraging relational information effectively. However, in real-world spoofing detection datasets, trading behaviors exhibit dynamic, irregular patterns. Existing spoofing detection methods, though effective in some scenarios, struggle to capture the complexity of dynamic and diverse, evolving inter-node relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called the Generative Dynamic Graph Model (GDGM), which models dynamic trading behaviors and the relationships among nodes to learn representations for conspiracy spoofing detection. Specifically, our approach incorporates the generative dynamic latent space to capture the temporal patterns and evolving market conditions. Raw trading data is first converted into time-stamped sequences. Then we model trading behaviors using the neural ordinary differential equations and gated recurrent units, to generate the representation incorporating temporal dynamics of spoofing patterns. Furthermore, pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation techniques are employed to gather relevant information and enhance the detection performance for conspiratorial spoofing behaviors. Experiments conducted on spoofing detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in detection accuracy. Additionally, our spoofing detection system has been successfully deployed in one of the largest global trading markets, further validating the practical applicability and performance of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, ACM the web conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Exposure Mapping Functions for Inferring Heterogeneous Peer Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01722v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In causal inference, interference refers to the phenomenon in which the actions of peers in a network can influence an individual's outcome. Peer effect refers to the difference in counterfactual outcomes of an individual for different levels of peer exposure, the extent to which an individual is exposed to the treatments, actions, or behaviors of peers. Estimating peer effects requires deciding how to represent peer exposure. Typically, researchers define an exposure mapping function that aggregates peer treatments and outputs peer exposure. Most existing approaches for defining exposure mapping functions assume peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers. Recent studies have investigated more complex functions of peer exposure which capture that different peers can exert different degrees of influence. However, none of these works have explicitly considered the problem of automatically learning the exposure mapping function. In this work, we focus on learning this function for the purpose of estimating heterogeneous peer effects, where heterogeneity refers to the variation in counterfactual outcomes for the same peer exposure but different individual's contexts. We develop EgoNetGNN, a graph neural network (GNN)-based method, to automatically learn the appropriate exposure mapping function allowing for complex peer influence mechanisms that, in addition to peer treatments, can involve the local neighborhood structure and edge attributes. We show that GNN models that use peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers or learn peer exposure naively face difficulty accounting for such influence mechanisms. Our comprehensive evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network data shows that our method is more robust to different unknown underlying influence mechanisms when estimating heterogeneous peer effects when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fundamental Limits of Crystalline Equivariant Graph Neural Networks: A Circuit Complexity Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05494v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a core paradigm for learning on relational data. In materials science, equivariant GNNs (EGNNs) have emerged as a compelling backbone for crystalline-structure prediction, owing to their ability to respect Euclidean symmetries and periodic boundary conditions. Despite strong empirical performance, their expressive power in periodic, symmetry-constrained settings remains poorly understood. This work characterizes the intrinsic computational and expressive limits of EGNNs for crystalline-structure prediction through a circuit-complexity lens. We analyze the computations carried out by EGNN layers acting on node features, atomic coordinates, and lattice matrices, and prove that, under polynomial precision, embedding width $d=O(n)$ for $n$ nodes, $O(1)$ layers, and $O(1)$-depth, $O(n)$-width MLP instantiations of the message/update/readout maps, these models admit a simulation by a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ threshold-circuit family of polynomial size (with an explicit constant-depth bound). Situating EGNNs within $\mathsf{TC}^0$ provides a concrete ceiling on the decision and prediction problems solvable by such architectures under realistic resource constraints and clarifies which architectural modifications (e.g., increased depth, richer geometric primitives, or wider layers) are required to transcend this regime. The analysis complements Weisfeiler-Lehman style results that do not directly transfer to periodic crystals, and offers a complexity-theoretic foundation for symmetry-aware graph learning on crystalline systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentRouter: A Knowledge-Graph-Guided LLM Router for Collaborative Multi-Agent Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05445v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and agent-based frameworks have advanced rapidly, enabling diverse applications. Yet, with the proliferation of models and agentic strategies, practitioners face substantial uncertainty in selecting the best configuration for a downstream task. Prior studies show that different agents and backbones exhibit complementary strengths, and that larger models are not always superior, underscoring the need for adaptive routing mechanisms. Existing approaches to agent routing, however, often emphasize cost efficiency while overlooking the fine-grained contextual and relational structure inherent in QA tasks. In this paper, we propose tAgentRouter, a framework that formulates multi-agent QA as a knowledge-graph-guided routing problem supervised by empirical performance signals. Specifically, we convert QA instance into a knowledge graph that jointly encodes queries, contextual entities, and agents, and then train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) to propagate information across node types and produce task-aware routing distributions over agents. By leveraging soft supervision and weighted aggregation of agent outputs, AgentRouter learns principled collaboration schemes that capture the complementary strengths of diverse agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms single-agent and ensemble baselines, while generalizing across benchmarks and LLM backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of graph-supervised multi-agent routing for question answering.</p></details> |  |

Recently, intrinsically interpretable GNNs have been studied to provide insights into model predictions by identifying rationale substructures in graphs. However, existing methods face challenges when the underlying rationale subgraphs are complex and varied. In this work, we propose TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning, a novel topological framework that leverages persistent homology to identify persistent rationale subgraphs. TopInG employs a rationale filtration learning approach to model an autoregressive generation process of rationale subgraphs, and introduces a self-adjusted topological constraint, termed topological discrepancy, to enforce a persistent topological distinction between rationale subgraphs and irrelevant counterparts. We provide theoretical guarantees that our loss function is uniquely optimized by the ground truth under specific conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate TopInG's effectiveness in tackling key challenges, such as handling variform rationale subgraphs, balancing predictive performance with interpretability, and mitigating spurious correlations. Results show that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art methods on both predictive accuracy and interpretation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[CHARME: A chain-based reinforcement learning approach for the minor embedding problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07124v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum annealing (QA) has great potential to solve combinatorial optimization problems efficiently. However, the effectiveness of QA algorithms is heavily based on the embedding of problem instances, represented as logical graphs, into the quantum processing unit (QPU) whose topology is in the form of a limited connectivity graph, known as the minor embedding problem. Because the minor embedding problem is an NP-hard problem~\mbox{\cite{Goodrich2018}}, existing methods for the minor embedding problem suffer from scalability issues when faced with larger problem sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to address the minor embedding problem, named CHARME. CHARME includes three key components: a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture for policy modeling, a state transition algorithm that ensures solution validity, and an order exploration strategy for effective training. Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world instances, we demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed order exploration strategy as well as our proposed RL framework, CHARME. In particular, CHARME yields superior solutions in terms of qubit usage compared to fast embedding methods such as Minorminer and ATOM. Moreover, our method surpasses the OCT-based approach, known for its slower runtime but high-quality solutions, in several cases. In addition, our proposed exploration enhances the efficiency of the training of the CHARME framework by providing better solutions compared to the greedy strategy.</p></details> |  |
