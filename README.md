| **[Agentic Design of Compositional Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14980v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>75 pa...</summary><p>75 pages, 31 figures, Project Page: https://besiegefield.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Information Gain-based Policy Optimization: A Simple and Effective Approach for Multi-Turn LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14967v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues: (i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios, achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[CBF-RL: Safety Filtering Reinforcement Learning in Training with Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14959v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally deployed \emph{online} via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior, the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically, we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards -- enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without a runtime safety filter.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Edge devices are limited in computing power and memory, making model efficiency and compression essential. In this work, we propose EdgeNavMamba, a reinforcement learning-based framework for goal-directed navigation using an efficient Mamba object detection model. To train and evaluate the detector, we introduce a custom shape detection dataset collected in diverse indoor settings, reflecting visual cues common in real-world navigation. The object detector serves as a pre-processing module, extracting bounding boxes (BBOX) from visual input, which are then passed to an RL policy to control goal-oriented navigation. Experimental results show that the student model achieved a reduction of 67% in size, and up to 73% in energy per inference on edge devices of NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi 5, while keeping the same performance as the teacher model. EdgeNavMamba also maintains high detection accuracy in MiniWorld and IsaacLab simulators while reducing parameters by 31% compared to the baseline. In the MiniWorld simulator, the navigation policy achieves over 90% success across environments of varying complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 11th IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing and Scalable Cloud (IEEE EdgeCom 2025)</p></details> |
| **[LaSeR: Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token Self-Rewarding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14943v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score, which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time scaling performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

| **[VT-Refine: Learning Bimanual Assembly with Visuo-Tactile Feedback via Simulation Fine-Tunin](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14930v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans excel at bimanual assembly tasks by adapting to rich tactile feedback -- a capability that remains difficult to replicate in robots through behavioral cloning alone, due to the suboptimality and limited diversity of human demonstrations. In this work, we present VT-Refine, a visuo-tactile policy learning framework that combines real-world demonstrations, high-fidelity tactile simulation, and reinforcement learning to tackle precise, contact-rich bimanual assembly. We begin by training a diffusion policy on a small set of demonstrations using synchronized visual and tactile inputs. This policy is then transferred to a simulated digital twin equipped with simulated tactile sensors and further refined via large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance robustness and generalization. To enable accurate sim-to-real transfer, we leverage high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors that provide normal force signals and can be realistically modeled in parallel using GPU-accelerated simulation. Experimental results show that VT-Refine improves assembly performance in both simulation and the real world by increasing data diversity and enabling more effective policy fine-tuning.

| **[Beyond Two-Stage Training: Cooperative SFT and RL for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06948v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this decoupled two-stage approach suffers from catastrophic forgetting: second-stage RL gradually loses SFT-acquired behaviors and inefficiently explores new patterns. This study introduces a novel method for learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hard-Label Black-Box Evasion Attack against ML-based Malicious Traffic Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14906v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning (ML)-based malicious traffic detection is a promising security paradigm. It outperforms rule-based traditional detection by identifying various advanced attacks. However, the robustness of these ML models is largely unexplored, thereby allowing attackers to craft adversarial traffic examples that evade detection. Existing evasion attacks typically rely on overly restrictive conditions (e.g., encrypted protocols, Tor, or specialized setups), or require detailed prior knowledge of the target (e.g., training data and model parameters), which is impractical in realistic black-box scenarios. The feasibility of a hard-label black-box evasion attack (i.e., applicable across diverse tasks and protocols without internal target insights) thus remains an open challenge. To this end, we develop NetMasquerade, which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to manipulate attack flows to mimic benign traffic and evade detection. Specifically, we establish a tailored pre-trained model called Traffic-BERT, utilizing a network-specialized tokenizer and an attention mechanism to extract diverse benign traffic patterns. Subsequently, we integrate Traffic-BERT into the RL framework, allowing NetMasquerade to effectively manipulate malicious packet sequences based on benign traffic patterns with minimal modifications. Experimental results demonstrate that NetMasquerade enables both brute-force and stealthy attacks to evade 6 existing detection methods under 80 attack scenarios, achieving over 96.65% attack success rate. Notably, it can evade the methods that are either empirically or certifiably robust against existing evasion attacks. Finally, NetMasquerade achieves low-latency adversarial traffic generation, demonstrating its practicality in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning with Sampling: Your Base Model is Smarter Than You Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14901v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models. In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining. Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mapping Smarter, Not Harder: A Test-Time Reinforcement Learning Agent That Improves Without Labels or Model Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14900v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However, vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced, mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent: 1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\% over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient, flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategyproof Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09561v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in settings where multiple labelers may strategically misreport feedback to steer the learned policy toward their own preferences. We show that existing RLHF algorithms, including recent pluralistic methods, are not strategyproof, and that even a single strategic labeler can cause arbitrarily large misalignment with social welfare. Moreover, we prove that, in the worst case, any strategyproof RLHF algorithm must perform $k$-times worse than the optimal policy, where $k$ is the number of labelers. This suggests a fundamental trade-off between incentive alignment (ensuring labelers report truthfully) and policy alignment (maximizing social welfare). To address this, we propose the Pessimistic Median of MLEs algorithm, which, under appropriate policy coverage assumptions, is approximately strategyproof and converges to the optimal policy as the number of labelers and samples increases. Our results apply to both contextual bandits and Markov decision processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Thinker: Learning to Think Fast and Slow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21097v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be improved by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to question-answering (QA) tasks in areas such as math and coding. With a long context length, LLMs may learn to perform search, as indicated by the self-correction behavior observed in DeepSeek R1. However, this search behavior is often imprecise and lacks confidence, resulting in long, redundant responses and highlighting deficiencies in intuition and verification. Inspired by the Dual Process Theory in psychology, we introduce a simple modification to the QA task that includes four stages: Fast Thinking, where the LLM must answer within a strict token budget; Verification, where the model evaluates its initial response; Slow Thinking, where it refines the initial response with more deliberation; and Summarization, where it distills the refinement from the previous stage into precise steps. Our proposed task improves average accuracy from 25.6% to 27.3% for Qwen2.5-1.5B, and from 45.9% to 51.0% for DeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B. Notably, for Qwen2.5-1.5B, the Fast Thinking mode alone achieves 25.2% accuracy using fewer than 1000 tokens, demonstrating substantial inference efficiency gains. These findings suggest that intuition and deliberative reasoning are distinct, complementary systems benefiting from targeted training. Additionally, we have open-sourced both the trained models and the source code.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[Reinforcement Learning with Stochastic Reward Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14837v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm, based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A shorter version of this paper appeared in the Proceedings of the Thirty-Sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-22).

| **[RL-100: Performant Robotic Manipulation with Real-World Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14830v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world robotic manipulation in homes and factories demands reliability, efficiency, and robustness that approach or surpass skilled human operators. We present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning training framework built on diffusion visuomotor policies trained bu supervised learning. RL-100 introduces a three-stage pipeline. First, imitation learning leverages human priors. Second, iterative offline reinforcement learning uses an Offline Policy Evaluation procedure, abbreviated OPE, to gate PPO-style updates that are applied in the denoising process for conservative and reliable improvement. Third, online reinforcement learning eliminates residual failure modes. An additional lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the multi-step sampling process in diffusion into a single-step policy, enabling high-frequency control with an order-of-magnitude reduction in latency while preserving task performance. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and representation-agnostic and supports both 3D point clouds and 2D RGB inputs, a variety of robot platforms, and both single-step and action-chunk policies. We evaluate RL-100 on seven real-robot tasks spanning dynamic rigid-body control, such as Push-T and Agile Bowling, fluids and granular pouring, deformable cloth folding, precise dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage orange juicing. RL-100 attains 100\% success across evaluated trials for a total of 900 out of 900 episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task. The method achieves near-human teleoperation or better time efficiency and demonstrates multi-hour robustness with uninterrupted operation lasting up to two hours.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://lei-kun.github.io/RL-100/</p></details> |
| **[RoboGPT-R1: Enhancing Robot Planning with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14828v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1, a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework, supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences, followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini, by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the EmbodiedBench benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimKO: Simple Pass@K Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14807v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1 candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way to improve RLVR's exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report (20 pages, 10 figures, project page: https://spherelab.ai/simko/)</p></details> |

While end-to-end vision-based methods promise broader applicability, no system to date simultaneously achieves full sim-to-real transfer, onboard execution, and champion-level performance. In this work, we present SkyDreamer, to the best of our knowledge, the first end-to-end vision-based ADR policy that maps directly from pixel-level representations to motor commands. SkyDreamer builds on informed Dreamer, a model-based reinforcement learning approach where the world model decodes to privileged information only available during training. By extending this concept to end-to-end vision-based ADR, the world model effectively functions as an implicit state and parameter estimator, greatly improving interpretability. SkyDreamer runs fully onboard without external aid, resolves visual ambiguities by tracking progress using the state decoded from the world model's hidden state, and requires no extrinsic camera calibration, enabling rapid deployment across different drones without retraining. Real-world experiments show that SkyDreamer achieves robust, high-speed flight, executing tight maneuvers such as an inverted loop, a split-S and a ladder, reaching speeds of up to 21 m/s and accelerations of up to 6 g. It further demonstrates a non-trivial visual sim-to-real transfer by operating on poor-quality segmentation masks, and exhibits robustness to battery depletion by accurately estimating the maximum attainable motor RPM and adjusting its flight path in real-time. These results highlight SkyDreamer's adaptability to important aspects of the reality gap, bringing robustness while still achieving extremely high-speed, agile flight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Neural Descriptor Fields for Learning Contact-Aware Dynamic Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14768v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world dexterous manipulation often encounters unexpected errors and disturbances, which can lead to catastrophic failures, such as dropping the manipulated object. To address this challenge, we focus on the problem of catching a falling object while it remains within grasping range and, importantly, resetting the system to a configuration favorable for resuming the primary manipulation task. We propose Contact-Aware Dynamic Recovery (CADRE), a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a Neural Descriptor Field (NDF)-inspired module to extract implicit contact features. Compared to methods that rely solely on object pose or point cloud input, NDFs can directly reason about finger-object correspondence and adapt to different object geometries. Our experiments show that incorporating contact features improves training efficiency, enhances convergence performance for RL training, and ultimately leads to more successful recoveries. Additionally, we demonstrate that CADRE can generalize zero-shot to unseen objects with different geometries.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Cognitive-Aligned Spatio-Temporal Large Language Models For Next Point-of-Interest Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14702v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems, which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays, and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns, profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of 2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in "Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of CoAST.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning via Inverse Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20030v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the recent successes of Inverse Optimization (IO) across various application domains, we propose a novel offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) algorithm for continuous state and action spaces, leveraging the convex loss function called ``sub-optimality loss" from the IO literature. To mitigate the distribution shift commonly observed in ORL problems, we further employ a robust and non-causal Model Predictive Control (MPC) expert steering a nominal model of the dynamics using in-hindsight information stemming from the model mismatch. Unlike the existing literature, our robust MPC expert enjoys an exact and tractable convex reformulation. In the second part of this study, we show that the IO hypothesis class, trained by the proposed convex loss function, enjoys ample expressiveness and achieves competitive performance comparing with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the low-data regime of the MuJoCo benchmark while utilizing three orders of magnitude fewer parameters, thereby requiring significantly fewer computational resources. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we provide an open-source package implementing the proposed algorithms and the experiments.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[On the Generalization of SFT: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective with Reward Rectification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05629v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization.

Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast, generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads. Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a 4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust, and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Bidding Games: Reinforcement Learning for MEV Extraction on Polygon Blockchain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14642v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In blockchain networks, the strategic ordering of transactions within blocks has emerged as a significant source of profit extraction, known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). The transition from spam-based Priority Gas Auctions to structured auction mechanisms like Polygon Atlas has transformed MEV extraction from public bidding wars into sealed-bid competitions under extreme time constraints. While this shift reduces network congestion, it introduces complex strategic challenges where searchers must make optimal bidding decisions within a sub-second window without knowledge of competitor behavior or presence. Traditional game-theoretic approaches struggle in this high-frequency, partially observable environment due to their reliance on complete information and static equilibrium assumptions. We present a reinforcement learning framework for MEV extraction on Polygon Atlas and make three contributions: (1) A novel simulation environment that accurately models the stochastic arrival of arbitrage opportunities and probabilistic competition in Atlas auctions; (2) A PPO-based bidding agent optimized for real-time constraints, capable of adaptive strategy formulation in continuous action spaces while maintaining production-ready inference speeds; (3) Empirical validation demonstrating our history-conditioned agent captures 49\% of available profits when deployed alongside existing searchers and 81\% when replacing the market leader, significantly outperforming static bidding strategies. Our work establishes that reinforcement learning provides a critical advantage in high-frequency MEV environments where traditional optimization methods fail, offering immediate value for industrial participants and protocol designers alike.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATGen: Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Test Case Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14635v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, yet their outputs often contain subtle bugs, for which effective test cases are a critical bottleneck. Existing test generation methods, whether based on prompting or supervised fine-tuning, rely on static datasets. This imposes a ``fixed-difficulty ceiling'', fundamentally limiting their ability to uncover novel or more complex bugs beyond their training scope. To overcome this, we introduce ATGen, a framework that trains a test case generator via adversarial reinforcement learning. ATGen pits a test generator against an adversarial code generator that continuously crafts harder bugs to evade the current policy. This dynamic loop creates a curriculum of increasing difficulty challenging current policy. The test generator is optimized via Reinforcement Learning (RL) to jointly maximize ``Output Accuracy'' and ``Attack Success'', enabling it to learn a progressively stronger policy that breaks the fixed-difficulty ceiling of static training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ATGen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We further validate its practical utility, showing it serves as both a more effective filter for Best-of-N inference and a higher-quality reward source for training code generation models. Our work establishes a new, dynamic paradigm for improving the reliability of LLM-generated code.</p></details> |  |
| **[MR.Rec: Synergizing Memory and Reasoning for Personalized Recommendation Assistant with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14629v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems faces key challenges in delivering deep personalization and intelligent reasoning, especially for interactive scenarios. Current methods are often constrained by limited context windows and single-turn reasoning, hindering their ability to capture dynamic user preferences and proactively reason over recommendation contexts. To address these limitations, we propose MR.Rec, a novel framework that synergizes memory and reasoning for LLM-based recommendations. To achieve personalization, we develop a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that efficiently indexes and retrieves relevant external memory to enhance LLM personalization capabilities. Furthermore, to enable the synergy between memory and reasoning, our RAG system goes beyond conventional query-based retrieval by integrating reasoning enhanced memory retrieval. Finally, we design a reinforcement learning framework that trains the LLM to autonomously learn effective strategies for both memory utilization and reasoning refinement. By combining dynamic memory retrieval with adaptive reasoning, this approach ensures more accurate, context-aware, and highly personalized recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR.Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics, validating its efficacy in delivering intelligent and personalized recommendations. We will release code and data upon paper notification.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLAIF-SPA: Optimizing LLM-based Emotional Speech Synthesis via RLAIF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14628v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech, but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech, leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization. Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code-driven Number Sequence Calculation: Enhancing the inductive Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14620v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks. Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections, thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking. Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation, enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures. Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-based Visual Question Answer with Multimodal Processing, Retrieval and Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14605v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

However, both offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed $\textbf{RPEX}$: $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{EX}$pansion. Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios.

| **[Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14545v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues; and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14 challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating scalable web agent training.</p></details> | Working in progress |
| **[Learning to Undo: Rollback-Augmented Reinforcement Learning with Reversibility Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14503v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a reversible learning framework to improve the robustness and efficiency of value based Reinforcement Learning agents, addressing vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible environments. The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an empirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and a selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action estimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior state within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term during temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility awareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a selective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly lower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined threshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather than progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids catastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted rollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the CliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8 percent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi v3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9 percent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while also sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies confirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these safety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable sequential decision making.</p></details> | Submitted PLOS ONE |
| **[A Hybrid Machine Learning Approach for Synthetic Data Generation with Post Hoc Calibration for Clinical Tabular Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10513v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare research and development face significant obstacles due to data scarcity and stringent privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR, restricting access to essential real-world medical data. These limitations impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics while safeguarding patient privacy. We introduce a novel hybrid framework for high-fidelity healthcare data synthesis integrating five augmentation methods: noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) sampling, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around 0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%, confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable to models trained on real data. This scalable, privacy-preserving approach matches state-of-the-art methods, sets new benchmarks for joint-distribution fidelity in healthcare, and supports sensitive AI applications.</p></details> |  |

By decoupling tool selection from response generation, NLT eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4 percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.</p></details> | 31 pages, 7 figures |

Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn instruction following.

Recent RLVR works that operate under the zero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still depend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training. The scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the long-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already evident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a hypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by humans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To address these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in which a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any external data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability by using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and verify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide open-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without external data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens of thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is compatible with various model classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rediscovering Entropy Regularization: Adaptive Coefficient Unlocks Its Potential for LLM Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10959v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

While recent benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75%) and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hi-Agent: Hierarchical Vision-Language Agents for Mobile Device Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14388v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark, significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based (AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones, showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEPO: Group Expectation Policy Optimization for Stable Heterogeneous Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17850v7)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized training becomes essential. However, traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, crucial for enhancing large model post-training, cannot adapt to decentralized distributed training due to the tight coupling between parameter learning and rollout sampling. For this, we propose HeteroRL, a heterogeneous RL architecture that decouples these processes, enabling stable training across geographically distributed nodes connected via the Internet. The core component is Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO), an asynchronous RL algorithm robust to latency caused by network delays or heterogeneity in computational resources. Our study reveals that high latency significantly increases KL divergence, leading to higher variance of importance weights and training instability. GEPO mitigates this issue by using group expectation weighting to exponentially reduce the variance of importance weights, with theoretical guarantees. Experiments show GEPO achieves superior stability - only a 3% performance drop from online to 1800s latency-and reduces the best-to-last gap by 85% versus GSPO (1.8 vs. 12.0) while attaining the highest scores, highlighting its effectiveness in decentralized, resource-heterogeneous environments.</p></details> |  |

Our approach trains a family of risk-conditioned policies using a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constrained policy optimization technique that provides improved stability and sample efficiency. At deployment, we adaptively select the best performing policy from the family of policies using a multi-armed bandit framework that uses only observed episodic returns, without any privileged environment information, and adapts to unknown conditions on the fly. Hence, we train quadrupedal locomotion policies at various levels of robustness using CVaR and adaptively select the desired level of robustness online to ensure performance in unknown environments. We evaluate our method in simulation across eight unseen settings (by changing dynamics, contacts, sensing noise, and terrain) and on a Unitree Go2 robot in previously unseen terrains. Our risk-aware policy attains nearly twice the mean and tail performance in unseen environments compared to other baselines and our bandit-based adaptation selects the best-performing risk-aware policy in unknown terrain within two minutes of operation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Reasoning Embedding Models: Towards Next-Generation Dense Retrieval Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14321v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern e-commerce search systems, dense retrieval has become an indispensable component. By computing similarities between query and item (product) embeddings, it efficiently selects candidate products from large-scale repositories. With the breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs), mainstream embedding models have gradually shifted from BERT to LLMs for more accurate text modeling. However, these models still adopt direct-embedding methods, and the semantic accuracy of embeddings remains inadequate. Therefore, contrastive learning is heavily employed to achieve tight semantic alignment between positive pairs. Consequently, such models tend to capture statistical co-occurrence patterns in the training data, biasing them toward shallow lexical and semantic matches. For difficult queries exhibiting notable lexical disparity from target items, the performance degrades significantly. In this work, we propose the Large Reasoning Embedding Model (LREM), which novelly integrates reasoning processes into representation learning. For difficult queries, LREM first conducts reasoning to achieve a deep understanding of the original query, and then produces a reasoning-augmented query embedding for retrieval. This reasoning process effectively bridges the semantic gap between original queries and target items, significantly improving retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training process: the first stage optimizes the LLM on carefully curated Query-CoT-Item triplets with SFT and InfoNCE losses to establish preliminary reasoning and embedding capabilities, and the second stage further refines the reasoning trajectories via reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive offline and online experiments validate the effectiveness of LREM, leading to its deployment on China's largest e-commerce platform since August 2025.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating & Reducing Deceptive Dialogue From Language Models with Multi-turn RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14318v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently, poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior, combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation, and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly, models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average. Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Measuring in Reinforcement Learning With Delayed Negative Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14315v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state. The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.</p></details> |  |
| **[R1-Ranker: Teaching LLM Rankers to Reason](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21638v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning abilities in domains like mathematics, coding, and scientific problem-solving, yet their potential for ranking tasks, where prime examples include retrieval, recommender systems, and LLM routing, remains underexplored. Ranking requires complex reasoning across heterogeneous candidates, but existing LLM-based rankers are often domain-specific, tied to fixed backbones, and lack iterative refinement, limiting their ability to fully exploit LLMs' reasoning potential. To address these challenges, we propose R1-Ranker, a reasoning-incentive framework built on reinforcement learning, with two complementary designs: DRanker, which generates full rankings in one shot, and IRanker, which decomposes ranking into an iterative elimination process with step-wise rewards to encourage deeper reasoning. We evaluate unified R1-Rankers on nine datasets spanning recommendation, routing, and passage ranking, showing that IRanker-3B consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses larger 7B models on some tasks, and yields a 15.7% average relative improvement. Ablation and generalization experiments further confirm the critical role of reinforcement learning and iterative reasoning, with IRanker-3B improving zero-shot performance by over 9% on out-of-domain tasks and reasoning traces boosting other LLMs by up to 22.87%. These results demonstrate that unifying diverse ranking tasks with a single reasoning-driven foundation model is both effective and essential for advancing LLM reasoning in ranking scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While compliant robot-human collaboration has been extensively developed for robotic arms, enabling compliant human-humanoid collaboration remains largely unexplored due to humanoids' complex whole-body dynamics. In this paper, we propose a proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach, COLA, that combines leader and follower behaviors within a single policy. The model is trained in a closed-loop environment with dynamic object interactions to predict object motion patterns and human intentions implicitly, enabling compliant collaboration to maintain load balance through coordinated trajectory planning. We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulator and real-world experiments on collaborative carrying tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness, generalization, and robustness of our model across various terrains and objects. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our model reduces human effort by 24.7%. compared to baseline approaches while maintaining object stability. Real-world experiments validate robust collaborative carrying across different object types (boxes, desks, stretchers, etc.) and movement patterns (straight-line, turning, slope climbing). Human user studies with 23 participants confirm an average improvement of 27.4% compared to baseline models. Our method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying without requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project and code are available at https://ali-videoai.github.io/identity_page</p></details> |
| **[Identity-Preserving Image-to-Video Generation via Reward-Guided Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14255v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

| **[Towards Agentic Self-Learning LLMs in Search Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14253v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator, a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically, ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines (e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling. This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents.

Existing approaches integrate perception via Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or adaptive decision-making through Reinforcement Learning (RL), but they fail to capture dynamic object interactions or require task-specific training, limiting their real-world applicability. We introduce APEX (Anticipatory Physics-Enhanced Execution), a framework that equips LLMs with physics-driven foresight for real-time task planning. APEX constructs structured graphs to identify and model the most relevant dynamic interactions in the environment, providing LLMs with explicit physical state updates. Simultaneously, APEX provides low-latency forward simulations of physically feasible actions, allowing LLMs to select optimal strategies based on predictive outcomes rather than static observations. We evaluate APEX on three benchmarks designed to assess perception, prediction, and decision-making: (1) Physics Reasoning Benchmark, testing causal inference and object motion prediction; (2) Tetris, evaluating whether physics-informed prediction enhances decision-making performance in long-horizon planning tasks; (3) Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance, assessing the immediate integration of perception and action feasibility analysis. APEX significantly outperforms standard LLMs and VLM-based models, demonstrating the necessity of explicit physics reasoning for bridging the gap between language-based intelligence and real-world task execution. The source code and experiment setup are publicly available at https://github.com/hwj20/APEX_EXP .</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Regularized Distributionally Robust Markov Decision Processes with Linear Function Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14246v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ. We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics. Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret. To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally, empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate the robustness of DR-RPO.</p></details> | 53 pages, 8 figures |

However, many approaches struggle with reliability in the target domain, an issue particularly critical in medical image segmentation, where accuracy and anatomical validity are essential. This challenge is further exacerbated in spatio-temporal data, where the lack of temporal consistency can significantly degrade segmentation quality, and particularly in echocardiography, where the presence of artifacts and noise can further hinder segmentation performance. To address these issues, we present RL4Seg3D, an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D + time echocardiography segmentation. RL4Seg3D integrates novel reward functions and a fusion scheme to enhance key landmark precision in its segmentations while processing full-sized input videos. By leveraging reinforcement learning for image segmentation, our approach improves accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while also providing, as a beneficial side effect, a robust uncertainty estimator, which can be used at test time to further enhance segmentation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on over 30,000 echocardiographic videos, showing that it outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques without the need for any labels on the target domain.

To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of spatial computing communications (SCC), a framework designed to meet the latency and energy demands of multi-user VR over distributed mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. SCC jointly represents the physical space, defined by users and base stations, and the virtual space, representing shared immersive environments, using a probabilistic model of user dynamics and resource requirements. The resource deployment task is then formulated as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem that simultaneously minimizes system latency and energy consumption across distributed MEC resources. To solve this problem, we propose MO-CMPO, a multi-objective consistency model with policy optimization that integrates supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by preference weights. Leveraging a sparse graph neural network (GNN), MO-CMPO efficiently generates Pareto-optimal solutions. Simulations with real-world New Radio base station datasets demonstrate that MO-CMPO achieves superior hypervolume performance and significantly lower inference latency than baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis reveals practical deployment patterns: latency-oriented solutions favor local MEC execution to reduce transmission delay, while energy-oriented solutions minimize redundant placements to save energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submited to IEEE journal</p></details> |

In this paper, we developed large language model (LLM)-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive S-surface controller for AUVs. Specifically, LLMs are introduced for the joint optimization of controller parameters and reward functions in RL training. Using multi-modal and structured explicit task feedback, LLMs enable joint adjustments, balance multiple objectives, and enhance task-oriented performance and adaptability. In the proposed controller, the RL policy focuses on upper-level tasks, outputting task-oriented high-level commands that the S-surface controller then converts into control signals, ensuring cancellation of nonlinear effects and unpredictable external disturbances in extreme sea conditions. Under extreme sea conditions involving complex terrain, waves, and currents, the proposed controller demonstrates superior performance and adaptability in high-level tasks such as underwater target tracking and data collection, outperforming traditional PID and SMC controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE/RSJ IROS 2025</p></details> |

Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. In this paper, we investigate the Soft Thinking capabilities of various LLMs through a systematic analysis of their internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the prevailing belief that Soft Thinking supports parallel exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs behave as single-threaded reasoners--they predominantly rely on the token with the highest probability in the soft input to predict the next step. This behavior induces a greedy feedback loop that suppresses alternative reasoning paths and undermines the benefits of transmitting richer information via Soft Tokens. To address this Greedy Pitfall, we propose Stochastic Soft Thinking, which introduces stochasticity to break free from this Greedy Pitfall. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness--particularly with the Gumbel-Softmax trick--can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks. We further demonstrate that Stochastic Soft Thinking exhibits stronger exploration potential compared to conventional COT. Our findings deepen the understanding of continuous reasoning and establish the foundation for future work on improving Soft Thinking with Reinforcement Learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, working in progress</p></details> |

However, practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore, the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure, vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, chapter for edited book (Federated Learning: Foundations and Applications)</p></details> |

SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision. Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.</p></details> |  |

However, the inference of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step sampling during flow policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two algorithm variants based on rectified flow policy and MeanFlow policy, respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo and visual DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy baselines while requiring orders of magnitude less computational cost during inference.</p></details> |  |

We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs). Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification -- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks; and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot generalization.</p></details> |  |

While guaranteeing DP generally requires explicitly injecting noise either to the algorithm itself or to its outputs, the intrinsic randomness of existing algorithms presents an opportunity to achieve DP ``for free''. In this work, we explore the role of regularization in achieving DP across three different decision-making problems: multi-armed bandits, linear contextual bandits, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in offline data settings. We show that adding KL-regularization to the learning objective (a common approach in optimization algorithms) makes the action sampled from the resulting stochastic policy itself differentially private. This offers a new route to privacy guarantees without additional noise injection, while also preserving the inherent advantage of regularization in enhancing performance.</p></details> |  |

We study Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL), a self-supervised algorithm capable of solving challenging long-horizon goal-reaching tasks without external rewards or curricula. We combine theoretical analysis of the algorithm's objective function with controlled experiments to understand what drives its exploration. We show that SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by its learned representations. These representations automatically modify the reward landscape to promote exploration before reaching the goal and exploitation thereafter. Our experiments also demonstrate that these exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank representations of the state space rather than from neural network function approximation. Our improved understanding enables us to adapt SGCRL to perform safety-aware exploration.</p></details> |  |

However, real tactile sensors often face hardware limitations such as high costs and fragility, and deployment challenges involving calibration and variations between different sensors, while vision-only policies struggle with satisfactory performance. Inspired by humans' ability to infer tactile states from vision, we propose ViTacGen, a novel robot manipulation framework designed for visual robotic pushing with vision-to-touch generation in reinforcement learning to eliminate the reliance on high-resolution real tactile sensors, enabling effective zero-shot deployment on visual-only robotic systems. Specifically, ViTacGen consists of an encoder-decoder vision-to-touch generation network that generates contact depth images, a standardized tactile representation, directly from visual image sequence, followed by a reinforcement learning policy that fuses visual-tactile data with contrastive learning based on visual and generated tactile observations. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in both simulation and real world experiments, demonstrating its superior performance and achieving a success rate of up to 86\%.</p></details> |  |

Existing AR video diffusion models are limited to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control, then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B parameters.

Coordinated building energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems. Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees, and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management. STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and maintains effectiveness across different building types.</p></details> |  |

While deterministic actions can be crafted by sampling or optimizing with certain constraints, planning actions with uncertainty, i.e., probabilistic actions, remains a challenge for TAMP. On the contrary, Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels in acquiring versatile, yet short-horizon, manipulation skills that are robust with uncertainties. In this letter, we design a method that integrates RL skills into TAMP pipelines. Besides the policy, a RL skill is defined with data-driven logical components that enable the skill to be deployed by symbolic planning. A plan refinement sub-routine is designed to further tackle the inevitable effect uncertainties. In the experiments, we compare our method with baseline hierarchical planning from both TAMP and RL fields and illustrate the strength of the method. The results show that by embedding RL skills, we extend the capability of TAMP to domains with probabilistic skills, and improve the planning efficiency compared to the previous methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Diffusion-Refined Planner with Reinforcement Learning Priors for Confined-Space Parking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14000v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for parking has increased the need for automated parking planning methods that can operate reliably in confined spaces. In restricted and complex environments, high-precision maneuvers are required to achieve a high success rate in planning, yet existing approaches often rely on explicit action modeling, which faces challenges when accurately modeling the optimal action distribution. In this paper, we propose DRIP, a diffusion-refined planner anchored in reinforcement learning (RL) prior action distribution, in which an RL-pretrained policy provides prior action distributions to regularize the diffusion training process. During the inference phase the denoising process refines these coarse priors into more precise action distributions. By steering the denoising trajectory through the reinforcement learning prior distribution during training, the diffusion model inherits a well-informed initialization, resulting in more accurate action modeling, a higher planning success rate, and reduced inference steps. We evaluate our approach across parking scenarios with varying degrees of spatial constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves planning performance in confined-space parking environments while maintaining strong generalization in common scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation, proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware video generation and broader applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sihuiji.github.io/PhysMaster-Page/</p></details> |

Existing approaches to combat this rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex, multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating. Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer, competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x. It also transfers significantly to diverse out-of-distribution ReasoningGym domains and long-context benchmarks, indicating broader generalization. Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1 therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon problems using only existing data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, 31 pages, 8 figures, long-horizon reasoning</p></details> |
| **[Breadcrumbs Reasoning: Memory-Efficient Reasoning with Compression Beacons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13797v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scalability of large language models for long-context reasoning is severely constrained by the linear growth of their Transformer key-value cache, which incurs significant memory and computational costs. We posit that as a model generates reasoning tokens, the informational value of past generated tokens diminishes, creating an opportunity for compression. In this work, we propose to periodically compress the generation KV cache with a learned, special-purpose token and evict compressed entries. We train the model to perform this compression via a modified joint distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Our training method minimizes overhead over the conventional RL process, as it leverages RL outputs for distillation. Empirically, our method achieves a superior memory-accuracy Pareto frontier compared to both the model without cache compression and training-free compression techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flattening Hierarchies with Policy Bootstrapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14975v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a promising approach for pretraining generalist policies on large datasets of reward-free trajectories, akin to the self-supervised objectives used to train foundation models for computer vision and natural language processing. However, scaling GCRL to longer horizons remains challenging due to the combination of sparse rewards and discounting, which obscures the comparative advantages of primitive actions with respect to distant goals. Hierarchical RL methods achieve strong empirical results on long-horizon goal-reaching tasks, but their reliance on modular, timescale-specific policies and subgoal generation introduces significant additional complexity and hinders scaling to high-dimensional goal spaces. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to train a flat (non-hierarchical) goal-conditioned policy by bootstrapping on subgoal-conditioned policies with advantage-weighted importance sampling. Our approach eliminates the need for a generative model over the (sub)goal space, which we find is key for scaling to high-dimensional control in large state spaces. We further show that existing hierarchical and bootstrapping-based approaches correspond to specific design choices within our derivation. Across a comprehensive suite of state- and pixel-based locomotion and manipulation benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses state-of-the-art offline GCRL algorithms and scales to complex, long-horizon tasks where prior approaches fail.

In order to improve the robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial attack, such as state observation attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Art of Scaling Reinforcement Learning Compute for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13786v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets, there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum, and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long achieved in pre-training.</p></details> | 28 pages, 20 figures |
| **[Egocentric Visual Navigation through Hippocampal Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09951v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential activation of place-tuned neurons in an animal during navigation is typically interpreted as reflecting the sequence of input from adjacent positions along the trajectory. More recent theories about such place cells suggest sequences arise from abstract cognitive objectives like planning. Here, we propose a mechanistic and parsimonious interpretation to complement these ideas: hippocampal sequences arise from intrinsic recurrent circuitry that propagates activity without readily available input, acting as a temporal memory buffer for extremely sparse inputs. We implement a minimal sequence generator inspired by neurobiology and pair it with an actor-critic learner for egocentric visual navigation. Our agent reliably solves a continuous maze without explicit geometric cues, with performance depending on the length of the recurrent sequence. Crucially, the model outperforms LSTM cores under sparse input conditions (16 channels, ~2.5% activity), but not under dense input, revealing a strong interaction between representational sparsity and memory architecture. In contrast to LSTM agents, hidden sequence units develop localized place fields, distance-dependent spatial kernels, and task-dependent remapping, while inputs orthogonalize and spatial information increases across layers. These phenomena align with neurobiological data and are causal to performance. Together, our results show that sparse input synergizes with sequence-generating dynamics, providing both a mechanistic account of place cell sequences in the mammalian hippocampus and a simple inductive bias for reinforcement learning based on sparse egocentric inputs in navigation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 21 figures.

| **[Asymptotically optimal reinforcement learning in Block Markov Decision Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13748v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces. Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but where transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent advances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this latent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to determine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now addressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages clustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed effectively speed up learning. Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first learns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an optimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm achieves a regret that is $O(\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible to clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the cardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\cdot)$ holds up to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior bound, $O(\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large. Moreover, we prove that no algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this same class of BMDPs. This establishes that, on this class, the algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality.</p></details> | 74 pages, 3 figures |
| **[From Refusal to Recovery: A Control-Theoretic Approach to Generative AI Guardrails](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13727v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem: harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii) proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simplicial Embeddings Improve Sample Efficiency in Actor-Critic Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13704v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization; unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in runtime speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning for Data Collection Scheduling in UAV-assisted Sensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14556v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being utilized in various private and commercial applications, e.g., traffic control, parcel delivery, and Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. Machine Learning (ML) methods used in UAV-Assisted Sensor Networks (UASNETs) and, especially, in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) face challenges such as complex and lengthy model training, gaps between simulation and reality, and low sampling efficiency, which conflict with the urgency of emergencies, such as SAR missions. In this paper, an In-Context Learning (ICL)-Data Collection Scheduling (ICLDC) system is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The UAV collects sensory data and transmits it to a Large Language Model (LLM), which creates a task description in natural language. From this description, the UAV receives a data collection schedule that must be executed. A verifier ensures safe UAV operations by evaluating the schedules generated by the LLM and overriding unsafe schedules based on predefined rules. The system continuously adapts by incorporating feedback into the task descriptions and using this for future decisions. This method is tested against jailbreaking attacks, where the task description is manipulated to undermine network performance, highlighting the vulnerability of LLMs to such attacks. The proposed ICLDC significantly reduces cumulative packet loss compared to both the DQN and Maximum Channel Gain baselines. ICLDC presents a promising direction for intelligent scheduling and control in UASNETs.</p></details> |  |

We identify two key obstacles to its mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward models overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of suitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level constraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we propose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant information to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that reward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent space, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution. Motivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that penalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape while maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying reward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online mitigation such as early stopping. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets confirm the generality of our findings, the effectiveness of InfoRM and IBL, and the reliability of MOP as a diagnostic tool-collectively advancing the state of RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 36 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.</p></details> | 34 pages, 25 figures |

| **[Extended Friction Models for the Physics Simulation of Servo Actuators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08650v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate physical simulation is crucial for the development and validation of control algorithms in robotic systems. Recent works in Reinforcement Learning (RL) take notably advantage of extensive simulations to produce efficient robot control. State-of-the-art servo actuator models generally fail at capturing the complex friction dynamics of these systems. This limits the transferability of simulated behaviors to real-world applications. In this work, we present extended friction models that allow to more accurately simulate servo actuator dynamics. We propose a comprehensive analysis of various friction models, present a method for identifying model parameters using recorded trajectories from a pendulum test bench, and demonstrate how these models can be integrated into physics engines. The proposed friction models are validated on four distinct servo actuators and tested on 2R manipulators, showing significant improvements in accuracy over the standard Coulomb-Viscous model. Our results highlight the importance of considering advanced friction effects in the simulation of servo actuators to enhance the realism and reliability of robotic simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Illuminates LLM Reasoning: The Preplan-and-Anchor Rhythm Enables Fine-Grained Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13554v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics: 1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Tandem Training for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13551v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents, with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.</p></details> |  |

A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}oordinating \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.</p></details> |  |

In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of $\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size. In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log (N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space $\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF. As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces a novel approach to enhance quadruped locomotion robustness by training the Unitree Go2 robot on an oscillating bridge - a 13.24-meter steel-and-concrete structure with a 2.0 Hz eigenfrequency designed to perturb locomotion. Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm in a MuJoCo simulation, we trained 15 distinct locomotion policies, combining five gaits (trot, pace, bound, free, default) with three training conditions: rigid bridge and two oscillating bridge setups with differing height regulation strategies (relative to bridge surface or ground). Domain randomization ensured zero-shot transfer to the real-world bridge. Our results demonstrate that policies trained on the oscillating bridge exhibit superior stability and adaptability compared to those trained on rigid surfaces. Our framework enables robust gait patterns even without prior bridge exposure. These findings highlight the potential of simulation-based RL to improve quadruped locomotion during dynamic ground perturbations, offering insights for designing robots capable of traversing vibrating environments.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing RL approaches are tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

In this paper, we show that transformers can be strong baselines for continuous control in online model-free RL. We investigate key design questions: how to condition inputs, share components between actor and critic, and slice sequential data for training. Our experiments reveal stable architectural and training strategies enabling competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks, and in both vector- and image-based settings. These findings offer practical guidance for applying transformers in online RL.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces an offline-to-online framework that trains policies on clean data and then performs adversarial fine-tuning, where perturbations are injected into executed actions to induce compensatory behavior and improve resilience. A performance-aware curriculum further adjusts the perturbation probability during training via an exponential-moving-average signal, balancing robustness and stability throughout the learning process. Experiments on continuous-control locomotion tasks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently improves robustness over offline-only baselines and converges faster than training from scratch. Matching the fine-tuning and evaluation conditions yields the strongest robustness to action-space perturbations, while the adaptive curriculum strategy mitigates the degradation of nominal performance observed with the linear curriculum strategy. Overall, the results show that adversarial fine-tuning enables adaptive and robust control under uncertain environments, bridging the gap between offline efficiency and online adaptability.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

Recently, MARL models, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep Q-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging sequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance performance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in which agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action Decisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which agents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence of action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and predict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a Transformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the sequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL architecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next agent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss function to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential decision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed AOAD-MAT model outperforms existing MAT and other baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of adjusting the AOAD order in MARL.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is an extended version of the work accepted as a short paper at the 26th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Multi-Agent Systems (PRIMA 2025).

Leveraging the Duncan-Guttman matrix identity, the parameter update is obtained by factorizing a matrix which has the size of the mini-batch. This is particularly advantageous for large-scale machine learning problems where the dimension of the neural network parameter vector is several orders of magnitude larger than the batch size. Additionally, we show how improvements such as line search, adaptive regularization, and momentum can be seamlessly added to EGN to further accelerate the algorithm. Moreover, under mild assumptions, we prove that our algorithm converges in expectation to a stationary point of the objective. Finally, our numerical experiments demonstrate that EGN consistently exceeds, or at most matches the generalization performance of well-tuned SGD, Adam, GAF, SQN, and SGN optimizers across various supervised and reinforcement learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Neurocomputing (2025).

| **[Distributed MPC-based Coordination of Traffic Perimeter and Signal Control: A Lexicographic Optimization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04038v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a comprehensive strategy that integrates traffic perimeter control with traffic signal control to alleviate congestion in an urban traffic network (UTN). The strategy is formulated as a lexicographic multi-objective optimization problem, starting with the regulation of traffic inflows at boundary junctions to maximize the capacity while ensuring a smooth operation of the UTN. Following this, the signal timings at internal junctions are collaboratively optimized to enhance overall traffic conditions under the regulated inflows. The use of a model predictive control (MPC) approach ensures that the control solution adheres to safety and capacity constraints within the network. To address the computational complexity of the problem, the UTN is divided into subnetworks, each managed by a local agent. A distributed solution method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is employed, allowing each agent to determine its optimal control decisions using local information from its subnetwork and neighboring agents. Numerical simulations using VISSIM and MATLAB demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed traffic control strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[FuzzyLight: A Robust Two-Stage Fuzzy Approach for Traffic Signal Control Works in Real Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15820v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial in mitigating urban congestion and reducing emissions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several real-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor accuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data transmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions. (2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could be unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP) selection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on TSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting safety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust two-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing and RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It employs fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances the efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during training and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It works in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior performance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results indicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to expert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six real-world datasets with transmission noise.

| **[Reinforcement Learning Based Traffic Signal Design to Minimize Queue Lengths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21745v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial for reducing congestion, travel delays, pollution, and for ensuring road safety. Traditional approaches, such as fixed signal control and actuated control, often struggle to handle dynamic traffic patterns. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive TSC framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL), using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to minimize total queue lengths across all signal phases. The challenge of efficiently representing highly stochastic traffic conditions for an RL controller is addressed through multiple state representations, including an expanded state space, an autoencoder representation, and a K-Planes-inspired representation. The proposed algorithm has been implemented using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator and demonstrates superior performance over both traditional methods and other conventional RL-based approaches in reducing queue lengths. The best performing configuration achieves an approximately 29% reduction in average queue lengths compared to the traditional Webster method. Furthermore, comparative evaluation of alternative reward formulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed queue-based approach, showcasing the potential for scalable and adaptive urban traffic management.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Distribution Shift Problem in Transportation Networks using Reinforcement Learning and AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15291v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart transportation networks has increased significantly in the last few years. Among these ML and AI approaches, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to be a very promising approach by several authors. However, a problem with using Reinforcement Learning in Traffic Signal Control is the reliability of the trained RL agents due to the dynamically changing distribution of the input data with respect to the distribution of the data used for training. This presents a major challenge and a reliability problem for the trained network of AI agents and could have very undesirable and even detrimental consequences if a suitable solution is not found. Several researchers have tried to address this problem using different approaches. In particular, Meta Reinforcement Learning (Meta RL) promises to be an effective solution. In this paper, we evaluate and analyze a state-of-the-art Meta RL approach called MetaLight and show that, while under certain conditions MetaLight can indeed lead to reasonably good results, under some other conditions it might not perform well (with errors of up to 22%), suggesting that Meta RL schemes are often not robust enough and can even pose major reliability problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic Co-Simulation Framework Empowered by Infrastructure Camera Sensing and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03925v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic simulations are commonly used to optimize urban traffic flow, with reinforcement learning (RL) showing promising potential for automated traffic signal control, particularly in intelligent transportation systems involving connected automated vehicles. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is particularly effective for learning control strategies for traffic lights in a network using iterative simulations. However, existing methods often assume perfect vehicle detection, which overlooks real-world limitations related to infrastructure availability and sensor reliability. This study proposes a co-simulation framework integrating CARLA and SUMO, which combines high-fidelity 3D modeling with large-scale traffic flow simulation. Cameras mounted on traffic light poles within the CARLA environment use a YOLO-based computer vision system to detect and count vehicles, providing real-time traffic data as input for adaptive signal control in SUMO. MARL agents trained with four different reward structures leverage this visual feedback to optimize signal timings and improve network-wide traffic flow. Experiments in a multi-intersection test-bed demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MARL approach in enhancing traffic conditions using real-time camera based detection. The framework also evaluates the robustness of MARL under faulty or sparse sensing and compares the performance of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for vehicle detection. Results show that while better accuracy improves performance, MARL agents can still achieve significant improvements with imperfect detection, demonstrating scalability and adaptability for real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiLight: A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework with Global Adversarial Guidance for Large-Scale Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14391v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is essential for mitigating urban congestion, yet existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods face challenges in scaling to large networks while maintaining global coordination. Centralized RL suffers from scalability issues, while decentralized approaches often lack unified objectives, resulting in limited network-level efficiency. In this paper, we propose HiLight, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with global adversarial guidance for large-scale TSC. HiLight consists of a high-level Meta-Policy, which partitions the traffic network into subregions and generates sub-goals using a Transformer-LSTM architecture, and a low-level Sub-Policy, which controls individual intersections with global awareness. To improve the alignment between global planning and local execution, we introduce an adversarial training mechanism, where the Meta-Policy generates challenging yet informative sub-goals, and the Sub-Policy learns to surpass these targets, leading to more effective coordination. We evaluate HiLight across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and additionally construct a large-scale Manhattan network with diverse traffic conditions, including peak transitions, adverse weather, and holiday surges. Experimental results show that HiLight exhibits significant advantages in large-scale scenarios and remains competitive across standard benchmarks of varying sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvolveSignal: A Large Language Model Powered Coding Agent for Discovering Traffic Signal Control Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03335v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator) and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers. This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Traffic Signal Control with Predictable Cycle Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03118v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile, the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the best performance over all datasets against baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Goal-Conditioned Data Augmentation for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20519v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from pre-collected offline datasets, relaxing the need to interact directly with the environment. However, limited by the quality of offline datasets, it generally fails to learn well-qualified policies in suboptimal datasets. To address datasets with insufficient optimal demonstrations, we introduce Goal-cOnditioned Data Augmentation (GODA), a novel goal-conditioned diffusion-based method for augmenting samples with higher quality. Leveraging recent advancements in generative modelling, GODA incorporates a novel return-oriented goal condition with various selection mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a controllable scaling technique to provide enhanced return-based guidance during data sampling. GODA learns a comprehensive distribution representation of the original offline datasets while generating new data with selectively higher-return goals, thereby maximizing the utility of limited optimal demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a novel adaptive gated conditioning method for processing noisy inputs and conditions, enhancing the capture of goal-oriented guidance. We conduct experiments on the D4RL benchmark and real-world challenges, specifically traffic signal control (TSC) tasks, to demonstrate GODA's effectiveness in enhancing data quality and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art data augmentation methods across various offline RL algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Contextual MARL (cMARL) addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts. Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at https://github.com/DaRL-LibSignal/cMALC-D.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A shorter version has been accepted to the 2025 Conference on Information and Knowledge Management</p></details> |

This issue is particularly pressing in light of the recent growing interest in designing graph foundation models. These models are supposed to be able to transfer to diverse graph datasets from different domains, and yet the proposed graph foundation models are often evaluated on a very limited set of datasets from narrow applications. To alleviate this issue, we introduce GraphLand: a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction from a range of different industrial applications. GraphLand allows evaluating graph ML models on a wide range of graphs with diverse sizes, structural characteristics, and feature sets, all in a unified setting. Further, GraphLand allows investigating such previously underexplored research questions as how realistic temporal distributional shifts under transductive and inductive settings influence graph ML model performance. To mimic realistic industrial settings, we use GraphLand to compare GNNs with gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) models that are popular in industrial applications and show that GBDTs provided with additional graph-based input features can sometimes be very strong baselines. Further, we evaluate currently available general-purpose graph foundation models and find that they fail to produce competitive results on our proposed datasets.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of spatial computing communications (SCC), a framework designed to meet the latency and energy demands of multi-user VR over distributed mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. SCC jointly represents the physical space, defined by users and base stations, and the virtual space, representing shared immersive environments, using a probabilistic model of user dynamics and resource requirements. The resource deployment task is then formulated as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem that simultaneously minimizes system latency and energy consumption across distributed MEC resources. To solve this problem, we propose MO-CMPO, a multi-objective consistency model with policy optimization that integrates supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by preference weights. Leveraging a sparse graph neural network (GNN), MO-CMPO efficiently generates Pareto-optimal solutions. Simulations with real-world New Radio base station datasets demonstrate that MO-CMPO achieves superior hypervolume performance and significantly lower inference latency than baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis reveals practical deployment patterns: latency-oriented solutions favor local MEC execution to reduce transmission delay, while energy-oriented solutions minimize redundant placements to save energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submited to IEEE journal</p></details> |

Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights. Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN, a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong performance holds even with limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review in Frontiers in Bioinformatics</p></details> |

Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025), Main Track</p></details> |

This setting captures key characteristics of convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce a maximum-entropy approach to temporal networks and with basic assumptions on constraints, the corresponding network ensembles admit a modular and interpretable representation: a set of global time processes and a static maximum-entropy edge, e.g. node pair, probability. This time-edge labels factorization yields closed-form log-likelihoods, degree, clustering and motif expectations, and yields a whole class of effective generative models. We provide maximum-entropy derivation of an inhomogeneous Poisson edge intensity for temporal networks via functional optimization over path entropy, connecting NHPP modeling to maximum-entropy network ensembles. NHPP consistently improve log-likelihood over generic Poisson processes, while the maximum-entropy edge labels recover strength constraints and reproduce expected unique-degree curves. We discuss the limitations of this framework and how it can be integrated with multivariate Hawkes calibration procedures, renewal theory, and neural kernel estimation in graph neural networks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 25 figures |

Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems, while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced search requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages content. 2 pages references</p></details> |

While methods such as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy, GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3% reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of current state-of-the-art ViGs.

However, training such models on physics data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems. Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining for foundation models.</p></details> |  |

We adopt a task-oriented perspective to systematically review the applications and advancements of multimodal fusion methods and VLMs in the field of robot vision. For semantic scene understanding tasks, we categorize fusion approaches into encoder-decoder frameworks, attention-based architectures, and graph neural networks. Meanwhile, we also analyze the architectural characteristics and practical implementations of these fusion strategies in key tasks such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), 3D object detection, navigation, and manipulation. We compare the evolutionary paths and applicability of VLMs based on large language models (LLMs) with traditional multimodal fusion methods.Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of commonly used datasets, evaluating their applicability and challenges in real-world robotic scenarios. Building on this analysis, we identify key challenges in current research, including cross-modal alignment, efficient fusion, real-time deployment, and domain adaptation. We propose future directions such as self-supervised learning for robust multimodal representations, structured spatial memory and environment modeling to enhance spatial intelligence, and the integration of adversarial robustness and human feedback mechanisms to enable ethically aligned system deployment. Through a comprehensive review, comparative analysis, and forward-looking discussion, we provide a valuable reference for advancing multimodal perception and interaction in robotic vision. A comprehensive list of studies in this survey is available at https://github.com/Xiaofeng-Han-Res/MF-RV.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 11 figures.
