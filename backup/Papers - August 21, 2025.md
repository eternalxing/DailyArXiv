| **[CitySeg: A 3D Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation Foundation Model in City-scale Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09470v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds is a critical technology for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perception systems, enabling the classification of 3D points without relying on any visual information to achieve comprehensive 3D understanding. However, existing models are frequently constrained by the limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual information.</p></details> |  |
| **[SynSeg: Feature Synergy for Multi-Category Contrastive Learning in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06115v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories. Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS). Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance, SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Free Class Purification for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00557v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However, the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS. Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance. However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity. The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP, as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when combined with other OVSS methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[OpenSeg-R: Improving Open-Vocabulary Segmentation via Step-by-Step Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16974v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) has drawn increasing attention for its capacity to generalize segmentation beyond predefined categories. However, existing methods typically predict segmentation masks with simple forward inference, lacking explicit reasoning and interpretability. This makes it challenging for OVS model to distinguish similar categories in open-world settings due to the lack of contextual understanding and discriminative visual cues. To address this limitation, we propose a step-by-step visual reasoning framework for open-vocabulary segmentation, named OpenSeg-R. The proposed OpenSeg-R leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to perform hierarchical visual reasoning before segmentation. Specifically, we generate both generic and image-specific reasoning for each image, forming structured triplets that explain the visual reason for objects in a coarse-to-fine manner. Based on these reasoning steps, we can compose detailed description prompts, and feed them to the segmentor to produce more accurate segmentation masks. To the best of our knowledge, OpenSeg-R is the first framework to introduce explicit step-by-step visual reasoning into OVS. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenSeg-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across five benchmark datasets. Moreover, it achieves consistent gains across all metrics on open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Qualitative results further highlight the effectiveness of our reasoning-guided framework in improving both segmentation precision and interpretability. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Hanzy1996/OpenSeg-R.</p></details> |  |
| **[CorrCLIP: Reconstructing Patch Correlations in CLIP for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10086v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to each pixel without being constrained by a predefined set of categories. While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in zero-shot classification, it struggles to align image patches with category embeddings because of its incoherent patch correlations. This study reveals that inter-class correlations are the main reason for impairing CLIP's segmentation performance. Accordingly, we propose CorrCLIP, which reconstructs the scope and value of patch correlations. Specifically, CorrCLIP leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to define the scope of patch interactions, reducing inter-class correlations. To mitigate the problem that SAM-generated masks may contain patches belonging to different classes, CorrCLIP incorporates self-supervised models to compute coherent similarity values, suppressing the weight of inter-class correlations. Additionally, we introduce two additional branches to strengthen patch features' spatial details and semantic representation. Finally, we update segmentation maps with SAM-generated masks to improve spatial consistency. Based on the improvement across patch correlations, feature representations, and segmentation maps, CorrCLIP achieves superior performance across eight benchmarks. Codes are available at: https://github.com/zdk258/CorrCLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 Oral</p></details> |
| **[FLOSS: Free Lunch in Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10487v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we challenge the conventional practice in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) of using averaged class-wise text embeddings, which are typically obtained by encoding each class name with multiple templates (e.g., a photo of <class>, a sketch of a <class>). We investigate the impact of templates for OVSS, and find that for each class, there exist single-template classifiers--which we refer to as class-experts--that significantly outperform the conventional averaged classifier. First, to identify these class-experts, we introduce a novel approach that estimates them without any labeled data or training. By leveraging the class-wise prediction entropy of single-template classifiers, we select those yielding the lowest entropy as the most reliable class-experts. Second, we combine the outputs of class-experts in a new fusion process. Our plug-and-play method, coined FLOSS, is orthogonal and complementary to existing OVSS methods, offering an improvement without the need for additional labels or training. Extensive experiments show that FLOSS consistently enhances state-of-the-art OVSS models, generalizes well across datasets with different distribution shifts, and delivers substantial improvements in low-data scenarios where only a few unlabeled images are available. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/FLOSS .</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025; Project Page: https://yasserben.github.io/FLOSS/</p></details> |
| **[FA-Seg: A Fast and Accurate Diffusion-Based Method for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23323v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets. Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the computation costs and the quality of the segmentation mask. In this work, we present FA-Seg, a Fast and Accurate training-free framework for open-vocabulary segmentation based on diffusion models. FA-Seg performs segmentation using only a (1+1)-step from a pretrained diffusion model. Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FA-Seg performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the segmentation quality, FA-Seg introduces three key components: (i) a dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction, (ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances semantic precision via multi-resolution attention fusion, and (iii) a Test-Time Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive experiments show that FA-Seg achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our results demonstrate that FA-Seg provides a strong foundation for extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference efficiency. The source code will be open-sourced after this paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized OVSS: Understanding Personal Concept in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11030v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) can segment an image into semantic regions based on arbitrarily given text descriptions even for classes unseen during training, it fails to understand personal texts (e.g., `my mug cup') for segmenting regions of specific interest to users. This paper addresses challenges like recognizing `my mug cup' among `multiple mug cups'. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel task termed \textit{personalized open-vocabulary semantic segmentation} and propose a text prompt tuning-based plug-in method designed to recognize personal visual concepts using a few pairs of images and masks, while maintaining the performance of the original OVSS. Based on the observation that reducing false predictions is essential when applying text prompt tuning to this task, our proposed method employs `negative mask proposal' that captures visual concepts other than the personalized concept. We further improve the performance by enriching the representation of text prompts by injecting visual embeddings of the personal concept into them. This approach enhances personalized OVSS without compromising the original OVSS performance. We demonstrate the superiority of our method on our newly established benchmarks for this task, including FSS$^\text{per}$, CUB$^\text{per}$, and ADE$^\text{per}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025; 15 pages</p></details> |
| **[Beyond-Labels: Advancing Open-Vocabulary Segmentation With Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16769v5)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation attempts to classify and outline objects in an image using arbitrary text labels, including those unseen during training. Self-supervised learning resolves numerous visual and linguistic processing problems when effectively trained. This study investigates simple yet efficient methods for adapting previously learned foundation models for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks. Our research proposes "Beyond-Labels", a lightweight transformer-based fusion module that uses a small amount of image segmentation data to fuse frozen visual representations with language concepts. This strategy allows the model to leverage the extensive knowledge of pre-trained models without requiring significant retraining, making the approach data-efficient and scalable. Furthermore, we capture positional information in images using Fourier embeddings, improving generalization and enabling smooth and consistent spatial encoding. We perform thorough ablation studies to examine the main components of our proposed method. On the standard benchmark PASCAL-5i, the method performs better despite being trained on frozen vision and language representations.

| **[RadZero: Similarity-Based Cross-Attention for Explainable Vision-Language Alignment in Radiology with Zero-Shot Multi-Task Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07416v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multi-modal models have significantly improved vision-language (VL) alignment in radiology. However, existing approaches struggle to effectively utilize complex radiology reports for learning and offer limited interpretability through attention probability visualizations. To address these challenges, we introduce RadZero, a novel framework for VL alignment in radiology with zero-shot multi-task capability. A key component of our approach is VL-CABS (Vision-Language Cross-Attention Based on Similarity), which aligns text embeddings with local image features for interpretable, fine-grained VL reasoning. RadZero leverages large language models to extract concise semantic sentences from radiology reports and employs multi-positive contrastive training to effectively capture relationships between images and multiple relevant textual descriptions. It uses a pre-trained vision encoder with additional trainable Transformer layers, allowing efficient high-resolution image processing. By computing similarity between text embeddings and local image patch features, VL-CABS enables zero-shot inference with similarity probability for classification, and pixel-level VL similarity maps for grounding and segmentation. Experimental results on public chest radiograph benchmarks show that RadZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation. Furthermore, VL similarity map analysis highlights the potential of VL-CABS for improving explainability in VL alignment. Additionally, qualitative evaluation demonstrates RadZero's capability for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness in medical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Image Augmentation for Semantic Segmentation in Outdoor Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00153v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of leaning-based perception algorithms suffer when deployed in out-of-distribution and underrepresented environments. Outdoor robots are particularly susceptible to rapid changes in visual scene appearance due to dynamic lighting, seasonality and weather effects that lead to scenes underrepresented in the training data of the learning-based perception system. In this conceptual paper, we focus on preparing our autonomous vehicle for deployment in snow-filled environments. We propose a novel method for diffusion-based image augmentation to more closely represent the deployment environment in our training data. Diffusion-based image augmentations rely on the public availability of vision foundation models learned on internet-scale datasets. The diffusion-based image augmentations allow us to take control over the semantic distribution of the ground surfaces in the training data and to fine-tune our model for its deployment environment. We employ open vocabulary semantic segmentation models to filter out augmentation candidates that contain hallucinations. We believe that diffusion-based image augmentations can be extended to many other environments apart from snow surfaces, like sandy environments and volcanic terrains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 IEEE ICRA Workshop on Field Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing the Multi-View Fusion Potential: Noise Correction in VLM for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22817v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding approaches mainly focus on training 3D networks through contrastive learning with point-text pairs or by distilling 2D features into 3D models via point-pixel alignment. While these methods show considerable performance in benchmarks with limited vocabularies, they struggle to handle diverse object categories as the limited amount of 3D data upbound training strong open-vocabulary 3d models. We observe that 2D multi-view fusion methods take precedence in understanding diverse concepts in 3D scenes. However, inherent noises in vision-language models lead multi-view fusion to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we introduce MVOV3D, a novel approach aimed at unleashing the potential of 2D multi-view fusion for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. We focus on reducing the inherent noises without training, thereby preserving the generalizability while enhancing open-world capabilities. Specifically, MVOV3D improves multi-view 2D features by leveraging precise region-level image features and text features encoded by CLIP encoders and incorporates 3D geometric priors to optimize multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, our MVOV3D achieves a new record with 14.7% mIoU on ScanNet200 and 16.2% mIoU on Matterport160 for challenge open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, outperforming current leading trained 3D networks by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReME: A Data-Centric Framework for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21233v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets. In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing OVS without training.

| **[LPOSS: Label Propagation Over Patches and Pixels for Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19777v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a training-free method for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation using Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs). Our approach enhances the initial per-patch predictions of VLMs through label propagation, which jointly optimizes predictions by incorporating patch-to-patch relationships. Since VLMs are primarily optimized for cross-modal alignment and not for intra-modal similarity, we use a Vision Model (VM) that is observed to better capture these relationships. We address resolution limitations inherent to patch-based encoders by applying label propagation at the pixel level as a refinement step, significantly improving segmentation accuracy near class boundaries. Our method, called LPOSS+, performs inference over the entire image, avoiding window-based processing and thereby capturing contextual interactions across the full image. LPOSS+ achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free methods, across a diverse set of datasets. Code: https://github.com/vladan-stojnic/LPOSS</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Depth and Language for Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09881v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) and domain generalization in semantic segmentation (DGSS) highlight a subtle complementarity that motivates Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (OV-DGSS). OV-DGSS aims to generate pixel-level masks for unseen categories while maintaining robustness across unseen domains, a critical capability for real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We introduce Vireo, a novel single-stage framework for OV-DGSS that unifies the strengths of OVSS and DGSS for the first time. Vireo builds upon the frozen Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) and incorporates scene geometry via Depth VFMs to extract domain-invariant structural features. To bridge the gap between visual and textual modalities under domain shift, we propose three key components: (1) GeoText Prompts, which align geometric features with language cues and progressively refine VFM encoder representations; (2) Coarse Mask Prior Embedding (CMPE) for enhancing gradient flow for faster convergence and stronger textual influence; and (3) the Domain-Open-Vocabulary Vector Embedding Head (DOV-VEH), which fuses refined structural and semantic features for robust prediction. Comprehensive evaluation on these components demonstrates the effectiveness of our designs. Our proposed Vireo achieves the state-of-the-art performance and surpasses existing methods by a large margin in both domain generalization and open-vocabulary recognition, offering a unified and scalable solution for robust visual understanding in diverse and dynamic environments. Code is available at https://github.com/anonymouse-9c53tp182bvz/Vireo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-time Contrastive Concepts for Open-world Semantic Segmentation with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05061v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent CLIP-like Vision-Language Models (VLMs), pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs to align both modalities with a simple contrastive objective, have paved the way to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Given an arbitrary set of textual queries, image pixels are assigned the closest query in feature space. However, this works well when a user exhaustively lists all possible visual concepts in an image that contrast against each other for the assignment. This corresponds to the current evaluation setup in the literature, which relies on having access to a list of in-domain relevant concepts, typically classes of a benchmark dataset. Here, we consider the more challenging (and realistic) scenario of segmenting a single concept, given a textual prompt and nothing else. To achieve good results, besides contrasting with the generic 'background' text, we propose two different approaches to automatically generate, at test time, query-specific textual contrastive concepts. We do so by leveraging the distribution of text in the VLM's training set or crafted LLM prompts. We also propose a metric designed to evaluate this scenario and show the relevance of our approach on commonly used datasets.</p></details> | TMLR camera-ready |

However, they encounter significant challenges in cross-domain generalization, hindering their practical efficacy in real-world applications. Embodied AI systems are transforming autonomous navigation for ground vehicles and drones by enhancing their perception abilities, and in this study, we present AetherVision-Bench, a benchmark for multi-angle segmentation across aerial, and ground perspectives, which facilitates an extensive evaluation of performance across different viewing angles and sensor modalities. We assess state-of-the-art OVSS models on the proposed benchmark and investigate the key factors that impact the performance of zero-shot transfer models. Our work pioneers the creation of a robustness benchmark, offering valuable insights and establishing a foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Workshop on Foundation Models Meet Embodied Agents at CVPR 2025 (Non-archival Track)</p></details> |
| **[OV-COAST: Cost Aggregation with Optimal Transport for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03706v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) entails assigning semantic labels to each pixel in an image using textual descriptions, typically leveraging world models such as CLIP. To enhance out-of-domain generalization, we propose Cost Aggregation with Optimal Transport (OV-COAST) for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To align visual-language features within the framework of optimal transport theory, we employ cost volume to construct a cost matrix, which quantifies the distance between two distributions. Our approach adopts a two-stage optimization strategy: in the first stage, the optimal transport problem is solved using cost volume via Sinkhorn distance to obtain an alignment solution; in the second stage, this solution is used to guide the training of the CAT-Seg model. We evaluate state-of-the-art OVSS models on the MESS benchmark, where our approach notably improves the performance of the cost-aggregation model CAT-Seg with ViT-B backbone, achieving superior results, surpassing CAT-Seg by 1.72 % and SAN-B by 4.9 % mIoU.

| **[A Survey on Training-free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22209v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is one of the most fundamental tasks in image understanding with a long history of research, and subsequently a myriad of different approaches. Traditional methods strive to train models up from scratch, requiring vast amounts of computational resources and training data. In the advent of moving to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which asks models to classify beyond learned categories, large quantities of finely annotated data would be prohibitively expensive. Researchers have instead turned to training-free methods where they leverage existing models made for tasks where data is more easily acquired. Specifically, this survey will cover the history, nuance, idea development and the state-of-the-art in training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation that leverages existing multi-modal classification models. We will first give a preliminary on the task definition followed by an overview of popular model archetypes and then spotlight over 30 approaches split into broader research branches: purely CLIP-based, those leveraging auxiliary visual foundation models and ones relying on generative methods. Subsequently, we will discuss the limitations and potential problems of current research, as well as provide some underexplored ideas for future study. We believe this survey will serve as a good onboarding read to new researchers and spark increased interest in the area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21844v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, test-time adaptation has attracted wide interest in the context of vision-language models for image classification. However, to the best of our knowledge, the problem is completely overlooked in dense prediction tasks such as Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS). In response, we propose a novel TTA method tailored to adapting VLMs for segmentation during test time. Unlike TTA methods for image classification, our Multi-Level and Multi-Prompt (MLMP) entropy minimization integrates features from intermediate vision-encoder layers and is performed with different text-prompt templates at both the global CLS token and local pixel-wise levels. Our approach could be used as plug-and-play for any segmentation network, does not require additional training data or labels, and remains effective even with a single test sample. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive OVSS TTA benchmark suite, which integrates a rigorous evaluation protocol, seven segmentation datasets, and 15 common corruptions, with a total of 82 distinct test scenarios, establishing a standardized and comprehensive testbed for future TTA research in open-vocabulary segmentation. Our experiments on this suite demonstrate that our segmentation-tailored method consistently delivers significant gains over direct adoption of TTA classification baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPSeg: Dual-Prompt Cost Volume Learning for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11676v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to segment images into distinct semantic regions for both seen and unseen categories at the pixel level. Current methods utilize text embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP but struggle with the inherent domain gap between image and text embeddings, even after extensive alignment during training. Additionally, relying solely on deep text-aligned features limits shallow-level feature guidance, which is crucial for detecting small objects and fine details, ultimately reducing segmentation accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a dual prompting framework, DPSeg, for this task. Our approach combines dual-prompt cost volume generation, a cost volume-guided decoder, and a semantic-guided prompt refinement strategy that leverages our dual prompting scheme to mitigate alignment issues in visual prompt generation. By incorporating visual embeddings from a visual prompt encoder, our approach reduces the domain gap between text and image embeddings while providing multi-level guidance through shallow features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on multiple public datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[3D Vision-Language Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07577v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models have propelled the development of multi-modal 3D scene understanding, which has vital applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual/augmented reality. However, current multi-modal scene understanding approaches have naively embedded semantic representations into 3D reconstruction methods without striking a balance between visual and language modalities, which leads to unsatisfying semantic rasterization of translucent or reflective objects, as well as over-fitting on color modality. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a solution that adequately handles the distinct visual and semantic modalities, i.e., a 3D vision-language Gaussian splatting model for scene understanding, to put emphasis on the representation learning of language modality. We propose a novel cross-modal rasterizer, using modality fusion along with a smoothed semantic indicator for enhancing semantic rasterization. We also employ a camera-view blending technique to improve semantic consistency between existing and synthesized views, thereby effectively mitigating over-fitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

| **[ITACLIP: Boosting Training-Free Semantic Segmentation with Image, Text, and Architectural Enhancements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12044v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in foundational Vision Language Models (VLMs) have reshaped the evaluation paradigm in computer vision tasks. These foundational models, especially CLIP, have accelerated research in open-vocabulary computer vision tasks, including Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS). Although the initial results are promising, the dense prediction capabilities of VLMs still require further improvement. In this study, we enhance the semantic segmentation performance of CLIP by introducing new modules and modifications: 1) architectural changes in the last layer of ViT and the incorporation of attention maps from the middle layers with the last layer, 2) Image Engineering: applying data augmentations to enrich input image representations, and 3) using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate definitions and synonyms for each class name to leverage CLIP's open-vocabulary capabilities.

| **[econSG: Efficient and Multi-view Consistent Open-Vocabulary 3D Semantic Gaussians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06003v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary focus of most recent works on open-vocabulary neural fields is extracting precise semantic features from the VLMs and then consolidating them efficiently into a multi-view consistent 3D neural fields representation. However, most existing works over-trusted SAM to regularize image-level CLIP without any further refinement. Moreover, several existing works improved efficiency by dimensionality reduction of semantic features from 2D VLMs before fusing with 3DGS semantic fields, which inevitably leads to multi-view inconsistency. In this work, we propose econSG for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with 3DGS. Our econSG consists of: 1) A Confidence-region Guided Regularization (CRR) that mutually refines SAM and CLIP to get the best of both worlds for precise semantic features with complete and precise boundaries. 2) A low dimensional contextual space to enforce 3D multi-view consistency while improving computational efficiency by fusing backprojected multi-view 2D features and follow by dimensional reduction directly on the fused 3D features instead of operating on each 2D view separately. Our econSG shows state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets compared to the existing methods. Furthermore, we are also the most efficient training among all the methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling Spectral Graph for Object-Context Aware Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17150v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) has advanced with recent vision-language models (VLMs), enabling segmentation beyond predefined categories through various learning schemes. Notably, training-free methods offer scalable, easily deployable solutions for handling unseen data, a key goal of OVSS. Yet, a critical issue persists: lack of object-level context consideration when segmenting complex objects in the challenging environment of OVSS based on arbitrary query prompts. This oversight limits models' ability to group semantically consistent elements within object and map them precisely to user-defined arbitrary classes. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that overcomes this limitation by incorporating object-level contextual knowledge within images. Specifically, our model enhances intra-object consistency by distilling spectral-driven features from vision foundation models into the attention mechanism of the visual encoder, enabling semantically coherent components to form a single object mask. Additionally, we refine the text embeddings with zero-shot object presence likelihood to ensure accurate alignment with the specific objects represented in the images. By leveraging object-level contextual knowledge, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalizability across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods address this by sequentially connecting a powerful mask proposal generator, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP. But these two-stage approaches often suffer from high computational costs, memory inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose ESC-Net, a novel one-stage open-vocabulary segmentation model that leverages the SAM decoder blocks for class-agnostic segmentation within an efficient inference framework. By embedding pseudo prompts generated from image-text correlations into SAM's promptable segmentation framework, ESC-Net achieves refined spatial aggregation for accurate mask predictions. ESC-Net achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks, including ADE20K, PASCAL-VOC, and PASCAL-Context, outperforming prior methods in both efficiency and accuracy.

Autonomous assistive robots, such as smart wheelchairs, require robust capabilities in spatial segmentation and semantic recognition to navigate complex built environments effectively. Place segmentation involves delineating spatial regions like rooms or functional areas, while semantic recognition assigns semantic labels to these regions, enabling accurate localization to user-specific needs. Existing approaches often utilize deep learning; however, these close-vocabulary detection systems struggle to interpret intuitive and casual human instructions. Additionally, most existing methods ignore the uncertainty of the scene recognition problem, leading to low success rates, particularly in ambiguous and complex environments. To address these challenges, we propose an open-vocabulary scene semantic segmentation and detection pipeline leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach follows a 'Segment Detect Select' framework for open-vocabulary scene classification, enabling adaptive and intuitive navigation for assistive robots in built environments.</p></details> | 32 pages, 7 figures |

However, large shifts between training and test domains degrade their performance, requiring fine-tuning for effective real-world applications. We introduce Semantic Library Adaptation (SemLA), a novel framework for training-free, test-time domain adaptation. SemLA leverages a library of LoRA-based adapters indexed with CLIP embeddings, dynamically merging the most relevant adapters based on proximity to the target domain in the embedding space. This approach constructs an ad-hoc model tailored to each specific input without additional training. Our method scales efficiently, enhances explainability by tracking adapter contributions, and inherently protects data privacy, making it ideal for sensitive applications. Comprehensive experiments on a 20-domain benchmark built over 10 standard datasets demonstrate SemLA's superior adaptability and performance across diverse settings, establishing a new standard in domain adaptation for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Rethinking the Global Knowledge of CLIP in Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06818v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works modify CLIP to perform open-vocabulary semantic segmentation in a training-free manner (TF-OVSS). In vanilla CLIP, patch-wise image representations mainly encode homogeneous image-level properties, which hinders the application of CLIP to the dense prediction task. Previous TF-OVSS works sacrifice globality to enhance the locality of CLIP features, by making each patch mainly attend to itself or its neighboring patches within a narrow local window. With their modifications,the ability of CLIP to aggregate global context information is largely weakened. Differently, in this paper, we rethink the global knowledge encoded by CLIP and propose GCLIP to answer how to extract and utilize beneficial global knowledge of CLIP for TF-OVSS. As the representation of each patch is finally determined by the attention weights and the Value embeddings, we propose to reshape the last-block attention and Value embeddings to aggregate useful global context into final features. Firstly, we aim to equip the last-block attention with image-level properties while not introducing homogeneous attention patterns across patches. To realize the goal, we fuse the attention from the global-token emerging blocks with the Query-Query attention. Secondly, we aim to make Value embeddings of the last-block attention module more semantically correlated. To realize this, we design a novel channel suppression strategy.Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Test-Time Optimization for Domain Adaptive Open Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04696v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Seg-TTO, a novel framework for zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS), designed to excel in specialized domain tasks. While current open-vocabulary approaches show impressive performance on standard segmentation benchmarks under zero-shot settings, they fall short of supervised counterparts on highly domain-specific datasets. We focus on segmentation-specific test-time optimization to address this gap. Segmentation requires an understanding of multiple concepts within a single image while retaining the locality and spatial structure of representations. We propose a novel self-supervised objective adhering to these requirements and use it to align the model parameters with input images at test time. In the textual modality, we learn multiple embeddings for each category to capture diverse concepts within an image, while in the visual modality, we calculate pixel-level losses followed by embedding aggregation operations specific to preserving spatial structure. Our resulting framework termed Seg-TTO is a plug-and-play module. We integrate Seg-TTO with three state-of-the-art OVSS approaches and evaluate across 22 challenging OVSS tasks covering a range of specialized domains. Our Seg-TTO demonstrates clear performance improvements (up to 27% mIoU increase on some datasets) establishing new state-of-the-art. Our code and models will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |

While this flexibility represents a significant advancement, current approaches still rely on manually specified class names as input, creating an inherent bottleneck in real-world applications. This work proposes a Vocabulary-Free Semantic Segmentation pipeline, eliminating the need for predefined class vocabularies. Specifically, we address the chicken-and-egg problem where users need knowledge of all potential objects within a scene to identify them, yet the purpose of segmentation is often to discover these objects. The proposed approach leverages Vision-Language Models to automatically recognize objects and generate appropriate class names, aiming to solve the challenge of class specification and naming quality. Through extensive experiments on several public datasets, we highlight the crucial role of the text encoder in model performance, particularly when the image text classes are paired with generated descriptions. Despite the challenges introduced by the sensitivity of the segmentation text encoder to false negatives within the class tagging process, which adds complexity to the task, we demonstrate that our fully automated pipeline significantly enhances vocabulary-free segmentation accuracy across diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to: Pattern Recognition Letters, Klara Reichard and Giulia Rizzoli equally contributed to this work</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Redundancy Reduction for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17642v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is an open-world task that aims to assign each pixel within an image to a specific class defined by arbitrary text descriptions. Recent advancements in large-scale vision-language models have demonstrated their open-vocabulary understanding capabilities, significantly facilitating the development of OVSS. However, most existing methods suffer from either suboptimal performance or long latency. This study introduces ERR-Seg, a novel framework that effectively reduces redundancy to balance accuracy and efficiency. ERR-Seg incorporates a training-free Channel Reduction Module (CRM) that leverages prior knowledge from vision-language models like CLIP to identify the most relevant classes while discarding others. Moreover, it incorporates Efficient Semantic Context Fusion (ESCF) with spatial-level and class-level sequence reduction strategies. CRM and ESCF result in substantial memory and computational savings without compromising accuracy. Additionally, recognizing the significance of hierarchical semantics extracted from middle-layer features for closed-set semantic segmentation, ERR-Seg introduces the Hierarchical Semantic Module (HSM) to exploit hierarchical semantics in the context of OVSS. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods under the ADE20K-847 setting, ERR-Seg achieves +$5.6\%$ mIoU improvement and reduces latency by $67.3\%$.</p></details> |  |
| **[InvSeg: Test-Time Prompt Inversion for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11473v2)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-textual correlations in the attention maps derived from text-to-image diffusion models are proven beneficial to dense visual prediction tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation. However, a significant challenge arises due to the input distributional discrepancy between the context-rich sentences used for image generation and the isolated class names typically used in semantic segmentation. This discrepancy hinders diffusion models from capturing accurate visual-textual correlations. To solve this, we propose InvSeg, a test-time prompt inversion method that tackles open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by inverting image-specific visual context into text prompt embedding space, leveraging structure information derived from the diffusion model's reconstruction process to enrich text prompts so as to associate each class with a structure-consistent mask. Specifically, we introduce Contrastive Soft Clustering (CSC) to align derived masks with the image's structure information, softly selecting anchors for each class and calculating weighted distances to push inner-class pixels closer while separating inter-class pixels, thereby ensuring mask distinction and internal consistency. By incorporating sample-specific context, InvSeg learns context-rich text prompts in embedding space and achieves accurate semantic alignment across modalities. Experiments show that InvSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context and COCO Object datasets.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[FGAseg: Fine-Grained Pixel-Text Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00877v2)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary segmentation aims to identify and segment specific regions and objects based on text-based descriptions. A common solution is to leverage powerful vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to bridge the gap between vision and text information. However, VLMs are typically pretrained for image-level vision-text alignment, focusing on global semantic features. In contrast, segmentation tasks require fine-grained pixel-level alignment and detailed category boundary information, which VLMs alone cannot provide. As a result, information extracted directly from VLMs can't meet the requirements of segmentation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose FGAseg, a model designed for fine-grained pixel-text alignment and category boundary supplementation. The core of FGAseg is a Pixel-Level Alignment module that employs a cross-modal attention mechanism and a text-pixel alignment loss to refine the coarse-grained alignment from CLIP, achieving finer-grained pixel-text semantic alignment. Additionally, to enrich category boundary information, we introduce the alignment matrices as optimizable pseudo-masks during forward propagation and propose Category Information Supplementation module. These pseudo-masks, derived from cosine and convolutional similarity, provide essential global and local boundary information between different categories. By combining these two strategies, FGAseg effectively enhances pixel-level alignment and category boundary information, addressing key challenges in open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FGAseg outperforms existing methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[OVGaussian: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Segmentation with Open Vocabularies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00326v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary scene understanding using 3D Gaussian (3DGS) representations has garnered considerable attention. However, existing methods mostly lift knowledge from large 2D vision models into 3DGS on a scene-by-scene basis, restricting the capabilities of open-vocabulary querying within their training scenes so that lacking the generalizability to novel scenes. In this work, we propose \textbf{OVGaussian}, a generalizable \textbf{O}pen-\textbf{V}ocabulary 3D semantic segmentation framework based on the 3D \textbf{Gaussian} representation. We first construct a large-scale 3D scene dataset based on 3DGS, dubbed \textbf{SegGaussian}, which provides detailed semantic and instance annotations for both Gaussian points and multi-view images. To promote semantic generalization across scenes, we introduce Generalizable Semantic Rasterization (GSR), which leverages a 3D neural network to learn and predict the semantic property for each 3D Gaussian point, where the semantic property can be rendered as multi-view consistent 2D semantic maps. In the next, we propose a Cross-modal Consistency Learning (CCL) framework that utilizes open-vocabulary annotations of 2D images and 3D Gaussians within SegGaussian to train the 3D neural network capable of open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across Gaussian-based 3D scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that OVGaussian significantly outperforms baseline methods, exhibiting robust cross-scene, cross-domain, and novel-view generalization capabilities. Code and the SegGaussian dataset will be released. (https://github.com/runnanchen/OVGaussian).</p></details> |  |

However, unlike vision-language models such as CLIP, self-supervised visual features are not readily aligned with language, hindering their adoption in open-vocabulary tasks. Our method, named dino.txt, unlocks this new ability for DINOv2, a widely used self-supervised visual encoder. We build upon the LiT training strategy, which trains a text encoder to align with a frozen vision model but leads to unsatisfactory results on dense tasks. We propose several key ingredients to improve performance on both global and dense tasks, such as concatenating the [CLS] token with the patch average to train the alignment and curating data using both text and image modalities. With these, we successfully train a CLIP-like model with only a fraction of the computational cost compared to CLIP while achieving state-of-the-art results in zero-shot classification and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Feature Pyramid Tokenization and Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14145v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The visual understanding are often approached from 3 granular levels: image, patch and pixel. Visual Tokenization, trained by self-supervised reconstructive learning, compresses visual data by codebook in patch-level with marginal information loss, but the visual tokens does not have semantic meaning. Open Vocabulary semantic segmentation benefits from the evolving Vision-Language models (VLMs) with strong image zero-shot capability, but transferring image-level to pixel-level understanding remains an imminent challenge. In this paper, we treat segmentation as tokenizing pixels and study a united perceptual and semantic token compression for all granular understanding and consequently facilitate open vocabulary semantic segmentation. Referring to the cognitive process of pretrained VLM where the low-level features are progressively composed to high-level semantics, we propose Feature Pyramid Tokenization (PAT) to cluster and represent multi-resolution feature by learnable codebooks and then decode them by joint learning pixel reconstruction and semantic segmentation. We design loosely coupled pixel and semantic learning branches. The pixel branch simulates bottom-up composition and top-down visualization of codebook tokens, while the semantic branch collectively fuse hierarchical codebooks as auxiliary segmentation guidance. Our experiments show that PAT enhances the semantic intuition of VLM feature pyramid, improves performance over the baseline segmentation model and achieves competitive performance on open vocabulary semantic segmentation benchmark. Our model is parameter-efficient for VLM integration and flexible for the independent tokenization. We hope to give inspiration not only on improving segmentation but also on semantic visual token utilization.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

To address this, researchers have explored two independent approaches: adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and leveraging synthetic data. However, VLMs often struggle with granularity, failing to disentangle fine-grained concepts, while synthetic data-based methods remain limited by the scope of available datasets. This paper proposes enhancing segmentation accuracy across diverse domains by integrating Vision-Language reasoning with key strategies for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). First, we improve the fine-grained segmentation capabilities of VLMs through multi-scale contextual data, robust text embeddings with prompt augmentation, and layer-wise fine-tuning in our proposed Foundational-Retaining Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (FROVSS) framework. Next, we incorporate these enhancements into a UDA framework by employing distillation to stabilize training and cross-domain mixed sampling to boost adaptability without compromising generalization. The resulting UDA-FROVSS framework is the first UDA approach to effectively adapt across domains without requiring shared categories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Vision-Text Representation Optimizing for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00744v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models, e.g. CLIP, have been increasingly used to address the challenging Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) task, benefiting from their well-aligned vision-text embedding space. Typical solutions involve either freezing CLIP during training to unilaterally maintain its zero-shot capability, or fine-tuning CLIP vision encoder to achieve perceptual sensitivity to local regions. However, few of them incorporate vision-text collaborative optimization. Based on this, we propose the Content-Dependent Transfer to adaptively enhance each text embedding by interacting with the input image, which presents a parameter-efficient way to optimize the text representation. Besides, we additionally introduce a Representation Compensation strategy, reviewing the original CLIP-V representation as compensation to maintain the zero-shot capability of CLIP. In this way, the vision and text representation of CLIP are optimized collaboratively, enhancing the alignment of the vision-text feature space. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to establish the collaborative vision-text optimizing mechanism within the OVS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior performance on popular OVS benchmarks. In open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches by +0.5, +2.3, +3.4, +0.4 and +1.1 mIoU, respectively on A-847, A-150, PC-459, PC-59 and PAS-20.

Recent studies have expanded their applications in autonomous reconstruction through task assignment methods. However, these methods are mainly limited to single robot, and rapid reconstruction of large-scale scenes remains challenging. Additionally, task-driven planning based on surface uncertainty is prone to being trapped in local optima. To this end, we propose the first 3DGS-based centralized multi-robot autonomous 3D reconstruction framework. To further reduce time cost of task generation and improve reconstruction quality, we integrate online open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with surface uncertainty of 3DGS, focusing view sampling on regions with high instance uncertainty. Finally, we develop a multi-robot collaboration strategy with mode and task assignments improving reconstruction quality while ensuring planning efficiency. Our method demonstrates the highest reconstruction quality among all planning methods and superior planning efficiency compared to existing multi-robot methods. We deploy our method on multiple robots, and results show that it can effectively plan view paths and reconstruct scenes with high quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMSeg: Unleashing the Power of Large-Scale Models for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00364v1)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is widely agreed that open-vocabulary-based approaches outperform classical closed-set training solutions for recognizing unseen objects in images for semantic segmentation. Existing open-vocabulary approaches leverage vision-language models, such as CLIP, to align visual features with rich semantic features acquired through pre-training on large-scale vision-language datasets. However, the text prompts employed in these methods are short phrases based on fixed templates, failing to capture comprehensive object attributes. Moreover, while the CLIP model excels at exploiting image-level features, it is less effective at pixel-level representation, which is crucial for semantic segmentation tasks. In this work, we propose to alleviate the above-mentioned issues by leveraging multiple large-scale models to enhance the alignment between fine-grained visual features and enriched linguistic features. Specifically, our method employs large language models (LLMs) to generate enriched language prompts with diverse visual attributes for each category, including color, shape/size, and texture/material. Additionally, for enhanced visual feature extraction, the SAM model is adopted as a supplement to the CLIP visual encoder through a proposed learnable weighted fusion strategy. Built upon these techniques, our method, termed LMSeg, achieves state-of-the-art performance across all major open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks. The code will be made available soon.</p></details> |  |

Vision-language foundation models, especially CLIP, have recently emerged as powerful tools for acquiring open-vocabulary capabilities. However, fine-tuning CLIP to equip it with pixel-level prediction ability often suffers three issues: 1) high computational cost, 2) misalignment between the two inherent modalities of CLIP, and 3) degraded generalization ability on unseen categories. To address these issues, we propose H-CLIP a symmetrical parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy conducted in hyperspherical space for both of the two CLIP modalities. Specifically, the PEFT strategy is achieved by a series of efficient block-diagonal learnable transformation matrices and a dual cross-relation communication module among all learnable matrices. Since the PEFT strategy is conducted symmetrically to the two CLIP modalities, the misalignment between them is mitigated. Furthermore, we apply an additional constraint to PEFT on the CLIP text encoder according to the hyperspherical energy principle, i.e., minimizing hyperspherical energy during fine-tuning preserves the intrinsic structure of the original parameter space, to prevent the destruction of the generalization ability offered by the CLIP text encoder. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks show that H-CLIP achieves new SOTA open-vocabulary semantic segmentation results while only requiring updating approximately 4% of the total parameters of CLIP.</p></details> |  |

The key is to improve spatial representation of image-level CLIP, such as replacing self-attention map at last layer with self-self attention map or vision foundation model based attention map. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical framework, named CLIPer, that hierarchically improves spatial representation of CLIP. The proposed CLIPer includes an early-layer fusion module and a fine-grained compensation module. We observe that, the embeddings and attention maps at early layers can preserve spatial structural information. Inspired by this, we design the early-layer fusion module to generate segmentation map with better spatial coherence. Afterwards, we employ a fine-grained compensation module to compensate the local details using the self-attention maps of diffusion model. We conduct the experiments on seven segmentation datasets. Our proposed CLIPer achieves the state-of-the-art performance on these datasets. For instance, using ViT-L, CLIPer has the mIoU of 69.8% and 43.3% on VOC and COCO Object, outperforming ProxyCLIP by 9.2% and 4.1% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepange and code: https://linsun449.github.io/cliper</p></details> |

Nevertheless, traditional techniques such as global feature alignment or vision-language model distillation tend to impose only approximate correspondence, struggling notably with delineating fine-grained segmentation boundaries. To address this gap, we propose a more meticulous mask-level alignment between 3D features and the 2D-text embedding space through a cross-modal mask reasoning framework, XMask3D. In our approach, we developed a mask generator based on the denoising UNet from a pre-trained diffusion model, leveraging its capability for precise textual control over dense pixel representations and enhancing the open-world adaptability of the generated masks. We further integrate 3D global features as implicit conditions into the pre-trained 2D denoising UNet, enabling the generation of segmentation masks with additional 3D geometry awareness. Subsequently, the generated 2D masks are employed to align mask-level 3D representations with the vision-language feature space, thereby augmenting the open vocabulary capability of 3D geometry embeddings. Finally, we fuse complementary 2D and 3D mask features, resulting in competitive performance across multiple benchmarks for 3D open vocabulary semantic segmentation.

Pixel-level interpretation is a critical aspect of remote sensing image applications; however, a prevalent limitation remains the need for extensive manual annotation. For this, we try to introduce open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) into the remote sensing context. However, due to the sensitivity of remote sensing images to low-resolution features, distorted target shapes and ill-fitting boundaries are exhibited in the prediction mask. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple and general upsampler, SimFeatUp, to restore lost spatial information in deep features in a training-free style. Further, based on the observation of the abnormal response of local patch tokens to [CLS] token in CLIP, we propose to execute a straightforward subtraction operation to alleviate the global bias in patch tokens. Extensive experiments are conducted on 17 remote sensing datasets spanning semantic segmentation, building extraction, road detection, and flood detection tasks. Our method achieves an average of 5.8%, 8.2%, 4.0%, and 15.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods on 4 tasks.

Meanwhile, the recent Open-vocabulary Semantic Scene understanding based on large-scale vision language models is effective in open-set settings because it can learn diverse concepts and categories. However, these prior methods fail to generalize across different camera views due to the lack of cross-view geometric modeling. At present, there are limited studies analyzing cross-view learning. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Unsupervised Cross-view Adaptation Learning approach to modeling the geometric structural change across views in Semantic Scene Understanding. First, we introduce a novel Cross-view Geometric Constraint on Unpaired Data to model structural changes in images and segmentation masks across cameras.

Traditional RGB-T semantic segmentation models often struggle to generalize across diverse scenarios due to their reliance on pretrained models and predefined categories. Recent advancements in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have facilitated a shift from closed-set to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods. However, these models face challenges in dealing with intricate scenes, primarily due to the heterogeneity between RGB and thermal modalities. To address this gap, we present Open-RGBT, a novel open-vocabulary RGB-T semantic segmentation model. Specifically, we obtain instance-level detection proposals by incorporating visual prompts to enhance category understanding. Additionally, we employ the CLIP model to assess image-text similarity, which helps correct semantic consistency and mitigates ambiguities in category identification. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Open-RGBT achieves superior performance in diverse and challenging real-world scenarios, even in the wild, significantly advancing the field of RGB-T semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, unlike previous research that ignores the ``noise'' raised during feature projection from 2D to 3D, we propose a novel distillation learning framework named CUS3D. In our approach, an object-level denosing projection module is designed to screen out the ``noise'' and ensure more accurate 3D feature. Based on the obtained features, a multimodal distillation learning module is designed to align the 3D feature with CLIP semantic feature space with object-centered constrains to achieve advanced unsupervised semantic segmentation. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both unsupervised and open-vocabulary segmentation, and the results consistently showcase the superiority of our model in achieving advanced unsupervised segmentation results and its effectiveness in open-vocabulary segmentation.</p></details> | 6 pages,3 figures |

Meanwhile, vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, have showcased remarkable effectiveness in numerous zero-shot image-level tasks, owing to their robust generalizability. Recently, a body of work has investigated utilizing these models in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However, existing approaches often rely on impractical supervised pre-training or access to additional pre-trained networks. In this work, we propose a strong baseline for training-free OVSS, termed Neighbour-Aware CLIP (NACLIP), representing a straightforward adaptation of CLIP tailored for this scenario. Our method enforces localization of patches in the self-attention of CLIP's vision transformer which, despite being crucial for dense prediction tasks, has been overlooked in the OVSS literature. By incorporating design choices favouring segmentation, our approach significantly improves performance without requiring additional data, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or extensive hyperparameter tuning, making it highly practical for real-world applications.

However, existing approaches utilizing CLIP's text and patch embeddings to generate semantic masks often misidentify input pixels from unseen classes, leading to confusion between novel classes and semantically similar ones. In this work, we propose a novel approach, TagCLIP (Trusty-aware guided CLIP), to address this issue. We disentangle the ill-posed optimization problem into two parallel processes: semantic matching performed individually and reliability judgment for improving discrimination ability. Building on the idea of special tokens in language modeling representing sentence-level embeddings, we introduce a trusty token that enables distinguishing novel classes from known ones in prediction. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012, COCO-Stuff 164K and PASCAL Context. Our results show that TagCLIP improves the Intersection over Union (IoU) of unseen classes by 7.4%, 1.7% and 2.1%, respectively, with negligible overheads.

However, challenges arise due to limited event-based data and the absence of large-scale segmentation benchmarks. Current works are confined to closed-set semantic segmentation, limiting their adaptability to other applications. In this paper, we introduce OVOSE, the first Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation algorithm for Event cameras. OVOSE leverages synthetic event data and knowledge distillation from a pre-trained image-based foundation model to an event-based counterpart, effectively preserving spatial context and transferring open-vocabulary semantic segmentation capabilities. We evaluate the performance of OVOSE on two driving semantic segmentation datasets DDD17, and DSEC-Semantic, comparing it with existing conventional image open-vocabulary models adapted for event-based data. Similarly, we compare OVOSE with state-of-the-art methods designed for closed-set settings in unsupervised domain adaptation for event-based semantic segmentation. OVOSE demonstrates superior performance, showcasing its potential for real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/ram95d/OVOSE.</p></details> | conference |

Plenty of the previous art casts this task as pixel-to-text classification without object-level comprehension, leveraging the image-to-text classification capability of pretrained vision-and-language models. We argue that visual objects are distinguishable without the prior text information as segmentation is essentially a vision task. Lazy visual grounding first discovers object masks covering an image with iterative Normalized cuts and then later assigns text on the discovered objects in a late interaction manner. Our model requires no additional training yet shows great performance on five public datasets: Pascal VOC, Pascal Context, COCO-object, COCO-stuff, and ADE 20K.

While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models shine in recognizing visual concepts from text, they often struggle with segment coherence due to their limited localization ability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) excel at acquiring spatially consistent local visual representations, yet they fall short in semantic understanding. This paper introduces ProxyCLIP, an innovative framework designed to harmonize the strengths of both CLIP and VFMs, facilitating enhanced open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. ProxyCLIP leverages the spatial feature correspondence from VFMs as a form of proxy attention to augment CLIP, thereby inheriting the VFMs' robust local consistency and maintaining CLIP's exceptional zero-shot transfer capacity. We propose an adaptive normalization and masking strategy to get the proxy attention from VFMs, allowing for adaptation across different VFMs. Remarkably, as a training-free approach, ProxyCLIP significantly improves the average mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) across eight benchmarks from 40.3 to 44.4, showcasing its exceptional efficacy in bridging the gap between spatial precision and semantic richness for the open-vocabulary segmentation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

In this work, we propose a model, called SegPoint, that leverages the reasoning capabilities of a multi-modal Large Language Model (LLM) to produce point-wise segmentation masks across a diverse range of tasks: 1) 3D instruction segmentation, 2) 3D referring segmentation, 3) 3D semantic segmentation, and 4) 3D open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To advance 3D instruction research, we introduce a new benchmark, Instruct3D, designed to evaluate segmentation performance from complex and implicit instructional texts, featuring 2,565 point cloud-instruction pairs. Our experimental results demonstrate that SegPoint achieves competitive performance on established benchmarks such as ScanRefer for referring segmentation and ScanNet for semantic segmentation, while delivering outstanding outcomes on the Instruct3D dataset.

In this paper, we carefully re-investigate the architecture of CLIP, and identify residual connections as the primary source of noise that degrades segmentation quality. With a comparative analysis of statistical properties in the residual connection and the attention output across different pretrained models, we discover that CLIP's image-text contrastive training paradigm emphasizes global features at the expense of local discriminability, leading to noisy segmentation results. In response, we propose ClearCLIP, a novel approach that decomposes CLIP's representations to enhance open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. We introduce three simple modifications to the final layer: removing the residual connection, implementing the self-self attention, and discarding the feed-forward network. ClearCLIP consistently generates clearer and more accurate segmentation maps and outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks, affirming the significance of our discoveries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024. code available at https://github.com/mc- lan/ClearCLIP</p></details> |

However, it is not only costly to obtain training-sufficient dense-annotated panoramas but also application-restricted when training models in a close-vocabulary setting. To tackle this problem, in this work, we define a new task termed Open Panoramic Segmentation (OPS), where models are trained with FoV-restricted pinhole images in the source domain in an open-vocabulary setting while evaluated with FoV-open panoramic images in the target domain, enabling the zero-shot open panoramic semantic segmentation ability of models. Moreover, we propose a model named OOOPS with a Deformable Adapter Network (DAN), which significantly improves zero-shot panoramic semantic segmentation performance. To further enhance the distortion-aware modeling ability from the pinhole source domain, we propose a novel data augmentation method called Random Equirectangular Projection (RERP) which is specifically designed to address object deformations in advance. Surpassing other state-of-the-art open-vocabulary semantic segmentation approaches, a remarkable performance boost on three panoramic datasets, WildPASS, Stanford2D3D, and Matterport3D, proves the effectiveness of our proposed OOOPS model with RERP on the OPS task, especially +2.2% on outdoor WildPASS and +2.4% mIoU on indoor Stanford2D3D.

Despite its success, its application to OVSS faces challenges due to its initial image-level alignment training, which affects its performance in tasks requiring detailed local context. Our study delves into the impact of CLIP's [CLS] token on patch feature correlations, revealing a dominance of "global" patches that hinders local feature discrimination. To overcome this, we propose CLIPtrase, a novel training-free semantic segmentation strategy that enhances local feature awareness through recalibrated self-correlation among patches. This approach demonstrates notable improvements in segmentation accuracy and the ability to maintain semantic coherence across objects.Experiments show that we are 22.3% ahead of CLIP on average on 9 segmentation benchmarks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art training-free methods.The code are made publicly available at: https://github.com/leaves162/CLIPtrase.</p></details> | ECCV24 accepted |

However, leveraging the learned association for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet extremely effective, training-free technique, Plug-and-Play Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (PnP-OVSS) for this task. PnP-OVSS leverages a VLM with direct text-to-image cross-attention and an image-text matching loss. To balance between over-segmentation and under-segmentation, we introduce Salience Dropout; by iteratively dropping patches that the model is most attentive to, we are able to better resolve the entire extent of the segmentation mask. PnP-OVSS does not require any neural network training and performs hyperparameter tuning without the need for any segmentation annotations, even for a validation set. PnP-OVSS demonstrates substantial improvements over comparable baselines (+26.2% mIoU on Pascal VOC, +20.5% mIoU on MS COCO, +3.1% mIoU on COCO Stuff and +3.0% mIoU on ADE20K).

| **[Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Image Embedding Balancing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09829v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is a challenging task, which requires the model to output semantic masks of an image beyond a close-set vocabulary. Although many efforts have been made to utilize powerful CLIP models to accomplish this task, they are still easily overfitting to training classes due to the natural gaps in semantic information between training and new classes. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel framework for openvocabulary semantic segmentation called EBSeg, incorporating an Adaptively Balanced Decoder (AdaB Decoder) and a Semantic Structure Consistency loss (SSC Loss). The AdaB Decoder is designed to generate different image embeddings for both training and new classes. Subsequently, these two types of embeddings are adaptively balanced to fully exploit their ability to recognize training classes and generalization ability for new classes. To learn a consistent semantic structure from CLIP, the SSC Loss aligns the inter-classes affinity in the image feature space with that in the text feature space of CLIP, thereby improving the generalization ability of our model. Furthermore, we employ a frozen SAM image encoder to complement the spatial information that CLIP features lack due to the low training image resolution and image-level supervision inherent in CLIP. Extensive experiments conducted across various benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed EBSeg outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code and trained models will be here: https://github.com/slonetime/EBSeg.</p></details> | CVPR2024 |

Previous works have trained over large amounts of image-caption pairs to enforce pixel-level multimodal alignments. However, captions provide global information about the semantics of a given image but lack direct localization of individual concepts. Further, training on large-scale datasets inevitably brings significant computational costs. In this paper, we propose FreeDA, a training-free diffusion-augmented method for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which leverages the ability of diffusion models to visually localize generated concepts and local-global similarities to match class-agnostic regions with semantic classes. Our approach involves an offline stage in which textual-visual reference embeddings are collected, starting from a large set of captions and leveraging visual and semantic contexts. At test time, these are queried to support the visual matching process, which is carried out by jointly considering class-agnostic regions and global semantic similarities. Extensive analyses demonstrate that FreeDA achieves state-of-the-art performance on five datasets, surpassing previous methods by more than 7.0 average points in terms of mIoU and without requiring any training.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024.

We address this limitation by introducing Generalizable Open-Vocabulary Neural Semantic Fields (GOV-NeSF), a novel approach offering a generalizable implicit representation of 3D scenes with open-vocabulary semantics. We aggregate the geometry-aware features using a cost volume, and propose a Multi-view Joint Fusion module to aggregate multi-view features through a cross-view attention mechanism, which effectively predicts view-specific blending weights for both colors and open-vocabulary features.

| **[Image-to-Image Matching via Foundation Models: A New Perspective for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00262v1)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment images of arbitrary categories specified by class labels or captions. However, most previous best-performing methods, whether pixel grouping methods or region recognition methods, suffer from false matches between image features and category labels. We attribute this to the natural gap between the textual features and visual features. In this work, we rethink how to mitigate false matches from the perspective of image-to-image matching and propose a novel relation-aware intra-modal matching (RIM) framework for OVS based on visual foundation models. RIM achieves robust region classification by firstly constructing diverse image-modal reference features and then matching them with region features based on relation-aware ranking distribution. The proposed RIM enjoys several merits. First, the intra-modal reference features are better aligned, circumventing potential ambiguities that may arise in cross-modal matching. Second, the ranking-based matching process harnesses the structure information implicit in the inter-class relationships, making it more robust than comparing individually. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that RIM outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, obtaining a lead of more than 10% in mIoU on PASCAL VOC benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2024 |

However, its lack of spatial awareness makes it unsuitable for dense computer vision tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation, without an additional fine-tuning step that often uses annotations and can potentially suppress its original open-vocabulary properties. Meanwhile, self-supervised representation methods have demonstrated good localization properties without human-made annotations nor explicit supervision. In this work, we take the best of both worlds and propose an open-vocabulary semantic segmentation method, which does not require any annotations. We propose to locally improve dense MaskCLIP features, which are computed with a simple modification of CLIP's last pooling layer, by integrating localization priors extracted from self-supervised features. By doing so, we greatly improve the performance of MaskCLIP and produce smooth outputs. Moreover, we show that the used self-supervised feature properties can directly be learnt from CLIP features. Our method CLIP-DINOiser needs only a single forward pass of CLIP and two light convolutional layers at inference, no extra supervision nor extra memory and reaches state-of-the-art results on challenging and fine-grained benchmarks such as COCO, Pascal Context, Cityscapes and ADE20k.

Nevertheless, current approaches encounter an alignment granularity gap owing to the absence of dense annotations, wherein they learn coarse image/region-text alignment during training yet perform group/pixel-level predictions at inference. Such discrepancy leads to suboptimal learning efficiency and inferior zero-shot segmentation results. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Grained Cross-modal Alignment (MGCA) framework, which explicitly learns pixel-level alignment along with object- and region-level alignment to bridge the granularity gap without any dense annotations. Specifically, MGCA ingeniously constructs pseudo multi-granular semantic correspondences upon image-text pairs and collaborates with hard sampling strategies to facilitate fine-grained cross-modal contrastive learning. Further, we point out the defects of existing group and pixel prediction units in downstream segmentation and develop an adaptive semantic unit which effectively mitigates their dilemmas including under- and over-segmentation. Training solely on CC3M, our method achieves significant advancements over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

Most existing methods explore utilizing pre-trained vision-language models, in which the key is to adopt the image-level model for pixel-level segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a simple encoder-decoder, named SED, for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which comprises a hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation and a gradual fusion decoder with category early rejection. The hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation employs hierarchical backbone, instead of plain transformer, to predict pixel-level image-text cost map. Compared to plain transformer, hierarchical backbone better captures local spatial information and has linear computational complexity with respect to input size. Our gradual fusion decoder employs a top-down structure to combine cost map and the feature maps of different backbone levels for segmentation. To accelerate inference speed, we introduce a category early rejection scheme in the decoder that rejects many no-existing categories at the early layer of decoder, resulting in at most 4.7 times acceleration without accuracy degradation. Experiments are performed on multiple open-vocabulary semantic segmentation datasets, which demonstrates the efficacy of our SED method. When using ConvNeXt-B, our SED method achieves mIoU score of 31.6\% on ADE20K with 150 categories at 82 millisecond ($ms$) per image on a single A6000.

Due to the visual data sparsity and the difficulty of generalizing from seen to unseen categories, this task remains challenging. To better generalize to unseen classes, we propose Conditional tOken aligNment and Cycle trAnsiTion (CONCAT), to produce generalizable semantic vision queries. First, a feature extractor is trained by CON to link the vision and semantics for providing target queries. Formally, CON is proposed to align the semantic queries with the CLIP visual CLS token extracted from complete and masked images. To address the lack of unseen categories, a generator is required. However, one of the gaps in synthesizing pseudo vision queries, ie, vision queries for unseen categories, is describing fine-grained visual details through semantic embeddings. Therefore, we approach CAT to train the generator in semantic-vision and vision-semantic manners. In semantic-vision, visual query contrast is proposed to model the high granularity of vision by pulling the pseudo vision queries with the corresponding targets containing segments while pushing those without segments away. To ensure the generated queries retain semantic information, in vision-semantic, the pseudo vision queries are mapped back to semantic and supervised by real semantic embeddings. Experiments on ZPS achieve a 5.2% hPQ increase surpassing SOTA. We also examine inductive ZPS and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation and obtain comparative results while being 2 times faster in testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Generative and Discriminative Models for Unified Visual Perception with Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16459v1)** | 2024-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable prowess of diffusion models in image generation has spurred efforts to extend their application beyond generative tasks. However, a persistent challenge exists in lacking a unified approach to apply diffusion models to visual perception tasks with diverse semantic granularity requirements. Our purpose is to establish a unified visual perception framework, capitalizing on the potential synergies between generative and discriminative models. In this paper, we propose Vermouth, a simple yet effective framework comprising a pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model containing rich generative priors, a unified head (U-head) capable of integrating hierarchical representations, and an adapted expert providing discriminative priors. Comprehensive investigations unveil potential characteristics of Vermouth, such as varying granularity of perception concealed in latent variables at distinct time steps and various U-net stages. We emphasize that there is no necessity for incorporating a heavyweight or intricate decoder to transform diffusion models into potent representation learners. Extensive comparative evaluations against tailored discriminative models showcase the efficacy of our approach on zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR), few-shot classification, and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks. The promising results demonstrate the potential of diffusion models as formidable learners, establishing their significance in furnishing informative and robust visual representations.</p></details> | 18 pages,11 figures |
| **[Exploring Simple Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12217v1)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation models aim to accurately assign a semantic label to each pixel in an image from a set of arbitrary open-vocabulary texts. In order to learn such pixel-level alignment, current approaches typically rely on a combination of (i) image-level VL model (e.g. CLIP), (ii) ground truth masks, and (iii) custom grouping encoders. In this paper, we introduce S-Seg, a novel model that can achieve surprisingly strong performance without depending on any of the above elements. S-Seg leverages pseudo-mask and language to train a MaskFormer, and can be easily trained from publicly available image-text datasets. Contrary to prior works, our model directly trains for pixel-level features and language alignment. Once trained, S-Seg generalizes well to multiple testing datasets without requiring fine-tuning. In addition, S-Seg has the extra benefits of scalability with data and consistently improvement when augmented with self-training. We believe that our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/zlai0/S-Seg</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Model is Secretly a Training-free Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmenter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02773v3)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-trained text-image discriminative models, such as CLIP, has been explored for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with unsatisfactory results due to the loss of crucial localization information and awareness of object shapes. Recently, there has been a growing interest in expanding the application of generative models from generation tasks to semantic segmentation. These approaches utilize generative models either for generating annotated data or extracting features to facilitate semantic segmentation. This typically involves generating a considerable amount of synthetic data or requiring additional mask annotations. To this end, we uncover the potential of generative text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) as highly efficient open-vocabulary semantic segmenters, and introduce a novel training-free approach named DiffSegmenter. The insight is that to generate realistic objects that are semantically faithful to the input text, both the complete object shapes and the corresponding semantics are implicitly learned by diffusion models. We discover that the object shapes are characterized by the self-attention maps while the semantics are indicated through the cross-attention maps produced by the denoising U-Net, forming the basis of our segmentation results.Additionally, we carefully design effective textual prompts and a category filtering mechanism to further enhance the segmentation results. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed DiffSegmenter achieves impressive results for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Such methods are able to segment scenes into arbitrary classes based on text descriptions provided during runtime. In this paper, we propose to the best of our knowledge the first algorithm for open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation in 3D scenes. Our algorithm, Panoptic Vision-Language Feature Fields (PVLFF), learns a semantic feature field of the scene by distilling vision-language features from a pretrained 2D model, and jointly fits an instance feature field through contrastive learning using 2D instance segments on input frames. Despite not being trained on the target classes, our method achieves panoptic segmentation performance similar to the state-of-the-art closed-set 3D systems on the HyperSim, ScanNet and Replica dataset and additionally outperforms current 3D open-vocabulary systems in terms of semantic segmentation. We ablate the components of our method to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model architecture.

| **[AttrSeg: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation via Attribute Decomposition-Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00096v2)** | 2024-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is a challenging task that requires segmenting novel object categories at inference time. Recent studies have explored vision-language pre-training to handle this task, but suffer from unrealistic assumptions in practical scenarios, i.e., low-quality textual category names. For example, this paradigm assumes that new textual categories will be accurately and completely provided, and exist in lexicons during pre-training. However, exceptions often happen when encountering ambiguity for brief or incomplete names, new words that are not present in the pre-trained lexicons, and difficult-to-describe categories for users. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel attribute decomposition-aggregation framework, AttrSeg, inspired by human cognition in understanding new concepts. Specifically, in the decomposition stage, we decouple class names into diverse attribute descriptions to complement semantic contexts from multiple perspectives. Two attribute construction strategies are designed: using large language models for common categories, and involving manually labeling for human-invented categories. In the aggregation stage, we group diverse attributes into an integrated global description, to form a discriminative classifier that distinguishes the target object from others. One hierarchical aggregation architecture is further proposed to achieve multi-level aggregations, leveraging the meticulously designed clustering module. The final results are obtained by computing the similarity between aggregated attributes and images embeddings. To evaluate the effectiveness, we annotate three types of datasets with attribute descriptions, and conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies. The results show the superior performance of attribute decomposition-aggregation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |

The zero-shot classification capabilities of the model are impressive but are harder to use for dense tasks such as image segmentation. Several methods have proposed different modifications and learning schemes to produce dense output. Instead, we propose in this work an open-vocabulary semantic segmentation method, dubbed CLIP-DIY, which does not require any additional training or annotations, but instead leverages existing unsupervised object localization approaches. In particular, CLIP-DIY is a multi-scale approach that directly exploits CLIP classification abilities on patches of different sizes and aggregates the decision in a single map. We further guide the segmentation using foreground/background scores obtained using unsupervised object localization methods. With our method, we obtain state-of-the-art zero-shot semantic segmentation results on PASCAL VOC and perform on par with the best methods on COCO.

| **[Convolutions Die Hard: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation with Single Frozen Convolutional CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02487v2)** | 2023-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary segmentation is a challenging task requiring segmenting and recognizing objects from an open set of categories. One way to address this challenge is to leverage multi-modal models, such as CLIP, to provide image and text features in a shared embedding space, which bridges the gap between closed-vocabulary and open-vocabulary recognition. Hence, existing methods often adopt a two-stage framework to tackle the problem, where the inputs first go through a mask generator and then through the CLIP model along with the predicted masks. This process involves extracting features from images multiple times, which can be ineffective and inefficient. By contrast, we propose to build everything into a single-stage framework using a shared Frozen Convolutional CLIP backbone, which not only significantly simplifies the current two-stage pipeline, but also remarkably yields a better accuracy-cost trade-off. The proposed FC-CLIP, benefits from the following observations: the frozen CLIP backbone maintains the ability of open-vocabulary classification and can also serve as a strong mask generator, and the convolutional CLIP generalizes well to a larger input resolution than the one used during contrastive image-text pretraining. When training on COCO panoptic data only and testing in a zero-shot manner, FC-CLIP achieve 26.8 PQ, 16.8 AP, and 34.1 mIoU on ADE20K, 18.2 PQ, 27.9 mIoU on Mapillary Vistas, 44.0 PQ, 26.8 AP, 56.2 mIoU on Cityscapes, outperforming the prior art by +4.2 PQ, +2.4 AP, +4.2 mIoU on ADE20K, +4.0 PQ on Mapillary Vistas and +20.1 PQ on Cityscapes, respectively. Additionally, the training and testing time of FC-CLIP is 7.5x and 6.6x significantly faster than the same prior art, while using 5.9x fewer parameters. FC-CLIP also sets a new state-of-the-art performance across various open-vocabulary semantic segmentation datasets.

Existing works turn to enhance the vanilla vision transformer by introducing explicit grouping recognition, i.e., employing several group tokens/centroids to cluster the image tokens and perform the group-text alignment. Nevertheless, these methods suffer from a granularity inconsistency regarding the usage of group tokens, which are aligned in the all-to-one v.s. one-to-one manners during the training and inference phases, respectively. We argue that this discrepancy arises from the lack of elaborate supervision for each group token. To bridge this granularity gap, this paper explores explicit supervision for the group tokens from the prototypical knowledge. To this end, this paper proposes the non-learnable prototypical regularization (NPR) where non-learnable prototypes are estimated from source features to serve as supervision and enable contrastive matching of the group tokens. This regularization encourages the group tokens to segment objects with less redundancy and capture more comprehensive semantic regions, leading to increased compactness and richness. Based on NPR, we propose the prototypical guidance segmentation network (PGSeg) that incorporates multi-modal regularization by leveraging prototypical sources from both images and texts at different levels, progressively enhancing the segmentation capability with diverse prototypical patterns. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

While significant progress has been made in object-level Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS), i.e., segmenting objects with arbitrary text, the corresponding part-level research poses additional challenges. Firstly, part segmentation inherently involves intricate boundaries, while limited annotated data compounds the challenge. Secondly, part segmentation introduces an open granularity challenge due to the diverse and often ambiguous definitions of parts in the open world. Furthermore, the large-scale vision and language models, which play a key role in the open vocabulary setting, struggle to recognize parts as effectively as objects. To comprehensively investigate and tackle these challenges, we propose an Open-Vocabulary Part Segmentation (OV-PARTS) benchmark. OV-PARTS includes refined versions of two publicly available datasets: Pascal-Part-116 and ADE20K-Part-234. And it covers three specific tasks: Generalized Zero-Shot Part Segmentation, Cross-Dataset Part Segmentation, and Few-Shot Part Segmentation, providing insights into analogical reasoning, open granularity and few-shot adapting abilities of models. Moreover, we analyze and adapt two prevailing paradigms of existing object-level OVSS methods for OV-PARTS. Extensive experimental analysis is conducted to inspire future research in leveraging foundational models for OV-PARTS.

| **[Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Decoupled One-Pass Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01198v2)** | 2023-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the open-vocabulary semantic segmentation problem has attracted increasing attention and the best performing methods are based on two-stream networks: one stream for proposal mask generation and the other for segment classification using a pretrained visual-language model. However, existing two-stream methods require passing a great number of (up to a hundred) image crops into the visual-language model, which is highly inefficient. To address the problem, we propose a network that only needs a single pass through the visual-language model for each input image. Specifically, we first propose a novel network adaptation approach, termed patch severance, to restrict the harmful interference between the patch embeddings in the pre-trained visual encoder. We then propose classification anchor learning to encourage the network to spatially focus on more discriminative features for classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods while being 4 to 7 times faster at inference.

| **[Global Knowledge Calibration for Fast Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09181v2)** | 2023-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, have enabled the segmentation of arbitrary concepts solely from textual inputs, a process commonly referred to as open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS). However, existing OVS techniques confront a fundamental challenge: the trained classifier tends to overfit on the base classes observed during training, resulting in suboptimal generalization performance to unseen classes. To mitigate this issue, recent studies have proposed the use of an additional frozen pre-trained CLIP for classification. Nonetheless, this approach incurs heavy computational overheads as the CLIP vision encoder must be repeatedly forward-passed for each mask, rendering it impractical for real-world applications. To address this challenge, our objective is to develop a fast OVS model that can perform comparably or better without the extra computational burden of the CLIP image encoder during inference. To this end, we propose a core idea of preserving the generalizable representation when fine-tuning on known classes. Specifically, we introduce a text diversification strategy that generates a set of synonyms for each training category, which prevents the learned representation from collapsing onto specific known category names. Additionally, we employ a text-guided knowledge distillation method to preserve the generalizable knowledge of CLIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves robust generalization performance across various datasets. Furthermore, we perform a preliminary exploration of open-vocabulary video segmentation and present a benchmark that can facilitate future open-vocabulary research in the video domain.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2023 |

The pre-trained model can capture enriched visual concepts for images by learning from a large scale of text-image data. However, transferring the learned visual knowledge to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a CLIP-based model named SegCLIP for the topic of open-vocabulary segmentation in an annotation-free manner. The SegCLIP achieves segmentation based on ViT and the main idea is to gather patches with learnable centers to semantic regions through training on text-image pairs. The gathering operation can dynamically capture the semantic groups, which can be used to generate the final segmentation results. We further propose a reconstruction loss on masked patches and a superpixel-based KL loss with pseudo-labels to enhance the visual representation. Experimental results show that our model achieves comparable or superior segmentation accuracy on the PASCAL VOC 2012 (+0.3% mIoU), PASCAL Context (+2.3% mIoU), and COCO (+2.2% mIoU) compared with baselines. We release the code at https://github.com/ArrowLuo/SegCLIP.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often rely on expensive human annotations as supervision for model training, limiting their scalability to large, unlabeled datasets. To address this challenge, we present ZeroSeg, a novel method that leverages the existing pretrained vision-language (VL) model (e.g. CLIP) to train open-vocabulary zero-shot semantic segmentation models. Although acquired extensive knowledge of visual concepts, it is non-trivial to exploit knowledge from these VL models to the task of semantic segmentation, as they are usually trained at an image level. ZeroSeg overcomes this by distilling the visual concepts learned by VL models into a set of segment tokens, each summarizing a localized region of the target image. We evaluate ZeroSeg on multiple popular segmentation benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO, in a zero-shot manner (i.e., no training or adaption on target segmentation datasets). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared to other zero-shot segmentation methods under the same training data, while also performing competitively compared to strongly supervised methods. Finally, we also demonstrated the effectiveness of ZeroSeg on open-vocabulary segmentation, through both human studies and qualitative visualizations.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the natural ability of humans to identify objects through the visualization of depth maps, SAD utilizes SAM to segment the rendered depth map, thus providing cues with enhanced geometry information and mitigating the issue of over-segmentation.

In this work, we first demonstrate the necessity of image-pixel CLIP feature adaption, then provide Multi-View Prompt learning (MVP-SEG) as an effective solution to achieve image-pixel adaptation and to solve open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Concretely, MVP-SEG deliberately learns multiple prompts trained by our Orthogonal Constraint Loss (OCLoss), by which each prompt is supervised to exploit CLIP feature on different object parts, and collaborative segmentation masks generated by all prompts promote better segmentation. Moreover, MVP-SEG introduces Global Prompt Refining (GPR) to further eliminate class-wise segmentation noise. Experiments show that the multi-view prompts learned from seen categories have strong generalization to unseen categories, and MVP-SEG+ which combines the knowledge transfer stage significantly outperforms previous methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, qualitative results justify that MVP-SEG does lead to better focus on different local parts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Mask-adapted CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04150v3)** | 2023-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to segment an image into semantic regions according to text descriptions, which may not have been seen during training. Recent two-stage methods first generate class-agnostic mask proposals and then leverage pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, to classify masked regions. We identify the performance bottleneck of this paradigm to be the pre-trained CLIP model, since it does not perform well on masked images. To address this, we propose to finetune CLIP on a collection of masked image regions and their corresponding text descriptions. We collect training data by mining an existing image-caption dataset (e.g., COCO Captions), using CLIP to match masked image regions to nouns in the image captions. Compared with the more precise and manually annotated segmentation labels with fixed classes (e.g., COCO-Stuff), we find our noisy but diverse dataset can better retain CLIP's generalization ability. Along with finetuning the entire model, we utilize the "blank" areas in masked images using a method we dub mask prompt tuning. Experiments demonstrate mask prompt tuning brings significant improvement without modifying any weights of CLIP, and it can further improve a fully finetuned model. In particular, when trained on COCO and evaluated on ADE20K-150, our best model achieves 29.6% mIoU, which is +8.5% higher than the previous state-of-the-art. For the first time, open-vocabulary generalist models match the performance of supervised specialist models in 2017 without dataset-specific adaptations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2023.

| **[Side Adapter Network for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12242v2)** | 2023-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a new framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with the pre-trained vision-language model, named Side Adapter Network (SAN). Our approach models the semantic segmentation task as a region recognition problem. A side network is attached to a frozen CLIP model with two branches: one for predicting mask proposals, and the other for predicting attention bias which is applied in the CLIP model to recognize the class of masks. This decoupled design has the benefit CLIP in recognizing the class of mask proposals. Since the attached side network can reuse CLIP features, it can be very light. In addition, the entire network can be trained end-to-end, allowing the side network to be adapted to the frozen CLIP model, which makes the predicted mask proposals CLIP-aware. Our approach is fast, accurate, and only adds a few additional trainable parameters. We evaluate our approach on multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our method significantly outperforms other counterparts, with up to 18 times fewer trainable parameters and 19 times faster inference speed. We hope our approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

| **[Learning Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation Models From Natural Language Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09121v2)** | 2023-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider the problem of open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS), which aims to segment objects of arbitrary classes instead of pre-defined, closed-set categories. The main contributions are as follows: First, we propose a transformer-based model for OVS, termed as OVSegmentor, which only exploits web-crawled image-text pairs for pre-training without using any mask annotations. OVSegmentor assembles the image pixels into a set of learnable group tokens via a slot-attention based binding module, and aligns the group tokens to the corresponding caption embedding. Second, we propose two proxy tasks for training, namely masked entity completion and cross-image mask consistency. The former aims to infer all masked entities in the caption given the group tokens, that enables the model to learn fine-grained alignment between visual groups and text entities. The latter enforces consistent mask predictions between images that contain shared entities, which encourages the model to learn visual invariance. Third, we construct CC4M dataset for pre-training by filtering CC12M with frequently appeared entities, which significantly improves training efficiency. Fourth, we perform zero-shot transfer on three benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object. Our model achieves superior segmentation results over the state-of-the-art method by using only 3\% data (4M vs 134M) for pre-training. Code and pre-trained models will be released for future research.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2023 |
| **[A Language-Guided Benchmark for Weakly Supervised Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14163v1)** | 2023-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasing attention is being diverted to data-efficient problem settings like Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) which deals with segmenting an arbitrary object that may or may not be seen during training. The closest standard problems related to OVSS are Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Segmentation (ZSS, FSS) and their Cross-dataset variants where zero to few annotations are needed to segment novel classes. The existing FSS and ZSS methods utilize fully supervised pixel-labelled seen classes to segment unseen classes. Pixel-level labels are hard to obtain, and using weak supervision in the form of inexpensive image-level labels is often more practical. To this end, we propose a novel unified weakly supervised OVSS pipeline that can perform ZSS, FSS and Cross-dataset segmentation on novel classes without using pixel-level labels for either the base (seen) or the novel (unseen) classes in an inductive setting. We propose Weakly-Supervised Language-Guided Segmentation Network (WLSegNet), a novel language-guided segmentation pipeline that i) learns generalizable context vectors with batch aggregates (mean) to map class prompts to image features using frozen CLIP (a vision-language model) and ii) decouples weak ZSS/FSS into weak semantic segmentation and Zero-Shot segmentation. The learned context vectors avoid overfitting on seen classes during training and transfer better to novel classes during testing. WLSegNet avoids fine-tuning and the use of external datasets during training. The proposed pipeline beats existing methods for weak generalized Zero-Shot and weak Few-Shot semantic segmentation by 39 and 3 mIOU points respectively on PASCAL VOC and weak Few-Shot semantic segmentation by 5 mIOU points on MS COCO. On a harder setting of 2-way 1-shot weak FSS, WLSegNet beats the baselines by 13 and 22 mIOU points on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class Enhancement Losses with Pseudo Labels for Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07336v1)** | 2023-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent mask proposal models have significantly improved the performance of zero-shot semantic segmentation. However, the use of a `background' embedding during training in these methods is problematic as the resulting model tends to over-learn and assign all unseen classes as the background class instead of their correct labels. Furthermore, they ignore the semantic relationship of text embeddings, which arguably can be highly informative for zero-shot prediction as seen classes may have close relationship with unseen classes. To this end, this paper proposes novel class enhancement losses to bypass the use of the background embbedding during training, and simultaneously exploit the semantic relationship between text embeddings and mask proposals by ranking the similarity scores. To further capture the relationship between seen and unseen classes, we propose an effective pseudo label generation pipeline using pretrained vision-language model. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our method achieves overall the best performance for zero-shot semantic segmentation. Our method is flexible, and can also be applied to the challenging open-vocabulary semantic segmentation problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Baseline for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Pre-trained Vision-language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14757v2)** | 2022-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, open-vocabulary image classification by vision language pre-training has demonstrated incredible achievements, that the model can classify arbitrary categories without seeing additional annotated images of that category. However, it is still unclear how to make the open-vocabulary recognition work well on broader vision problems. This paper targets open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by building it on an off-the-shelf pre-trained vision-language model, i.e., CLIP. However, semantic segmentation and the CLIP model perform on different visual granularity, that semantic segmentation processes on pixels while CLIP performs on images. To remedy the discrepancy in processing granularity, we refuse the use of the prevalent one-stage FCN based framework, and advocate a two-stage semantic segmentation framework, with the first stage extracting generalizable mask proposals and the second stage leveraging an image based CLIP model to perform open-vocabulary classification on the masked image crops which are generated in the first stage. Our experimental results show that this two-stage framework can achieve superior performance than FCN when trained only on COCO Stuff dataset and evaluated on other datasets without fine-tuning. Moreover, this simple framework also surpasses previous state-of-the-arts of zero-shot semantic segmentation by a large margin: +29.5 hIoU on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset, and +8.9 hIoU on the COCO Stuff dataset. With its simplicity and strong performance, we hope this framework to serve as a baseline to facilitate future research.

With such an alignment, a model can identify regions of an image corresponding to a given text input, and therefore transfer seamlessly to the task of open vocabulary semantic segmentation without requiring any segmentation annotations during training. Using pre-trained CLIP encoders with PACL, we are able to set the state-of-the-art on the task of open vocabulary zero-shot segmentation on 4 different segmentation benchmarks: Pascal VOC, Pascal Context, COCO Stuff and ADE20K. Furthermore, we show that PACL is also applicable to image-level predictions and when used with a CLIP backbone, provides a general improvement in zero-shot classification accuracy compared to CLIP, across a suite of 12 image classification datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate simple, yet effective approaches for adapting the pre-trained foundation models to the downstream task of interest, namely, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) we introduce Fusioner, with a lightweight, transformer-based fusion module, that pairs the frozen visual representation with language concept through a handful of image segmentation data. As a consequence, the model gains the capability of zero-shot transfer to segment novel categories; (ii) without loss of generality, we experiment on a broad range of self-supervised models that have been pre-trained with different schemes, e.g. visual-only models (MoCo v3, DINO), language-only models (BERT), visual-language model (CLIP), and show that, the proposed fusion approach is effective to any pair of visual and language models, even those pre-trained on a corpus of uni-modal data; (iii) we conduct thorough ablation studies to analyze the critical components in our proposed Fusioner, while evaluating on standard benchmarks, e.g. PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i , it surpasses existing state-of-the-art models by a large margin, despite only being trained on frozen visual and language features; (iv) to measure the model's robustness on learning visual-language correspondence, we further evaluate on synthetic dataset, named Mosaic-4, where images are constructed by mosaicking the samples from FSS-1000. Fusioner demonstrates superior performance over previous models.</p></details> | BMVC 2022 Oral |

Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pre-trained on millions of natural images, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot segmentation performance, providing a potential solution. However, SAM struggles with geographical images, such as aerial and satellite imagery, due to its training being confined to natural images and the narrow features and textures of these objects blending into their surroundings. To address these challenges, we propose Geographical SAM (GeoSAM), a SAM-based framework that fine-tunes SAM using automatically generated multi-modal prompts. Specifically, GeoSAM integrates point prompts from a pre-trained task-specific model as primary visual guidance, and text prompts generated by a large language model as secondary semantic guidance, enabling the model to better capture both spatial structure and contextual meaning. GeoSAM outperforms existing approaches for mobility infrastructure segmentation in both familiar and completely unseen regions by at least 5\% in mIoU, representing a significant leap in leveraging foundation models to segment mobility infrastructure, including both road and pedestrian infrastructure in geographical images.

| **[Adapting SAM via Cross-Entropy Masking for Class Imbalance in Remote Sensing Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10568v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational models have achieved significant success in diverse domains of computer vision. They learn general representations that are easily transferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is Segment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images. We propose adapting the SAM encoder via fine-tuning for remote sensing change detection (RSCD) along with spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) and multi-scale decoder fusion (MSDF) to detect changes robustly at multiple scales. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss to handle high class imbalance in change detection datasets. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four change detection datasets, Levir-CD, WHU-CD, CLCD, and S2Looking. We achieved 2.5% F1-score improvement on a large complex S2Looking dataset. The code is available at: https://github.com/humza909/SAM-CEM-CD</p></details> | work in progress |

Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However, VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously. Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers, achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective, optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and indicator measurements. The code will be available at https://github.com/QC-LIU-1997/AutoSAME.</p></details> |  |

The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown great effectiveness across various video segmentation tasks. However, its application to offline RVOS is challenged by the translation of the text into effective prompts and a lack of global context awareness. In this paper, we propose a novel RVOS framework, termed MPG-SAM 2, to address these challenges. Specifically, MPG-SAM 2 employs a unified multimodal encoder to jointly encode video and textual features, generating semantically aligned video and text embeddings, along with multimodal class tokens. A mask prior generator utilizes the video embeddings and class tokens to create pseudo masks of target objects and global context. These masks are fed into the prompt encoder as dense prompts along with multimodal class tokens as sparse prompts to generate accurate prompts for SAM 2. To provide the online SAM 2 with a global view, we introduce a hierarchical global-historical aggregator, which allows SAM 2 to aggregate global and historical information of target objects at both pixel and object levels, enhancing the target representation and temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on several RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MPG-SAM 2 and the effectiveness of our proposed modules. The code is available at https://github.com/rongfu-dsb/MPG-SAM2.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[SAM Encoder Breach by Adversarial Simplicial Complex Triggers Downstream Model Failures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06127v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications. Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative. Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex. Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,recived by ICCV2025</p></details> |
| **[SGDFuse: SAM-Guided Diffusion for High-Fidelity Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05264v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks. However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at https://github.com/boshizhang123/SGDFuse.</p></details> | Submitted to TCSVT |
| **[Segment Any Vehicle: Semantic and Visual Context Driven SAM and A Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04260v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception, particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge. Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. % Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released upon acceptance. Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/SAV</p></details> |  |
| **[BrainSegDMlF: A Dynamic Fusion-enhanced SAM for Brain Lesion Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06133v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The segmentation of substantial brain lesions is a significant and challenging task in the field of medical image segmentation. Substantial brain lesions in brain imaging exhibit high heterogeneity, with indistinct boundaries between lesion regions and normal brain tissue. Small lesions in single slices are difficult to identify, making the accurate and reproducible segmentation of abnormal regions, as well as their feature description, highly complex. Existing methods have the following limitations: 1) They rely solely on single-modal information for learning, neglecting the multi-modal information commonly used in diagnosis. This hampers the ability to comprehensively acquire brain lesion information from multiple perspectives and prevents the effective integration and utilization of multi-modal data inputs, thereby limiting a holistic understanding of lesions. 2) They are constrained by the amount of data available, leading to low sensitivity to small lesions and difficulty in detecting subtle pathological changes. 3) Current SAM-based models rely on external prompts, which cannot achieve automatic segmentation and, to some extent, affect diagnostic efficiency.To address these issues, we have developed a large-scale fully automated segmentation model specifically designed for brain lesion segmentation, named BrainSegDMLF. This model has the following features: 1) Dynamic Modal Interactive Fusion (DMIF) module that processes and integrates multi-modal data during the encoding process, providing the SAM encoder with more comprehensive modal information. 2) Layer-by-Layer Upsampling Decoder, enabling the model to extract rich low-level and high-level features even with limited data, thereby detecting the presence of small lesions. 3) Automatic segmentation masks, allowing the model to generate lesion masks automatically without requiring manual prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming SAM for Underwater Instance Segmentation and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15581v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With recent breakthroughs in large-scale modeling, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in a variety of visual applications. However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts, thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets. Datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/LiamLian0727/UIIS10K.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProSAM: Enhancing the Robustness of SAM-based Visual Reference Segmentation with Probabilistic Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21835v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes, texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts at boundaries of target regions due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[SAM-PTx: Text-Guided Fine-Tuning of SAM with Parameter-Efficient, Parallel-Text Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00213v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAM: A Stability-Aware Cache Manager for Multi-Tenant Embedded Databases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22701v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The co-location of multiple database instances on resource constrained edge nodes creates significant cache contention, where traditional schemes are inefficient and unstable under dynamic workloads. To address this, we present SAM(a Stability-Aware Manager), an autonomic cache manager that establishes decision stability as a first-class design principle. It achieves this through its core control policy, AURA(Autonomic Utility-balancing Resource Allocator), which resolves the classic exploitation-exploration dilemma by synthesizing two orthogonal factors: the H-factor, representing proven historical efficiency (exploitation), and the V-factor, for estimated marginal gain (exploration). Through this practical synthesis and adaptive control, SAM achieves sustained high performance with strategic stability and robustness in volatile conditions. Extensive experiments against 14 diverse baselines demonstrate SAM's superiority. It achieves top-tier throughput while being uniquely resilient to complex workload shifts and adversarial workloads like cache pollution. Furthermore, its decision latency is highly scalable, remaining nearly constant as the system grows to 120 databases. Crucially, SAM achieves superior decision stability -- maintaining consistent optimization directions despite noise, avoiding performance oscillations while ensuring predictable Quality of Service. These results prove that a principled, stability-aware design is essential for sustained high performance in real-world, large-scale systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures.

However, existing SSCOD methods based on Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically, ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training. Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient SSCOD.

However, the speckle noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight, text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas, TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation, TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS segmentation.

The crucial design of SAM 2 for video segmentation is its memory module, which prompts object-aware memories from previous frames for current frame prediction. However, its greedy-selection memory design suffers from the "error accumulation" problem, where an errored or missed mask will cascade and influence the segmentation of the subsequent frames, which limits the performance of SAM 2 toward complex long-term videos. To this end, we introduce SAM2Long, an improved training-free video object segmentation strategy, which considers the segmentation uncertainty within each frame and chooses the video-level optimal results from multiple segmentation pathways in a constrained tree search manner. In practice, we maintain a fixed number of segmentation pathways throughout the video. For each frame, multiple masks are proposed based on the existing pathways, creating various candidate branches. We then select the same fixed number of branches with higher cumulative scores as the new pathways for the next frame. After processing the final frame, the pathway with the highest cumulative score is chosen as the final segmentation result. Benefiting from its heuristic search design, SAM2Long is robust toward occlusions and object reappearances, and can effectively segment and track objects for complex long-term videos. Notably, SAM2Long achieves an average improvement of 3.0 points across all 24 head-to-head comparisons, with gains of up to 5.3 points in J&F on long-term video object segmentation benchmarks such as SA-V and LVOS.

| **[Fully Automated SAM for Single-source Domain Generalization in Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17281v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although SAM-based single-source domain generalization models for medical image segmentation can mitigate the impact of domain shift on the model in cross-domain scenarios, these models still face two major challenges. First, the segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated prompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image segmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second, providing poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large) to the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask results. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain generalization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully automated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted Generation Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty Modeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module integrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty distribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding box prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with SAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image embeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the target object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts. Extensive experiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate the effectiveness of FA-SAM and highlight its potential to address the above challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for presentation at the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (IEEE SMC 2025) and is copyrighted by IEEE</p></details> |

Recent foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization capability in general segmentation tasks, making it a promising solution for few-shot scenarios. However, adapting SAM to CD-FSS faces two critical challenges: reliance on manual prompt and limited cross-domain ability. Therefore, we propose the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework that introduces three key modules: (i) the Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for semantic expansion, (ii) the Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) module for automated meta-prompt synthesis, and (iii) the Frequency-Aware Interaction (FAI) module for domain discrepancy mitigation. Evaluations across four cross-domain datasets demonstrate CMP's state-of-the-art performance, achieving 71.8\% and 74.5\% mIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios respectively.</p></details> | 3 figures |

Additionally, reliance on large-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and error-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong generalizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts, effectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since manually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and time-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework based on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated image, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional annotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation (CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to adapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead of dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for iterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality. Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness. Notably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 11.44%.</p></details> | accepted by ICCV2025 |

To harness the vast pool of unlabeled remote sensing data, we propose SAMST, a semi-supervised semantic segmentation method. SAMST leverages the strengths of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in zero-shot generalization and boundary detection. SAMST iteratively refines pseudo-labels through two main components: supervised model self-training using both labeled and pseudo-labeled data, and a SAM-based Pseudo-label Refiner. The Pseudo-label Refiner comprises three modules: a Threshold Filter Module for preprocessing, a Prompt Generation Module for extracting connected regions and generating prompts for SAM, and a Label Refinement Module for final label stitching. By integrating the generalization power of large models with the training efficiency of small models, SAMST improves pseudo-label accuracy, thereby enhancing overall model performance. Experiments on the Potsdam dataset validate the effectiveness and feasibility of SAMST, demonstrating its potential to address the challenges posed by limited labeled data in remote sensing semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>IGARS...</summary><p>IGARSS2025 accepted, Correspondence: fujianhai2024@gmail.com (J.F.), cuichj@mail2.sysu.edu.cn (C.C.)</p></details> |

While psychological explanations such as the ideomotor effect exist, a computational understanding of how decentralized, implicit linguistic knowledge fuses through shared physical interaction remains elusive. We introduce CoCre-Sam (Collective-Creature Sampling), a framework modeling this phenomenon as collective Langevin dynamics sampling from implicitly fused language models. Each participant is represented as an agent associated with an energy landscape derived from an internal language model reflecting linguistic priors, and agents exert stochastic forces based on local energy gradients. We theoretically prove that the collective motion of the shared pointer (planchette) corresponds to Langevin MCMC sampling from the sum of individual energy landscapes, representing fused collective knowledge. Simulations validate that CoCre-Sam dynamics effectively fuse different models and generate meaningful character sequences, while ablation studies confirm the essential roles of collective interaction and stochasticity. Altogether, CoCre-Sam provides a novel computational mechanism linking individual implicit knowledge, embodied collective action, and emergent linguistic phenomena, grounding these complex interactions in the principles of probabilistic sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compress Any Segment Anything Model (SAM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08765v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing. Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning, distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model, and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio, post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished within 60 seconds for all models.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 tables, 8 figures</p></details> |

The recent segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated strong adaptability across diverse natural scenarios. However, the huge computational costs, demand for manual annotations as prompts and conflict-prone decoding process of SAM degrade its generalization capabilities in medical scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a modality-decoupled lightweight SAM for domain-generalized medical image segmentation, named De-LightSAM. Specifically, we first devise a lightweight domain-controllable image encoder (DC-Encoder) that produces discriminative visual features for diverse modalities. Further, we introduce the self-patch prompt generator (SP-Generator) to automatically generate high-quality dense prompt embeddings for guiding segmentation decoding. Finally, we design the query-decoupled modality decoder (QM-Decoder) that leverages a one-to-one strategy to provide an independent decoding channel for every modality, preventing mutual knowledge interference of different modalities. Moreover, we design a multi-modal decoupled knowledge distillation (MDKD) strategy to leverage robust common knowledge to complement domain-specific medical feature representations. Extensive experiments indicate that De-LightSAM outperforms state-of-the-arts in diverse medical imaging segmentation tasks, displaying superior modality universality and generalization capabilities. Especially, De-LightSAM uses only 2.0% parameters compared to SAM-H. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/De-LightSAM.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, 2D specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy, non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18 backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment.

However, accurately segmenting vessels remains challenging due to their small size, intricate edge structures, and susceptibility to artifacts and imaging noise. In this work, we propose VesselSAM, an enhanced version of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), specifically tailored for aortic vessel segmentation. VesselSAM incorporates AtrousLoRA, a novel module integrating Atrous Attention and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance segmentation performance. Atrous Attention enables the model to capture multi-scale contextual information, preserving both fine-grained local details and broader global context. Additionally, LoRA facilitates efficient fine-tuning of the frozen SAM image encoder, reducing the number of trainable parameters and thereby enhancing computational efficiency. We evaluate VesselSAM using two challenging datasets: the Aortic Vessel Tree (AVT) dataset and the Type-B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) dataset. VesselSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining DSC scores of 93.50\%, 93.25\%, 93.02\%, and 93.26\% across multi-center datasets. Our results demonstrate that VesselSAM delivers high segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to existing large-scale models. This development paves the way for enhanced AI-based aortic vessel segmentation in clinical environments. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/Adnan-CAS/AtrousLora.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is appealing as it can deal with privacy concerns and access constraints on source-domain data during adaptation to target-domain data. However, SFDA faces challenges such as insufficient supervision in the target domain with unlabeled images. In this work, we propose a Segment Anything Model (SAM)-guided Reliable Pseudo-Labels method for SFDA (SRPL-SFDA) with three key components: 1) Test-Time Tri-branch Intensity Enhancement (T3IE) that not only improves quality of raw pseudo-labels in the target domain, but also leads to SAM-compatible inputs with three channels to better leverage SAM's zero-shot inference ability for refining the pseudo-labels; 2) A reliable pseudo-label selection module that rejects low-quality pseudo-labels based on Consistency of Multiple SAM Outputs (CMSO) under input perturbations with T3IE; and 3) A reliability-aware training procedure in the unlabeled target domain where reliable pseudo-labels are used for supervision and unreliable parts are regularized by entropy minimization. Experiments conducted on two multi-domain medical image segmentation datasets for fetal brain and the prostate respectively demonstrate that: 1) SRPL-SFDA effectively enhances pseudo-label quality in the unlabeled target domain, and improves SFDA performance by leveraging the reliability-aware training; 2) SRPL-SFDA outperformed state-of-the-art SFDA methods, and its performance is close to that of supervised training in the target domain. The code of this work is available online: https://github.com/HiLab-git/SRPL-SFDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures.

| **[SAM-aware Test-time Adaptation for Universal Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05221v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains. Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs. ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1) Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image segmentation.

Current monitoring methods involve ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2) temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM) information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations. We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree crown instance segmentation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Self-Prompting SAM: A Prompt-Free Medical Image Segmentation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02854v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is highly effective in natural image segmentation, it requires dependencies on prompts, which limits its applicability to medical imaging where manual prompts are often unavailable. Existing efforts to fine-tune SAM for medical segmentation typically struggle to remove this dependency. We propose Hierarchical Self-Prompting SAM (HSP-SAM), a novel self-prompting framework that enables SAM to achieve strong performance in prompt-free medical image segmentation. Unlike previous self-prompting methods that remain limited to positional prompts similar to vanilla SAM, we are the first to introduce learning abstract prompts during the self-prompting process. This simple and intuitive self-prompting framework achieves superior performance on classic segmentation tasks such as polyp and skin lesion segmentation, while maintaining robustness across diverse medical imaging modalities. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization to unseen datasets, achieving improvements of up to 14.04% over previous state-of-the-art methods on some challenging benchmarks. These results suggest that abstract prompts encapsulate richer and higher-dimensional semantic information compared to positional prompts, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and generalization performance. All models and codes will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, extending these capabilities to videos presents substantial challenges, particularly in ensuring precise and temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. SAM 2 attempts to address this by training a model on massive image and video data from scratch to learn complex spatiotemporal associations, resulting in huge training costs that hinder research and practical deployment. In this paper, we introduce SAM-I2V, an effective image-to-video upgradation method for cultivating a promptable video segmentation (PVS) model. Our approach strategically upgrades the pre-trained SAM to support PVS, significantly reducing training complexity and resource requirements. To achieve this, we introduce three key innovations: (i) an image-to-video feature extraction upgrader built upon SAM's static image encoder to enable spatiotemporal video perception, (ii) a memory filtering strategy that selects the most relevant past frames for more effective utilization of historical information, and (iii) a memory-as-prompt mechanism leveraging object memory to ensure temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves over 90% of SAM 2's performance while using only 0.2% of its training cost. Our work presents a resource-efficient pathway to PVS, lowering barriers for further research in PVS model design and enabling broader applications and advancements in the field.

To address this problem, semantic segmentation methods based on semi-supervised learning with a small number of labeled data have been proposed. For example, one approach is to train a semantic segmentation model using images with annotated labels and pseudo labels. In this approach, the accuracy of the semantic segmentation model depends on the quality of the pseudo labels, and the quality of the pseudo labels depends on the performance of the model to be trained and the amount of data with annotated labels. In this paper, we generate pseudo labels using zero-shot annotation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels using the Unified Dual-Stream Perturbations Approach (UniMatch), and use them as enhanced labels to train a semantic segmentation model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through the experiments using the public datasets: PASCAL and MS COCO.

However, existing approaches typically rely heavily on manually annotated datasets that include explicit reasoning processes, which are costly and time-consuming to produce. Recent advances suggest that reinforcement learning (RL) can endow large models with reasoning capabilities without requiring such reasoning-annotated data. In this paper, we propose SAM-R1, a novel framework that enables multimodal large models to perform fine-grained reasoning in image understanding tasks. Our approach is the first to incorporate fine-grained segmentation settings during the training of multimodal reasoning models. By integrating task-specific, fine-grained rewards with a tailored optimization objective, we further enhance the model's reasoning and segmentation alignment. We also leverage the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a strong and flexible reward provider to guide the learning process. With only 3k training samples, SAM-R1 achieves strong performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in equipping multimodal models with segmentation-oriented reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

In urology, manual segmentation is considered tedious and impractical due to the typically large scale of image databases and the continuous generation of new data. In this study, the potential of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) -- a state-of-the-art deep learning framework -- is investigated for the automation of kidney stone segmentation. The performance of SAM is evaluated in comparison to traditional models, including U-Net, Residual U-Net, and Attention U-Net, which, despite their efficiency, frequently exhibit limitations in generalizing to unseen datasets. The findings highlight SAM's superior adaptability and efficiency. While SAM achieves comparable performance to U-Net on in-distribution data (Accuracy: 97.68 + 3.04; Dice: 97.78 + 2.47; IoU: 95.76 + 4.18), it demonstrates significantly enhanced generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution data, surpassing all U-Net variants by margins of up to 23 percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, conference, MIUA25</p></details> |
| **[Auto-Prompting SAM for Weakly Supervised Landslide Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13426v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised landslide extraction aims to identify landslide regions from remote sensing data using models trained with weak labels, particularly image-level labels. However, it is often challenged by the imprecise boundaries of the extracted objects due to the lack of pixel-wise supervision and the properties of landslide objects. To tackle these issues, we propose a simple yet effective method by auto-prompting the Segment Anything Model (SAM), i.e., APSAM. Instead of depending on high-quality class activation maps (CAMs) for pseudo-labeling or fine-tuning SAM, our method directly yields fine-grained segmentation masks from SAM inference through prompt engineering. Specifically, it adaptively generates hybrid prompts from the CAMs obtained by an object localization network. To provide sufficient information for SAM prompting, an adaptive prompt generation (APG) algorithm is designed to fully leverage the visual patterns of CAMs, enabling the efficient generation of pseudo-masks for landslide extraction. These informative prompts are able to identify the extent of landslide areas (box prompts) and denote the centers of landslide objects (point prompts), guiding SAM in landslide segmentation. Experimental results on high-resolution aerial and satellite datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving improvements of at least 3.0\% in F1 score and 3.69\% in IoU compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

A critical challenge arises from the domain gap between natural images and medical volumes: existing FMs, pre-trained on 2D data, struggle to capture 3D anatomical context, limiting their utility in clinical applications like tumor segmentation. To address this, we propose an adaptation framework called TAGS: Tumor Adaptive Guidance for SAM, which unlocks 2D FMs for 3D medical tasks through multi-prompt fusion. By preserving most of the pre-trained weights, our approach enhances SAM's spatial feature extraction using CLIP's semantic insights and anatomy-specific prompts. Extensive experiments on three open-source tumor segmentation datasets prove that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models (+46.88% over nnUNet), interactive segmentation frameworks, and other established medical FMs, including SAM-Med2D, SAM-Med3D, SegVol, Universal, 3D-Adapter, and SAM-B (at least +13% over them). This highlights the robustness and adaptability of our proposed framework across diverse medical segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking the Power of SAM 2 for Few-Shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14100v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) aims to learn class-agnostic segmentation on few classes to segment arbitrary classes, but at the risk of overfitting. To address this, some methods use the well-learned knowledge of foundation models (e.g., SAM) to simplify the learning process. Recently, SAM 2 has extended SAM by supporting video segmentation, whose class-agnostic matching ability is useful to FSS. A simple idea is to encode support foreground (FG) features as memory, with which query FG features are matched and fused. Unfortunately, the FG objects in different frames of SAM 2's video data are always the same identity, while those in FSS are different identities, i.e., the matching step is incompatible. Therefore, we design Pseudo Prompt Generator to encode pseudo query memory, matching with query features in a compatible way. However, the memories can never be as accurate as the real ones, i.e., they are likely to contain incomplete query FG, and some unexpected query background (BG) features, leading to wrong segmentation. Hence, we further design Iterative Memory Refinement to fuse more query FG features into the memory, and devise a Support-Calibrated Memory Attention to suppress the unexpected query BG features in memory. Extensive experiments have been conducted on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ to validate the effectiveness of our design, e.g., the 1-shot mIoU can be 4.2% better than the best baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICML'25</p></details> |

While SAMs (SAM and SAM 2) have demonstrated excellent performance in segmenting context-independent concepts like people, cars, and roads, they overlook more challenging context-dependent (CD) concepts, such as visual saliency, camouflage, product defects, and medical lesions. CD concepts rely heavily on global and local contextual information, making them susceptible to shifts in different contexts, which requires strong discriminative capabilities from the model. The lack of comprehensive evaluation of SAMs limits understanding of their performance boundaries, which may hinder the design of future models. In this paper, we conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation of SAMs on 11 CD concepts across 2D and 3D images and videos in various visual modalities within natural, medical, and industrial scenes. We develop a unified evaluation framework for SAM and SAM 2 that supports manual, automatic, and intermediate self-prompting, aided by our specific prompt generation and interaction strategies. We further explore the potential of SAM 2 for in-context learning and introduce prompt robustness testing to simulate real-world imperfect prompts. Finally, we analyze the benefits and limitations of SAMs in understanding CD concepts and discuss their future development in segmentation tasks. This work aims to provide valuable insights to guide future research in both context-independent and context-dependent concepts segmentation, potentially informing the development of the next version -- SAM 3.</p></details> |  |

Correspondingly, this study tackles Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The previous studies declared that SAM is not workable for COD but this study reveals that SAM works if promoted properly, for which we devise a new framework to render point promotions: First, we develop the Promotion Point Targeting Network (PPT-net) to leverage multi-scale features in predicting the probabilities of camouflaged objects' presences at given candidate points over the image. Then, we develop a key point selection (KPS) algorithm to deploy both positive and negative point promotions contrastively to SAM to guide the segmentation. It is the first work to facilitate big model for COD and achieves plausible results experimentally over the existing methods on 3 data sets under 6 metrics. This study demonstrates an off-the-shelf methodology for COD by leveraging SAM, which gains advantage over designing professional models from scratch, not only in performance, but also in turning the problem to a less challenging task, that is, seeking informative but not exactly precise promotions.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we propose Proxy Prompt (PP), auto-generated by leveraging non-target data with a pre-annotated mask. We devise a novel 3-step context-selection strategy for adaptively selecting the most representative contextual information from non-target data via vision mamba and selective maps, empowering the guiding capability of non-target image-mask pairs for segmentation on target image/video data. To reinforce human-model interactions in PP, we further propose a contextual colorization module via a dual-reverse cross-attention to enhance interactions between target features and contextual-embedding with amplifying distinctive features of user-defined object(s). Via extensive evaluations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and yields comparable results with fully-trained models, even when trained with only 16 image masks.</p></details> |  |

Current studies focus on the Class Activation Map (CAM) of CNN and the self-attention map of transformer to identify the region of objects. However, both CAM and self-attention maps can not learn pixel-level fine-grained information on the foreground objects, which hinders the further advance of WSOL. To address this problem, we initiatively leverage the capability of zero-shot generalization and fine-grained segmentation in Segment Anything Model (SAM) to boost the activation of integral object regions. Further, to alleviate the semantic ambiguity issue accrued in single point prompt-based SAM, we propose an innovative mask prompt to SAM (Pro2SAM) network with grid points for WSOL task. First, we devise a Global Token Transformer (GTFormer) to generate a coarse-grained foreground map as a flexible mask prompt, where the GTFormer jointly embeds patch tokens and novel global tokens to learn foreground semantics. Secondly, we deliver grid points as dense prompts into SAM to maximize the probability of foreground mask, which avoids the lack of objects caused by a single point/box prompt. Finally, we propose a pixel-level similarity metric to come true the mask matching from mask prompt to SAM, where the mask with the highest score is viewed as the final localization map. Experiments show that the proposed Pro2SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC, with 84.03\% and 66.85\% Top-1 Loc, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Recent advancements in foundation models for video object segmentation, such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), offer a potential opportunity to significantly speed up the annotation process by manually annotating one or a few slices and then propagating target masks across the entire volume. However, the performance of SAM 2 in this context varies. Our experiments show that relying on a single memory bank and attention module is prone to error propagation, particularly at boundary regions where the target is present in the previous slice but absent in the current one. To address this problem, we propose Short-Long Memory SAM 2 (SLM-SAM 2), a novel architecture that integrates distinct short-term and long-term memory banks with separate attention modules to improve segmentation accuracy. We evaluate SLM-SAM 2 on three public datasets covering organs, bones, and muscles across MRI and CT modalities. We show that the proposed method markedly outperforms the default SAM 2, achieving average Dice Similarity Coefficient improvement of 0.14 and 0.11 in the scenarios when 5 volumes and 1 volume are available for the initial adaptation, respectively. SLM-SAM 2 also exhibits stronger resistance to over-propagation, making a notable step toward more accurate automated annotation of medical images for segmentation model development.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces SAM-TIFF, a novel teacher-student distillation framework for pixel-level wildfire temperature prediction and segmentation using RGB input only. A multimodal teacher network trained on paired RGB-Thermal imagery and radiometric TIFF ground truth distills knowledge to a unimodal RGB student network, enabling thermal-sensor-free inference.

| **[IMDPrompter: Adapting SAM to Image Manipulation Detection by Cross-View Automated Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02454v4)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using extensive training data from SA-1B, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated exceptional generalization and zero-shot capabilities, attracting widespread attention in areas such as medical image segmentation and remote sensing image segmentation. However, its performance in the field of image manipulation detection remains largely unexplored and unconfirmed. There are two main challenges in applying SAM to image manipulation detection: a) reliance on manual prompts, and b) the difficulty of single-view information in supporting cross-dataset generalization. To address these challenges, we develops a cross-view prompt learning paradigm called IMDPrompter based on SAM. Benefiting from the design of automated prompts, IMDPrompter no longer relies on manual guidance, enabling automated detection and localization. Additionally, we propose components such as Cross-view Feature Perception, Optimal Prompt Selection, and Cross-View Prompt Consistency, which facilitate cross-view perceptual learning and guide SAM to generate accurate masks. Extensive experimental results from five datasets (CASIA, Columbia, Coverage, IMD2020, and NIST16) validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAM-Guided Robust Representation Learning for One-Shot 3D Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20501v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-shot medical image segmentation (MIS) is crucial for medical analysis due to the burden of medical experts on manual annotation. The recent emergence of the segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable adaptation in MIS but cannot be directly applied to one-shot medical image segmentation (MIS) due to its reliance on labor-intensive user interactions and the high computational cost. To cope with these limitations, we propose a novel SAM-guided robust representation learning framework, named RRL-MedSAM, to adapt SAM to one-shot 3D MIS, which exploits the strong generalization capabilities of the SAM encoder to learn better feature representation. We devise a dual-stage knowledge distillation (DSKD) strategy to distill general knowledge between natural and medical images from the foundation model to train a lightweight encoder, and then adopt a mutual exponential moving average (mutual-EMA) to update the weights of the general lightweight encoder and medical-specific encoder. Specifically, pseudo labels from the registration network are used to perform mutual supervision for such two encoders. Moreover, we introduce an auto-prompting (AP) segmentation decoder which adopts the mask generated from the general lightweight model as a prompt to assist the medical-specific model in boosting the final segmentation performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets, i.e., OASIS, CT-lung demonstrate that the proposed RRL-MedSAM outperforms state-of-the-art one-shot MIS methods for both segmentation and registration tasks. Especially, our lightweight encoder uses only 3\% of the parameters compared to the encoder of SAM-Base.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Tuning SAM: From Generalist to Specialist with only 2048 Parameters and 16 Training Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16739v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is widely used for segmenting a diverse range of objects in natural images from simple user prompts like points or bounding boxes. However, SAM's performance decreases substantially when applied to non-natural domains like microscopic imaging. Furthermore, due to SAM's interactive design, it requires a precise prompt for each image and object, which is unfeasible in many automated biomedical applications. Previous solutions adapt SAM by training millions of parameters via fine-tuning large parts of the model or of adapter layers. In contrast, we show that as little as 2,048 additional parameters are sufficient for turning SAM into a use-case specialist for a certain downstream task. Our novel PTSAM (prompt-tuned SAM) method uses prompt-tuning, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, to adapt SAM for a specific task. We validate the performance of our approach on multiple microscopic and one medical dataset. Our results show that prompt-tuning only SAM's mask decoder already leads to a performance on-par with state-of-the-art techniques while requiring roughly 2,000x less trainable parameters. For addressing domain gaps, we find that additionally prompt-tuning SAM's image encoder is beneficial, further improving segmentation accuracy by up to 18% over state-of-the-art results. Since PTSAM can be reliably trained with as little as 16 annotated images, we find it particularly helpful for applications with limited training data and domain shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable Adversarial Attacks on SAM and Its Downstream Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20197v3)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The utilization of large foundational models has a dilemma: while fine-tuning downstream tasks from them holds promise for making use of the well-generalized knowledge in practical applications, their open accessibility also poses threats of adverse usage. This paper, for the first time, explores the feasibility of adversarial attacking various downstream models fine-tuned from the segment anything model (SAM), by solely utilizing the information from the open-sourced SAM. In contrast to prevailing transfer-based adversarial attacks, we demonstrate the existence of adversarial dangers even without accessing the downstream task and dataset to train a similar surrogate model. To enhance the effectiveness of the adversarial attack towards models fine-tuned on unknown datasets, we propose a universal meta-initialization (UMI) algorithm to extract the intrinsic vulnerability inherent in the foundation model, which is then utilized as the prior knowledge to guide the generation of adversarial perturbations. Moreover, by formulating the gradient difference in the attacking process between the open-sourced SAM and its fine-tuned downstream models, we theoretically demonstrate that a deviation occurs in the adversarial update direction by directly maximizing the distance of encoded feature embeddings in the open-sourced SAM. Consequently, we propose a gradient robust loss that simulates the associated uncertainty with gradient-based noise augmentation to enhance the robustness of generated adversarial examples (AEs) towards this deviation, thus improving the transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed universal meta-initialized and gradient robust adversarial attack (UMI-GRAT) toward SAMs and their downstream models.

| **[SAUGE: Taming SAM for Uncertainty-Aligned Multi-Granularity Edge Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12892v3)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge labels are typically at various granularity levels owing to the varying preferences of annotators, thus handling the subjectivity of per-pixel labels has been a focal point for edge detection. Previous methods often employ a simple voting strategy to diminish such label uncertainty or impose a strong assumption of labels with a pre-defined distribution, e.g., Gaussian. In this work, we unveil that the segment anything model (SAM) provides strong prior knowledge to model the uncertainty in edge labels. Our key insight is that the intermediate SAM features inherently correspond to object edges at various granularities, which reflects different edge options due to uncertainty. Therefore, we attempt to align uncertainty with granularity by regressing intermediate SAM features from different layers to object edges at multi-granularity levels. In doing so, the model can fully and explicitly explore diverse ``uncertainties'' in a data-driven fashion. Specifically, we inject a lightweight module (~ 1.5% additional parameters) into the frozen SAM to progressively fuse and adapt its intermediate features to estimate edges from coarse to fine. It is crucial to normalize the granularity level of human edge labels to match their innate uncertainty. For this, we simply perform linear blending to the real edge labels at hand to create pseudo labels with varying granularities. Consequently, our uncertainty-aligned edge detector can flexibly produce edges at any desired granularity (including an optimal one). Thanks to SAM, our model uniquely demonstrates strong generalizability for cross-dataset edge detection. Extensive experimental results on BSDS500, Muticue and NYUDv2 validate our model's superiority.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[SAM-Based Building Change Detection with Distribution-Aware Fourier Adaptation and Edge-Constrained Warping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12619v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building change detection remains challenging for urban development, disaster assessment, and military reconnaissance. While foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) show strong segmentation capabilities, SAM is limited in the task of building change detection due to domain gap issues. Existing adapter-based fine-tuning approaches face challenges with imbalanced building distribution, resulting in poor detection of subtle changes and inaccurate edge extraction. Additionally, bi-temporal misalignment in change detection, typically addressed by optical flow, remains vulnerable to background noises. This affects the detection of building changes and compromises both detection accuracy and edge recognition. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new SAM-Based Network with Distribution-Aware Fourier Adaptation and Edge-Constrained Warping (FAEWNet) for building change detection. FAEWNet utilizes the SAM encoder to extract rich visual features from remote sensing images. To guide SAM in focusing on specific ground objects in remote sensing scenes, we propose a Distribution-Aware Fourier Aggregated Adapter to aggregate task-oriented changed information. This adapter not only effectively addresses the domain gap issue, but also pays attention to the distribution of changed buildings. Furthermore, to mitigate noise interference and misalignment in height offset estimation, we design a novel flow module that refines building edge extraction and enhances the perception of changed buildings. Our state-of-the-art results on the LEVIR-CD, S2Looking and WHU-CD datasets highlight the effectiveness of FAEWNet. The code is available at https://github.com/SUPERMAN123000/FAEWNet.</p></details> |  |

One promising strategy for SDG is to leverage consistent semantic shape priors across different imaging protocols, scanner vendors, and clinical sites. However, existing dictionary learning methods that encode shape priors often suffer from limited representational power with a small set of offline computed shape elements, or overfitting when the dictionary size grows. Moreover, they are not readily compatible with large foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM). In this paper, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Shape-Experts (MoSE) framework that seamlessly integrates the idea of mixture-of-experts (MoE) training into dictionary learning to efficiently capture diverse and robust shape priors. Our method conceptualizes each dictionary atom as a shape expert, which specializes in encoding distinct semantic shape information. A gating network dynamically fuses these shape experts into a robust shape map, with sparse activation guided by SAM encoding to prevent overfitting. We further provide this shape map as a prompt to SAM, utilizing the powerful generalization capability of SAM through bidirectional integration. All modules, including the shape dictionary, are trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 workshop</p></details> |

This paper presents SAM-CP, a simple approach that establishes two types of composable prompts beyond SAM and composes them for versatile segmentation. Specifically, given a set of classes (in texts) and a set of SAM patches, the Type-I prompt judges whether a SAM patch aligns with a text label, and the Type-II prompt judges whether two SAM patches with the same text label also belong to the same instance. To decrease the complexity in dealing with a large number of semantic classes and patches, we establish a unified framework that calculates the affinity between (semantic and instance) queries and SAM patches and merges patches with high affinity to the query. Experiments show that SAM-CP achieves semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation in both open and closed domains. In particular, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary segmentation. Our research offers a novel and generalized methodology for equipping vision foundation models like SAM with multi-grained semantic perception abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025; codes:https://github.com/ucas-vg/SAM-CP</p></details> |

Open-vocabulary image Segmentation addresses these generalization issues in traditional supervised segmentation models while reducing reliance on extensive per-pixel annotations, which are both expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. Most Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) methods are designed for natural images but struggle with remote sensing data due to scale variations, orientation changes, and complex scene compositions. This necessitates the development of OVS approaches specifically tailored for remote sensing. In this context, we propose AerOSeg, a novel OVS approach for remote sensing data. First, we compute robust image-text correlation features using multiple rotated versions of the input image and domain-specific prompts. These features are then refined through spatial and class refinement blocks. Inspired by the success of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in diverse domains, we leverage SAM features to guide the spatial refinement of correlation features. Additionally, we introduce a semantic back-projection module and loss to ensure the seamless propagation of SAM's semantic information throughout the segmentation pipeline. Finally, we enhance the refined correlation features using a multi-scale attention-aware decoder to produce the final segmentation map. We validate our SAM-guided Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Segmentation model on three benchmark remote sensing datasets: iSAID, DLRSD, and OpenEarthMap. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.54 h-mIoU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EarthVision workshop, CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Robust SAM: On the Adversarial Robustness of Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08906v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a widely used vision foundation model with diverse applications, including image segmentation, detection, and tracking. Given SAM's wide applications, understanding its robustness against adversarial attacks is crucial for real-world deployment. However, research on SAM's robustness is still in its early stages. Existing attacks often overlook the role of prompts in evaluating SAM's robustness, and there has been insufficient exploration of defense methods to balance the robustness and accuracy. To address these gaps, this paper proposes an adversarial robustness framework designed to evaluate and enhance the robustness of SAM. Specifically, we introduce a cross-prompt attack method to enhance the attack transferability across different prompt types. Besides attacking, we propose a few-parameter adaptation strategy to defend SAM against various adversarial attacks. To balance robustness and accuracy, we use the singular value decomposition (SVD) to constrain the space of trainable parameters, where only singular values are adaptable. Experiments demonstrate that our cross-prompt attack method outperforms previous approaches in terms of attack success rate on both SAM and SAM 2. By adapting only 512 parameters, we achieve at least a 15\% improvement in mean intersection over union (mIoU) against various adversarial attacks. Compared to previous defense methods, our approach enhances the robustness of SAM while maximally maintaining its original performance.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |
| **[S^4M: Boosting Semi-Supervised Instance Segmentation with SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05301v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised instance segmentation poses challenges due to limited labeled data, causing difficulties in accurately localizing distinct object instances. Current teacher-student frameworks still suffer from performance constraints due to unreliable pseudo-label quality stemming from limited labeled data. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers robust segmentation capabilities at various granularities, directly applying SAM to this task introduces challenges such as class-agnostic predictions and potential over-segmentation. To address these complexities, we carefully integrate SAM into the semi-supervised instance segmentation framework, developing a novel distillation method that effectively captures the precise localization capabilities of SAM without compromising semantic recognition. Furthermore, we incorporate pseudo-label refinement as well as a specialized data augmentation with the refined pseudo-labels, resulting in superior performance. We establish state-of-the-art performance, and provide comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[CMaP-SAM: Contraction Mapping Prior for SAM-driven Few-shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05049v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment new classes using few annotated images. While recent FSS methods have shown considerable improvements by leveraging Segment Anything Model (SAM), they face two critical limitations: insufficient utilization of structural correlations in query images, and significant information loss when converting continuous position priors to discrete point prompts. To address these challenges, we propose CMaP-SAM, a novel framework that introduces contraction mapping theory to optimize position priors for SAM-driven few-shot segmentation. CMaP-SAM consists of three key components: (1) a contraction mapping module that formulates position prior optimization as a Banach contraction mapping with convergence guarantees. This module iteratively refines position priors through pixel-wise structural similarity, generating a converged prior that preserves both semantic guidance from reference images and structural correlations in query images; (2) an adaptive distribution alignment module bridging continuous priors with SAM's binary mask prompt encoder; and (3) a foreground-background decoupled refinement architecture producing accurate final segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate CMaP-SAM's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 71.1 mIoU on PASCAL-$5^i$ and 56.1 on COCO-$20^i$ datasets.</p></details> | 7 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose U-SAM, a novel framework that imbibes semantic awareness into SAM, enabling it to generate targeted masks for user-specified object categories. Given only object class names as input from the user, U-SAM provides pixel-level semantic annotations for images without requiring any labeled/unlabeled samples from the test data distribution. Our approach leverages synthetically generated or web crawled images to accumulate semantic information about the desired object classes. We then learn a mapping function between SAM's mask embeddings and object class labels, effectively enhancing SAM with granularity-specific semantic recognition capabilities. As a result, users can obtain meaningful and targeted segmentation masks for specific objects they request, rather than generic and unlabeled masks. We evaluate U-SAM on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MSCOCO-80, achieving significant mIoU improvements of +17.95% and +5.20%, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods. By transforming SAM into a semantically aware segmentation model, U-SAM offers a practical and flexible solution for pixel-level annotation across diverse and unseen domains in a resource-constrained environment.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches in image manipulation detection have largely been driven by fully supervised approaches, which require labor-intensive pixel-level annotations. Thus, it is essential to explore weakly supervised image manipulation localization methods that only require image-level binary labels for training. However, existing weakly supervised image manipulation methods overlook the importance of edge information for accurate localization, leading to suboptimal localization performance. To address this, we propose a Context-Aware Boundary Localization (CABL) module to aggregate boundary features and learn context-inconsistency for localizing manipulated areas. Furthermore, by leveraging Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and Segment Anything Model (SAM), we introduce the CAM-Guided SAM Refinement (CGSR) module to generate more accurate manipulation localization maps. By integrating two modules, we present a novel weakly supervised framework based on a dual-branch Transformer-CNN architecture. Our method achieves outstanding localization performance across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods address this by sequentially connecting a powerful mask proposal generator, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP. But these two-stage approaches often suffer from high computational costs, memory inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose ESC-Net, a novel one-stage open-vocabulary segmentation model that leverages the SAM decoder blocks for class-agnostic segmentation within an efficient inference framework. By embedding pseudo prompts generated from image-text correlations into SAM's promptable segmentation framework, ESC-Net achieves refined spatial aggregation for accurate mask predictions. ESC-Net achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks, including ADE20K, PASCAL-VOC, and PASCAL-Context, outperforming prior methods in both efficiency and accuracy.

However, although SAM excels in fine-grained segmentation, it faces major challenges when applying it to semantic-aware segmentation. While CLIP exhibits a strong semantic understanding capability via aligning the global features of language and vision, it has deficiencies in fine-grained segmentation tasks. Human parsing requires to segment human bodies into constituent parts and involves both accurate fine-grained segmentation and high semantic understanding of each part. Based on traits of SAM and CLIP, we formulate high efficient modules to effectively integrate features of them to benefit human parsing. We propose a Semantic-Refinement Module to integrate semantic features of CLIP with SAM features to benefit parsing. Moreover, we formulate a high efficient Fine-tuning Module to adjust the pretrained SAM for human parsing that needs high semantic information and simultaneously demands spatial details, which significantly reduces the training time compared with full-time training and achieves notable performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on LIP, PPP, and CIHP databases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving SAM for Camouflaged Object Detection via Dual Stream Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06042v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment anything model (SAM) has shown impressive general-purpose segmentation performance on natural images, but its performance on camouflaged object detection (COD) is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose SAM-COD that performs camouflaged object detection for RGB-D inputs. While keeping the SAM architecture intact, dual stream adapters are expanded on the image encoder to learn potential complementary information from RGB images and depth images, and fine-tune the mask decoder and its depth replica to perform dual-stream mask prediction. In practice, the dual stream adapters are embedded into the attention block of the image encoder in a parallel manner to facilitate the refinement and correction of the two types of image embeddings. To mitigate channel discrepancies arising from dual stream embeddings that do not directly interact with each other, we augment the association of dual stream embeddings using bidirectional knowledge distillation including a model distiller and a modal distiller. In addition, to predict the masks for RGB and depth attention maps, we hybridize the two types of image embeddings which are jointly learned with the prompt embeddings to update the initial prompt, and then feed them into the mask decoders to synchronize the consistency of image embeddings and prompt embeddings. Experimental results on four COD benchmarks show that our SAM-COD achieves excellent detection performance gains over SAM and achieves state-of-the-art results with a given fine-tuning paradigm.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods address this issue through modality fusion, integrating textual and image information to provide more detailed priors. In this study, we argue that the granularity of text and the domain gap affect the accuracy of the priors. Furthermore, the discrepancy between high-level abstract semantics and pixel-level boundary details in images can introduce noise into the fusion process. To address this, we propose Prior-Guided SAM (PG-SAM), which employs a fine-grained modality prior aligner to leverage specialized medical knowledge for better modality alignment. The core of our method lies in efficiently addressing the domain gap with fine-grained text from a medical LLM. Meanwhile, it also enhances the priors' quality after modality alignment, ensuring more accurate segmentation. In addition, our decoder enhances the model's expressive capabilities through multi-level feature fusion and iterative mask optimizer operations, supporting unprompted learning. We also propose a unified pipeline that effectively supplies high-quality semantic information to SAM. Extensive experiments on the Synapse dataset demonstrate that the proposed PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping and characterizing trees from aerial imagery, and large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), may be a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare SAM methods for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery of young tree plantations. We explore the potential of SAM for this task, and find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts, but that there is potential for methods which tune SAM further.

Although early research prioritized visual quality, preserving fine details and adapting to downstream tasks remains challenging. Recent approaches attempt task-specific design but rarely achieve "The Best of Both Worlds" due to inconsistent optimization goals. To address these issues, we propose a novel method that leverages the semantic knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to Grow the quality of fusion results and Enable downstream task adaptability, namely SAGE. Specifically, we design a Semantic Persistent Attention (SPA) Module that efficiently maintains source information via the persistent repository while extracting high-level semantic priors from SAM. More importantly, to eliminate the impractical dependence on SAM during inference, we introduce a bi-level optimization-driven distillation mechanism with triplet losses, which allow the student network to effectively extract knowledge.

However, SAM does not work when directly applied to medical image segmentation, since SAM lacks the ability to predict semantic labels, requires additional prompts, and presents suboptimal performance. Following the above issues, we propose MaskSAM, a novel mask classification prompt-free SAM adaptation framework for medical image segmentation. We design a prompt generator combined with the image encoder in SAM to generate a set of auxiliary classifier tokens, auxiliary binary masks, and auxiliary bounding boxes. Each pair of auxiliary mask and box prompts can solve the requirements of extra prompts. The semantic label prediction can be addressed by the sum of the auxiliary classifier tokens and the learnable global classifier tokens in the mask decoder of SAM. Meanwhile, we design a 3D depth-convolution adapter for image embeddings and a 3D depth-MLP adapter for prompt embeddings to efficiently fine-tune SAM. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AMOS2022, 90.52% Dice, which improved by 2.7% compared to nnUNet.

Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has shown superior advancements in image and video segmentation. However, SAM2 struggles with efficiency due to the high computational demands of processing high-resolution images and complex and long-range temporal dynamics in surgical videos. To address these challenges, we introduce Surgical SAM 2 (SurgSAM2), an advanced model to utilize SAM2 with an Efficient Frame Pruning (EFP) mechanism, to facilitate real-time surgical video segmentation. The EFP mechanism dynamically manages the memory bank by selectively retaining only the most informative frames, reducing memory usage and computational cost while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgSAM2 significantly improves both efficiency and segmentation accuracy compared to the vanilla SAM2. Remarkably, SurgSAM2 achieves a 3$\times$ FPS compared with SAM2, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance after fine-tuning with lower-resolution data. These advancements establish SurgSAM2 as a leading model for surgical video analysis, making real-time surgical video segmentation in resource-constrained environments a reality.

However, such models are supervised in nature, still relying on large annotated datasets or prompts supplied by experts. Conventional techniques such as active learning to alleviate such limitations are limited in scope and still necessitate continuous human involvement and complex domain knowledge for label refinement or establishing reward ground truth. To address these challenges, we propose an enhanced Segment Anything Model (SAM) framework that utilizes annotation-efficient prompts generated in a fully unsupervised fashion, while still capturing essential semantic, location, and shape information through contrastive language-image pretraining and visual question answering. We adopt the direct preference optimization technique to design an optimal policy that enables the model to generate high-fidelity segmentations with simple ratings or rankings provided by a virtual annotator simulating the human annotation process. State-of-the-art performance of our framework in tasks such as lung segmentation, breast tumor segmentation, and organ segmentation across various modalities, including X-ray, ultrasound, and abdominal CT, justifies its effectiveness in low-annotation data scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[WeakMedSAM: Weakly-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation via SAM with Sub-Class Exploration and Prompt Affinity Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04106v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have witnessed remarkable progress in foundation models in vision tasks. Currently, several recent works have utilized the segmenting anything model (SAM) to boost the segmentation performance in medical images, where most of them focus on training an adaptor for fine-tuning a large amount of pixel-wise annotated medical images following a fully supervised manner. In this paper, to reduce the labeling cost, we investigate a novel weakly-supervised SAM-based segmentation model, namely WeakMedSAM. Specifically, our proposed WeakMedSAM contains two modules: 1) to mitigate severe co-occurrence in medical images, a sub-class exploration module is introduced to learn accurate feature representations. 2) to improve the quality of the class activation maps, our prompt affinity mining module utilizes the prompt capability of SAM to obtain an affinity map for random-walk refinement. Our method can be applied to any SAM-like backbone, and we conduct experiments with SAMUS and EfficientSAM. The experimental results on three popularly-used benchmark datasets, i.e., BraTS 2019, AbdomenCT-1K, and MSD Cardiac dataset, show the promising results of our proposed WeakMedSAM.

However, current scribble-supervised learning methods are limited in their ability to effectively propagate sparse annotation labels to dense segmentation masks and accurately segment object boundaries. To address these issues, we propose a Progressive Collaborative Learning framework that leverages novel algorithms and the Med-SAM foundation model to enhance information quality during training. (1) We enrich ground truth scribble segmentation labels through a new algorithm, propagating scribbles to estimate object boundaries. (2) We enhance feature representation by optimizing Med-SAM-guided training through the fusion of feature embeddings from Med-SAM and our proposed Sparse Mamba network. This enriched representation also facilitates the fine-tuning of the Med-SAM decoder with enriched scribbles. (3) For inference, we introduce a Sparse Mamba network, which is highly capable of capturing local and global dependencies by replacing the traditional sequential patch processing method with a skip-sampling procedure. Experiments on the ACDC, CHAOS, and MSCMRSeg datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, outperforming nine state-of-the-art methods.

This can make the model selection process slow, non-extensive and highly subjective, while producing unrealistic looking parameter estimates with discrete jumps. We propose to model age-dependent SAM parameters using smoothing spline functions. This can lead to more smooth parameter estimates, while speeding up and making the model selection process more automatic and less subjective. We develop different spline models and compare them with already existing SAM models for a selection of 17 different fish stocks, using cross- and forward-validation methods. The results show that our automated spline models overall outcompete the officially developed SAM models. We also demonstrate how the developed spline models can be employed as a diagnostics tool for improving and better understanding properties of the officially developed SAM models.</p></details> |  |

The approach integrates two advanced AI models, CLIP and SAM, focusing on their synergistic combination and the effective use of multimodal data (image and text). Emphasis is placed on utilizing gradient-based attention mechanisms and customized datasets to fine-tune performance. While CLIP, SAM, and Grad- CAM are established components, their integration within this structured pipeline represents a significant contribution to the field. The resulting segmented masks, generated through this combined approach, can be effectively utilized as inputs for robotic systems, enabling more precise and adaptive object manipulation in the context of convenience store products.</p></details> |  |
| **[LORENZA: Enhancing Generalization in Low-Rank Gradient LLM Training via Efficient Zeroth-Order Adaptive SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19571v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study robust parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques designed to improve accuracy and generalization while operating within strict computational and memory hardware constraints, specifically focusing on large-language models (LLMs). Existing PEFT methods often lack robustness and fail to generalize effectively across diverse tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. To address this, we present a new highly computationally efficient framework called AdaZo-SAM, combining Adam and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) while requiring only a single-gradient computation in every iteration. This is achieved using a stochastic zeroth-order estimation to find SAM's ascent perturbation. We provide a convergence guarantee for AdaZo-SAM and show that it improves the generalization ability of state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Additionally, we design a low-rank gradient optimization method named LORENZA, which is a memory-efficient version of AdaZo-SAM. LORENZA utilizes a randomized SVD scheme to efficiently compute the subspace projection matrix and apply optimization steps onto the selected subspace. This technique enables full-parameter fine-tuning with adaptive low-rank gradient updates, achieving the same reduced memory consumption as gradient-low-rank-projection methods. We provide a convergence analysis of LORENZA and demonstrate its merits for pre-training and fine-tuning LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monge SAM: Robust Reparameterization-Invariant Sharpness-Aware Minimization Based on Loss Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08448v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on deep neural networks show that flat minima of the loss landscape correlate with improved generalization. Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) efficiently finds flat regions by updating the parameters according to the gradient at an adversarial perturbation. The perturbation depends on the Euclidean metric, making SAM non-invariant under reparametrizations, which blurs sharpness and generalization. We propose Monge SAM (M-SAM), a reparametrization invariant version of SAM by considering a Riemannian metric in the parameter space induced naturally by the loss surface. Compared to previous approaches, M-SAM works under any modeling choice, relies only on mild assumptions while being as computationally efficient as SAM. We theoretically argue that M-SAM varies between SAM and gradient descent (GD), which increases robustness to hyperparameter selection and reduces attraction to suboptimal equilibria like saddle points. We demonstrate this behavior both theoretically and empirically on a multi-modal representation alignment task.</p></details> |  |
| **[RFMedSAM 2: Automatic Prompt Refinement for Enhanced Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation with SAM 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02741v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), a prompt-driven foundation model extending SAM to both image and video domains, has shown superior zero-shot performance compared to its predecessor. Building on SAM's success in medical image segmentation, SAM 2 presents significant potential for further advancement. However, similar to SAM, SAM 2 is limited by its output of binary masks, inability to infer semantic labels, and dependence on precise prompts for the target object area. Additionally, direct application of SAM and SAM 2 to medical image segmentation tasks yields suboptimal results. In this paper, we explore the upper performance limit of SAM 2 using custom fine-tuning adapters, achieving a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 92.30% on the BTCV dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art nnUNet by 12%. Following this, we address the prompt dependency by investigating various prompt generators. We introduce a UNet to autonomously generate predicted masks and bounding boxes, which serve as input to SAM 2. Subsequent dual-stage refinements by SAM 2 further enhance performance. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the AMOS2022 dataset, with a Dice improvement of 2.9% compared to nnUNet, and outperforms nnUNet by 6.4% on the BTCV dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Avoiding spurious sharpness minimization broadens applicability of SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02407v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvature regularization techniques like Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) have shown great promise in improving generalization on vision tasks. However, we find that SAM performs poorly in domains like natural language processing (NLP), often degrading performance -- even with twice the compute budget. We investigate the discrepancy across domains and find that in the NLP setting, SAM is dominated by regularization of the logit statistics -- instead of improving the geometry of the function itself. We use this observation to develop an alternative algorithm we call Functional-SAM, which regularizes curvature only through modification of the statistics of the overall function implemented by the neural network, and avoids spurious minimization through logit manipulation. Furthermore, we argue that preconditioning the SAM perturbation also prevents spurious minimization, and when combined with Functional-SAM, it gives further improvements. Our proposed algorithms show improved performance over AdamW and SAM baselines when trained for an equal number of steps, in both fixed-length and Chinchilla-style training settings, at various model scales (including billion-parameter scale). On the whole, our work highlights the importance of more precise characterizations of sharpness in broadening the applicability of curvature regularization to large language models (LLMs).</p></details> |  |

Given the 3D point cloud and multiple posed RGB-D frames of 3D scenes, our approach segments 3D instances by applying the pretrained Segment Anything Model (SAM) to 2D frames. Our key idea involves locating SAM prompts in 3D to align their projected pixel prompts across frames, ensuring the view consistency of SAM-predicted masks. Moreover, we suggest selecting prompts from the initial set guided by the information of SAM-predicted masks across all views, which enhances the overall performance. We further propose to consolidate different prompts if they are segmenting different surface parts of the same 3D instance, bringing a more comprehensive segmentation. Notably, our method does not require any additional training. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that our method achieves comparable or better performance compared to previous zero-shot or fully supervised approaches, and in many cases surpasses human annotations. Furthermore, since our fine-grained predictions often lack annotations in available datasets, we present ScanNet200-Fine50 test data which provides fine-grained annotations on 50 scenes from ScanNet200 dataset.

This paper presents Synthetic Anomaly Monitoring (SAM), an innovative approach that applies synthetic control methods from causal inference to improve both the accuracy and interpretability of anomaly detection processes. By modeling normal behavior through the treatment of each feature as a control unit, SAM identifies anomalies as deviations within this causal framework. We conducted extensive experiments comparing SAM with established benchmark models, including Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), across five diverse datasets, including Credit Card Fraud, HTTP Dataset CSIC 2010, and KDD Cup 1999, among others.

To effectively deploy these models in real-world scenarios, it is essential to employ cross-domain adaptation techniques that bridge the gap between training data and real-world data. Recently, self-training with pseudo-labels has emerged as a predominant method for cross-domain adaptation in multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation. However, generating reliable pseudo-labels necessitates stringent constraints, which often result in sparse pseudo-labels after pruning. This sparsity can potentially hinder performance improvement during the adaptation process. We propose an image-guided pseudo-label enhancement approach that leverages the complementary 2D prior knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to introduce more reliable pseudo-labels, thereby boosting domain adaptation performance. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and the SAM masks from its paired image data, we collect all 3D points covered by each SAM mask that potentially belong to the same object. Then our method refines the pseudo-labels within each SAM mask in two steps. First, we determine the class label for each mask using majority voting and employ various constraints to filter out unreliable mask labels. Next, we introduce Geometry-Aware Progressive Propagation (GAPP) which propagates the mask label to all 3D points within the SAM mask while avoiding outliers caused by 2D-3D misalignment. Experiments conducted across multiple datasets and domain adaptation scenarios demonstrate that our proposed method significantly increases the quantity of high-quality pseudo-labels and enhances the adaptation performance over baseline methods.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |
| **[Vision and Language Reference Prompt into SAM for Few-shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00719v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a large-scale segmentation model that enables powerful zero-shot capabilities with flexible prompts. While SAM can segment any object in zero-shot, it requires user-provided prompts for each target image and does not attach any label information to masks. Few-shot segmentation models addressed these issues by inputting annotated reference images as prompts to SAM and can segment specific objects in target images without user-provided prompts. Previous SAM-based few-shot segmentation models only use annotated reference images as prompts, resulting in limited accuracy due to a lack of reference information. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot segmentation model, Vision and Language reference Prompt into SAM (VLP-SAM), that utilizes the visual information of the reference images and the semantic information of the text labels by inputting not only images but also language as reference information. In particular, VLP-SAM is a simple and scalable structure with minimal learnable parameters, which inputs prompt embeddings with vision-language information into SAM using a multimodal vision-language model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of VLP-SAM, we conducted experiments on the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets, and achieved high performance in the few-shot segmentation task, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art model by a large margin (6.3% and 9.5% in mIoU, respectively). Furthermore, VLP-SAM demonstrates its generality in unseen objects that are not included in the training data. Our code is available at https://github.com/kosukesakurai1/VLP-SAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Self-Prompt SAM: Medical Image Segmentation via Automatic Prompt SAM Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00630v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance and brought a range of unexplored capabilities to natural image segmentation tasks. However, as a very important branch of image segmentation, the performance of SAM remains uncertain when applied to medical image segmentation due to the significant differences between natural images and medical images. Meanwhile, it is harsh to meet the SAM's requirements of extra prompts provided, such as points or boxes to specify medical regions. In this paper, we propose a novel self-prompt SAM adaptation framework for medical image segmentation, named Self-Prompt-SAM. We design a multi-scale prompt generator combined with the image encoder in SAM to generate auxiliary masks. Then, we use the auxiliary masks to generate bounding boxes as box prompts and use Distance Transform to select the most central points as point prompts. Meanwhile, we design a 3D depth-fused adapter (DfusedAdapter) and inject the DFusedAdapter into each transformer in the image encoder and mask decoder to enable pre-trained 2D SAM models to extract 3D information and adapt to 3D medical images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms nnUNet by 2.3% on AMOS2022, 1.6% on ACDCand 0.5% on Synapse datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, its significant computational requirements limit its deployment in real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel knowledge distillation approach, KD SAM, which incorporates both encoder and decoder optimization through a combination of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Perceptual Loss. This dual-loss framework captures structural and semantic features, enabling the student model to maintain high segmentation accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Based on the model evaluation on datasets, including Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2017, Fetal Head Ultrasound, and Breast Ultrasound, we demonstrate that KD SAM achieves comparable or superior performance to the baseline models, with significantly fewer parameters. KD SAM effectively balances segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for real-time medical image segmentation applications in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Unsupervised segmentation is promising to avoid human annotations while the performance is often limited. In this study, we present a novel unsupervised segmentation approach that leverages the capabilities of foundation models, and it consists of three main steps: (1) A vision-language model (i.e., CLIP) is employed to obtain image-level pseudo-labels for training a classification network. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) is then employed to extract Regions of Interest (ROIs), where an adaptive masking-based data augmentation is used to enhance ROI identification.(2) The ROIs are used to generate bounding box and point prompts for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain segmentation pseudo-labels. (3) A 3D segmentation network is trained with the SAM-derived pseudo-labels, where low-quality pseudo-labels are filtered out in a self-learning process based on the similarity between the SAM's output and the network's prediction. Evaluation on the BraTS2020 dataset demonstrates that our approach obtained an average Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 85.60%, outperforming five state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods by more than 10 percentage points. Besides, our approach outperforms directly using SAM for zero-shot inference, and its performance is close to fully supervised learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>22st ...</summary><p>22st IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2025)</p></details> |

To reduce the annotation cost and maintain satisfactory performance, in this work, we leverage the capabilities of SAM for establishing semi-supervised medical image segmentation models. Rethinking the requirements of effectiveness, efficiency, and compatibility, we propose a three-stage framework, i.e., Stitching, Fine-tuning, and Re-training (SFR). The current fine-tuning approaches mostly involve 2D slice-wise fine-tuning that disregards the contextual information between adjacent slices. Our stitching strategy mitigates the mismatch between natural and 3D medical images. The stitched images are then used for fine-tuning SAM, providing robust initialization of pseudo-labels. Afterwards, we train a 3D semi-supervised segmentation model while maintaining the same parameter size as the conventional segmenter such as V-Net. Our SFR framework is plug-and-play, and easily compatible with various popular semi-supervised methods. We also develop an extended framework SFR$^+$ with selective fine-tuning and re-training through confidence estimation. Extensive experiments validate that our SFR and SFR$^+$ achieve significant improvements in both moderate annotation and scarce annotation across five datasets. In particular, SFR framework improves the Dice score of Mean Teacher from 29.68% to 74.40% with only one labeled data of LA dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Skin Disease Diagnosis: Interpretable Visual Concept Discovery with SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09520v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current AI-assisted skin image diagnosis has achieved dermatologist-level performance in classifying skin cancer, driven by rapid advancements in deep learning architectures. However, unlike traditional vision tasks, skin images in general present unique challenges due to the limited availability of well-annotated datasets, complex variations in conditions, and the necessity for detailed interpretations to ensure patient safety. Previous segmentation methods have sought to reduce image noise and enhance diagnostic performance, but these techniques require fine-grained, pixel-level ground truth masks for training. In contrast, with the rise of foundation models, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has been introduced to facilitate promptable segmentation, enabling the automation of the segmentation process with simple yet effective prompts. Efforts applying SAM predominantly focus on dermatoscopy images, which present more easily identifiable lesion boundaries than clinical photos taken with smartphones. This limitation constrains the practicality of these approaches to real-world applications. To overcome the challenges posed by noisy clinical photos acquired via non-standardized protocols and to improve diagnostic accessibility, we propose a novel Cross-Attentive Fusion framework for interpretable skin lesion diagnosis. Our method leverages SAM to generate visual concepts for skin diseases using prompts, integrating local visual concepts with global image features to enhance model performance. Extensive evaluation on two skin disease datasets demonstrates our proposed method's effectiveness on lesion diagnosis and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by WACV 2025</p></details> |

In contrast to traditional NAS methods, recently proposed one-shot NAS methods prove to be more efficient in performing NAS. One-shot NAS works by generating a singular weight-sharing supernetwork that acts as a search space (container) of subnetworks. Despite its achievements, designing the one-shot search space remains a major challenge. In this work we propose a search space design strategy for Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architectures. In particular, we convert the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a weight-sharing supernetwork called SuperSAM. Our approach involves automating the search space design via layer-wise structured pruning and parameter prioritization. While the structured pruning applies probabilistic removal of certain transformer layers, parameter prioritization performs weight reordering and slicing of MLP-blocks in the remaining layers. We train supernetworks on several datasets using the sandwich rule. For deployment, we enhance subnetwork discovery by utilizing a program autotuner to identify efficient subnetworks within the search space. The resulting subnetworks are 30-70% smaller in size compared to the original pre-trained SAM ViT-B, yet outperform the pretrained model. Our work introduces a new and effective method for ViT NAS search-space design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided SAM: Label-Efficient Part Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07434v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localizing object parts precisely is essential for tasks such as object recognition and robotic manipulation. Recent part segmentation methods require extensive training data and labor-intensive annotations. Segment-Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated good performance on a wide range of segmentation problems, but requires (manual) positional prompts to guide it where to segment. Furthermore, since it has been trained on full objects instead of object parts, it is prone to over-segmentation of parts. To address this, we propose a novel approach that guides SAM towards the relevant object parts. Our method learns positional prompts from coarse patch annotations that are easier and cheaper to acquire. We train classifiers on image patches to identify part classes and aggregate patches into regions of interest (ROIs) with positional prompts. SAM is conditioned on these ROIs and prompts. This approach, termed `Guided SAM', enhances efficiency and reduces manual effort, allowing effective part segmentation with minimal labeled data. We demonstrate the efficacy of Guided SAM on a dataset of car parts, improving the average IoU on state of the art models from 0.37 to 0.49 with annotations that are on average five times more efficient to acquire.</p></details> |  |

However, the limited availability of enough 3D medical data restricts the generalization and robustness of most IMIS methods. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), though effective for 2D images, requires expensive semi-auto slice-by-slice annotations for 3D medical images. In this paper, we explore the zero-shot capabilities of SAM 2, the next-generation Meta SAM model trained on videos, for 3D medical image segmentation. By treating sequential 2D slices of 3D images as video frames, SAM 2 can fully automatically propagate annotations from a single frame to the entire 3D volume. We propose a practical pipeline for using SAM 2 in 3D medical image segmentation and present key findings highlighting its efficiency and potential for further optimization. Concretely, numerical experiments on the BraTS2020 and the medical segmentation decathlon datasets demonstrate that SAM 2 still has a gap with supervised methods but can narrow the gap in specific settings and organ types, significantly reducing the annotation burden on medical professionals.

| **[Region-Guided Attack on the Segment Anything Model (SAM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02974v3)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a cornerstone of image segmentation, demonstrating exceptional performance across various applications, particularly in autonomous driving and medical imaging, where precise segmentation is crucial. However, SAM is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can significantly impair its functionality through minor input perturbations. Traditional techniques, such as FGSM and PGD, are often ineffective in segmentation tasks due to their reliance on global perturbations that overlook spatial nuances. Recent methods like Attack-SAM-K and UAD have begun to address these challenges, but they frequently depend on external cues and do not fully leverage the structural interdependencies within segmentation processes. This limitation underscores the need for a novel adversarial strategy that exploits the unique characteristics of segmentation tasks. In response, we introduce the Region-Guided Attack (RGA), designed specifically for SAM. RGA utilizes a Region-Guided Map (RGM) to manipulate segmented regions, enabling targeted perturbations that fragment large segments and expand smaller ones, resulting in erroneous outputs from SAM. Our experiments demonstrate that RGA achieves high success rates in both white-box and black-box scenarios, emphasizing the need for robust defenses against such sophisticated attacks. RGA not only reveals SAM's vulnerabilities but also lays the groundwork for developing more resilient defenses against adversarial threats in image segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous research, which typically estimates target regions in the query using support prototypes and query pixels, we utilize the relationship between support and query prototypes. To achieve this, we utilize two complementary features: SAM Image Encoder features for pixel aggregation and ResNet features for class consistency. Specifically, we construct support and query prototypes with SAM features and distinguish query prototypes of target regions based on ResNet features. For the query prototype construction, we begin by roughly guiding foreground regions within SAM features using the conventional pseudo-mask, then employ iterative cross-attention to aggregate foreground features into learnable tokens. Here, we discover that the cross-attention weights can effectively alternate the conventional pseudo-mask. Therefore, we use the attention-based pseudo-mask to guide ResNet features to focus on the foreground, then infuse the guided ResNet feature into the learnable tokens to generate class-consistent query prototypes. The generation of the support prototype is conducted symmetrically to that of the query one, with the pseudo-mask replaced by the ground-truth mask. Finally, we compare these query prototypes with support ones to generate prompts, which subsequently produce object masks through the SAM Mask Decoder. Our state-of-the-art performances on various datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for FSS.

Machine Learning (ML) and Convolution Neural network (CNN) based Deep Learning (DL) techniques are primarily used for precise segmentation and classification of cancerous nodules in the CT (Computed Tomography) or MRI images. This study introduces an innovative approach to lung nodule segmentation by utilizing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) combined with transfer learning techniques. Precise segmentation of lung nodules is crucial for the early detection of lung cancer. The proposed method leverages Bounding Box prompts and a vision transformer model to enhance segmentation performance, achieving high accuracy, Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics. The integration of SAM and Transfer Learning significantly improves Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems in medical imaging, particularly for lung cancer diagnosis. The findings demonstrate the proposed model effectiveness in precisely segmenting lung nodules from CT scans, underscoring its potential to advance early detection and improve patient care outcomes in lung cancer diagnosis. The results show SAM Model with transfer learning achieving a DSC of 97.08% and an IoU of 95.6%, for segmentation and accuracy of 96.71% for classification indicates that ,its performance is noteworthy compared to existing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAM-Aware Graph Prompt Reasoning Network for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00303v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary challenge of cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is the domain disparity between the training and inference phases, which can exist in either the input data or the target classes. Previous models struggle to learn feature representations that generalize to various unknown domains from limited training domain samples. In contrast, the large-scale visual model SAM, pre-trained on tens of millions of images from various domains and classes, possesses excellent generalizability. In this work, we propose a SAM-aware graph prompt reasoning network (GPRN) that fully leverages SAM to guide CD-FSS feature representation learning and improve prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose a SAM-aware prompt initialization module (SPI) to transform the masks generated by SAM into visual prompts enriched with high-level semantic information. Since SAM tends to divide an object into many sub-regions, this may lead to visual prompts representing the same semantic object having inconsistent or fragmented features. We further propose a graph prompt reasoning (GPR) module that constructs a graph among visual prompts to reason about their interrelationships and enable each visual prompt to aggregate information from similar prompts, thus achieving global semantic consistency. Subsequently, each visual prompt embeds its semantic information into the corresponding mask region to assist in feature representation learning. To refine the segmentation mask during testing, we also design a non-parameter adaptive point selection module (APS) to select representative point prompts from query predictions and feed them back to SAM to refine inaccurate segmentation results. Experiments on four standard CD-FSS datasets demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art results. Code: https://github.com/CVL-hub/GPRN.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Promptable Anomaly Segmentation with SAM Through Self-Perception Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17217v4)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Model (SAM) has made great progress in anomaly segmentation tasks due to its impressive generalization ability. However, existing methods that directly apply SAM through prompting often overlook the domain shift issue, where SAM performs well on natural images but struggles in industrial scenarios. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) offers a promising solution, but it may yield suboptimal performance by not adequately addressing the perception challenges during adaptation to anomaly images. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{P}erceptinon \textbf{T}uning (\textbf{SPT}) method, aiming to enhance SAM's perception capability for anomaly segmentation. The SPT method incorporates a self-drafting tuning strategy, which generates an initial coarse draft of the anomaly mask, followed by a refinement process. Additionally, a visual-relation-aware adapter is introduced to improve the perception of discriminative relational information for mask generation. Extensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPT method can significantly outperform baseline methods, validating its effectiveness.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI-25 |
| **[SSE-SAM: Balancing Head and Tail Classes Gradually through Stage-Wise SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13715v2)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world datasets often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, where vast majority of classes known as tail classes have only few samples. Traditional methods tend to overfit on these tail classes. Recently, a new approach called Imbalanced SAM (ImbSAM) is proposed to leverage the generalization benefits of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) for long-tailed distributions. The main strategy is to merely enhance the smoothness of the loss function for tail classes. However, we argue that improving generalization in long-tail scenarios requires a careful balance between head and tail classes. We show that neither SAM nor ImbSAM alone can fully achieve this balance. For SAM, we prove that although it enhances the model's generalization ability by escaping saddle point in the overall loss landscape, it does not effectively address this for tail-class losses. Conversely, while ImbSAM is more effective at avoiding saddle points in tail classes, the head classes are trained insufficiently, resulting in significant performance drops. Based on these insights, we propose Stage-wise Saddle Escaping SAM (SSE-SAM), which uses complementary strengths of ImbSAM and SAM in a phased approach. Initially, SSE-SAM follows the majority sample to avoid saddle points of the head-class loss. During the later phase, it focuses on tail-classes to help them escape saddle points. Our experiments confirm that SSE-SAM has better ability in escaping saddles both on head and tail classes, and shows performance improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update: Add missing information and correct some grammatical issues</p></details> |

Addressing this performance gap is important to fully leverage the pre-trained weights of SAMs, particularly in the domain of volumetric medical image segmentation, where accuracy is important but well-annotated 3D medical data for fine-tuning is limited. In this work, we investigate whether introducing the memory mechanism as a plug-in, specifically the ability to memorize and recall internal representations of past inputs, can improve the performance of SAM with limited computation cost. To this end, we propose Memorizing SAM, a novel 3D SAM architecture incorporating a memory Transformer as a plug-in. Unlike conventional memorizing Transformers that save the internal representation during training or inference, our Memorizing SAM utilizes existing highly accurate internal representation as the memory source to ensure the quality of memory. We evaluate the performance of Memorizing SAM in 33 categories from the TotalSegmentator dataset, which indicates that Memorizing SAM can outperform state-of-the-art 3D SAM variant i.e., FastSAM3D with an average Dice increase of 11.36% at the cost of only 4.38 millisecond increase in inference time.

| **[Learnable Prompting SAM-induced Knowledge Distillation for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13742v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The limited availability of labeled data has driven advancements in semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation. Modern large-scale models tailored for general segmentation, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have revealed robust generalization capabilities. However, applying these models directly to medical image segmentation still exposes performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a learnable prompting SAM-induced Knowledge distillation framework (KnowSAM) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Firstly, we propose a Multi-view Co-training (MC) strategy that employs two distinct sub-networks to employ a co-teaching paradigm, resulting in more robust outcomes. Secondly, we present a Learnable Prompt Strategy (LPS) to dynamically produce dense prompts and integrate an adapter to fine-tune SAM specifically for medical image segmentation tasks. Moreover, we propose SAM-induced Knowledge Distillation (SKD) to transfer useful knowledge from SAM to two sub-networks, enabling them to learn from SAM's predictions and alleviate the effects of incorrect pseudo-labels during training. Notably, the predictions generated by our subnets are used to produce mask prompts for SAM, facilitating effective inter-module information exchange. Extensive experimental results on various medical segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation approaches. Crucially, our SAM distillation framework can be seamlessly integrated into other semi-supervised segmentation methods to enhance performance. The code will be released upon acceptance of this manuscript at: https://github.com/taozh2017/KnowSAM</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

SAM has shown promising binary segmentation performance in natural domains, however, transferring it to the medical domain remains challenging, as medical images often possess substantial inter-category overlaps. To address this, we propose the SEmantic-Guided SAM (SEG-SAM), a unified medical segmentation model that incorporates semantic medical knowledge to enhance medical segmentation performance. First, to avoid the potential conflict between binary and semantic predictions, we introduce a semantic-aware decoder independent of SAM's original decoder, specialized for both semantic segmentation on the prompted object and classification on unprompted objects in images. To further enhance the model's semantic understanding, we solicit key characteristics of medical categories from large language models and incorporate them into SEG-SAM through a text-to-vision semantic module, adaptively transferring the language information into the visual segmentation task. In the end, we introduce the cross-mask spatial alignment strategy to encourage greater overlap between the predicted masks from SEG-SAM's two decoders, thereby benefiting both predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEG-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art SAM-based methods in unified binary medical segmentation and task-specific methods in semantic medical segmentation, showcasing promising results and potential for broader medical applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

Retrieval-based SD methods, one kind of model-free method, have yielded promising speedup, but they often rely on incomplete retrieval resources, inefficient retrieval methods, and are constrained to certain domains. This paper presents a novel retrieval-based speculative decoding method that adapts suffix automaton (SAM) for efficient and accurate draft generation by utilizing common text corpus and dynamic text sequence. Unlike existing $n$-gram matching methods, SAM-Decoding finds the exact longest suffix match, achieving an average time complexity of O(1) per generation step of SAM update and suffix retrieval. It can also integrate with existing methods, adaptively selecting a draft generation strategy based on match length to generalize to broader domains. Extensive experiments on Spec-Bench show that our method is $18\%+$ faster than other retrieval-based SD methods. Additionally, when combined with advanced EAGLE-2, it provides an additional speedup of $3.28\%$ -- $11.13\%$ across various-sized LLM backbones.

XCT commonly accompanied by advanced image analysis and computer vision algorithms to extract relevant information from the images. Traditional computer vision models often struggle due to noise, resolution variability, and complex internal structures, particularly in scientific imaging applications. State-of-the-art foundational models, like the Segment Anything Model (SAM)-designed for general-purpose image segmentation-have revolutionized image segmentation across various domains, yet their application in specialized fields like materials science remains under-explored. In this work, we explore the application and limitations of SAM for industrial X-ray CT inspection of additive manufacturing components. We demonstrate that while SAM shows promise, it struggles with out-of-distribution data, multiclass segmentation, and computational efficiency during fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose a fine-tuning strategy utilizing parameter-efficient techniques, specifically Conv-LoRa, to adapt SAM for material-specific datasets. Additionally, we leverage generative adversarial network (GAN)-generated data to enhance the training process and improve the model's segmentation performance on complex X-ray CT data. Our experimental results highlight the importance of tailored segmentation models for accurate inspection, showing that fine-tuning SAM on domain-specific scientific imaging data significantly improves performance. However, despite improvements, the model's ability to generalize across diverse datasets remains limited, highlighting the need for further research into robust, scalable solutions for domain-specific segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |

SAM-IF addresses the challenges of class-agnostic instance segmentation by introducing a multi-class classifier and fine-tuning SAM to focus on specific target objects. To enhance few-shot learning capabilities, SAM-IF employs a cosine-similarity-based classifier, enabling efficient adaptation to novel classes with minimal data. Additionally, SAM-IF supports incremental learning by updating classifier weights without retraining the decoder. Our method achieves competitive but more reasonable results compared to existing approaches, particularly in scenarios requiring specific object segmentation with limited labeled data.</p></details> |  |

| **[ViRefSAM: Visual Reference-Guided Segment Anything Model for Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02294v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically, ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features, enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$, LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Baltimore Atlas: FreqWeaver Adapter for Semi-supervised Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15565v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on 1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery, which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution remote sensing segmentation approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[RS-MTDF: Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion for Remote Sensing Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08772v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation in remote sensing images is crucial for various applications, yet its performance is heavily reliant on large-scale, high-quality pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS methods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization. To alleviate this issue, we attempt to introduce the Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) pre-trained on vast and diverse datasets into the SSS task since VFMs possess robust generalization capabilities that can effectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for SSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge embedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing. Specifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (e.g., DINOv2 and CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student features with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative power, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder. Extensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing approaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in the majority of semantic categories. These results underscore the efficacy of multi-teacher VFM guidance in significantly enhancing both generalization and semantic understanding for remote sensing segmentation. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each proposed module.</p></details> |  |
| **[F2Net: A Frequency-Fused Network for Ultra-High Resolution Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07847v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery is critical for applications like environmental monitoring and urban planning but faces computational and optimization challenges. Conventional methods either lose fine details through downsampling or fragment global context via patch processing. While multi-branch networks address this trade-off, they suffer from computational inefficiency and conflicting gradient dynamics during training. We propose F2Net, a frequency-aware framework that decomposes UHR images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing. The high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution structural details, while the low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs through dual sub-branches capturing short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module integrates these observations, guided by two novel objectives: Cross-Frequency Alignment Loss ensures semantic consistency between frequency components, and Cross-Frequency Balance Loss regulates gradient magnitudes across branches to stabilize training. Evaluated on DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial benchmarks, F2Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 and 83.39, respectively. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate the extent to which urban sounds correspond with visual scenes by comparing various visual representation strategies in capturing acoustic semantics. We employ a multimodal approach that integrates geo-referenced sound recordings with both street-level and remote sensing imagery across three major global cities: London, New York, and Tokyo. Utilizing the AST model for audio, along with CLIP and RemoteCLIP for imagery, as well as CLIPSeg and Seg-Earth OV for semantic segmentation, we extract embeddings and class-level features to evaluate cross-modal similarity. The results indicate that street view embeddings demonstrate stronger alignment with environmental sounds compared to segmentation outputs, whereas remote sensing segmentation is more effective in interpreting ecological categories through a Biophony--Geophony--Anthrophony (BGA) framework. These findings imply that embedding-based models offer superior semantic alignment, while segmentation-based methods provide interpretable links between visual structure and acoustic ecology. This work advances the burgeoning field of multimodal urban sensing by offering novel perspectives for incorporating sound into geospatial analysis.</p></details> |  |

Open-vocabulary image Segmentation addresses these generalization issues in traditional supervised segmentation models while reducing reliance on extensive per-pixel annotations, which are both expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. Most Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) methods are designed for natural images but struggle with remote sensing data due to scale variations, orientation changes, and complex scene compositions. This necessitates the development of OVS approaches specifically tailored for remote sensing. In this context, we propose AerOSeg, a novel OVS approach for remote sensing data. First, we compute robust image-text correlation features using multiple rotated versions of the input image and domain-specific prompts. These features are then refined through spatial and class refinement blocks. Inspired by the success of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in diverse domains, we leverage SAM features to guide the spatial refinement of correlation features. Additionally, we introduce a semantic back-projection module and loss to ensure the seamless propagation of SAM's semantic information throughout the segmentation pipeline. Finally, we enhance the refined correlation features using a multi-scale attention-aware decoder to produce the final segmentation map. We validate our SAM-guided Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Segmentation model on three benchmark remote sensing datasets: iSAID, DLRSD, and OpenEarthMap. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.54 h-mIoU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EarthVision workshop, CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Moreover, existing semantic segmentation models for remote sensing images usually employ a vanilla softmax classifier, which has three drawbacks: (1) non-direct supervision for the pixel representations during training; (2) inadequate modeling ability of parametric softmax classifiers under large intraclass variance; and (3) opaque process of classification decision. In this paper, we propose a novel classifier (called CenterSeg) customized for RSI semantic segmentation, which solves the abovementioned problems with multiple prototypes, direct supervision under Grassmann manifold, and interpretability strategy. Specifically, for each class, our CenterSeg obtains local class centers by aggregating corresponding pixel features based on ground-truth masks, and generates multiple prototypes through hard attention assignment and momentum updating. In addition, we introduce the Grassmann manifold and constrain the joint embedding space of pixel features and prototypes based on two additional regularization terms. Especially, during the inference, CenterSeg can further provide interpretability to the model by restricting the prototype as a sample of the training set. Experimental results on three remote sensing segmentation datasets validate the effectiveness of the model. Besides the superior performance, CenterSeg has the advantages of simplicity, lightweight, compatibility, and interpretability.

The performance of existing supervised models in remote sensing image segmentation tasks highly depends on the quality of label data. However, current label data mainly relies on manual annotation, which comes with high time costs and is subject to subjective interference, resulting in distortion of label boundaries and often a loss of detail. To solve the above problems, our work proposes an Edge-enhanced Labeling Network, called SAM2-ELNet, which incorporates a labeling module and an edge attention mechanism. This model effectively addresses issues such as label detail loss, fragmentation, and inaccurate boundaries. Due to the scarcity of manually annotated remote sensing data, the feature extraction capabilities of traditional neural networks are limited. Our method uses the Hiera backbone of the pre-trained self-supervised large model segment anything model 2 (SAM2) as the encoder, achieves high-quality and efficient feature extraction even with small samples by fine-tuning on downstream tasks. This study compared the training effects of original and enhanced labels on the manually annotated Deep-SAR Oil Spill (SOS) dataset. Results showed that the model trained with enhanced labels performed better and had a lower final loss, indicating closer alignment with the real data distribution. Our work also explores the potential of extending the model into an efficient automatic annotation framework through generalization experiments, facilitating large-scale remote sensing image interpretation and intelligent recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detect Changes like Humans: Incorporating Semantic Priors for Improved Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16918v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When given two similar images, humans identify their differences by comparing the appearance ({\it e.g., color, texture}) with the help of semantics ({\it e.g., objects, relations}). However, mainstream change detection models adopt a supervised training paradigm, where the annotated binary change map is the main constraint. Thus, these methods primarily emphasize the difference-aware features between bi-temporal images and neglect the semantic understanding of the changed landscapes, which undermines the accuracy in the presence of noise and illumination variations. To this end, this paper explores incorporating semantic priors to improve the ability to detect changes. Firstly, we propose a Semantic-Aware Change Detection network, namely SA-CDNet, which transfers the common knowledge of the visual foundation models ({\it i.e., FastSAM}) to change detection. Inspired by the human visual paradigm, a novel dual-stream feature decoder is derived to distinguish changes by combining semantic-aware features and difference-aware features. Secondly, we design a single-temporal semantic pre-training strategy to enhance the semantic understanding of landscapes, which brings further increments. Specifically, we construct pseudo-change detection data from public single-temporal remote sensing segmentation datasets for large-scale pre-training, where an extra branch is also introduced for the proxy semantic segmentation task. Experimental results on five challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over the existing state-of-the-art methods.

This task presents two principal challenges: (1) severe inconsistencies in feature representation across different remote sensing domains, and (2) a domain gap that emerges due to the representation bias of source domain patterns when translating features to predictive logits. To tackle these issues, we propose a joint-optimized adversarial network incorporating the "Segment Anything Model (SAM) (SAM-JOANet)" for UDA-RSSeg. Our approach integrates SAM to leverage its robust generalized representation capabilities, thereby alleviating feature inconsistencies. We introduce a finetuning decoder designed to convert SAM-Encoder features into predictive logits. Additionally, a feature-level adversarial-based prompted segmentor is employed to generate class-agnostic maps, which guide the finetuning decoder's feature representations. The network is optimized end-to-end, combining the prompted segmentor and the finetuning decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including ISPRS (Potsdam/Vaihingen) and CITY-OSM (Paris/Chicago), demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The results, supported by visualization and analysis, confirm the method's interpretability and robustness.

In addition, existing graph contrastive learning methods usually adopt the way of maximizing mutual information to keep the node representations consistent between different graph views, which may cause the model to learn task-independent redundant information. To tackle the above problems, this paper treats images as graph structures and introduces a simple contrastive vision GNN (SC-ViG) architecture for remote sensing segmentation. Specifically, we construct a node-masked and edge-masked graph view to obtain an optimal graph structure representation, which can adaptively learn whether to mask nodes and edges. Furthermore, this paper innovatively introduces information bottleneck theory into graph contrastive learning to maximize task-related information while minimizing task-independent redundant information.

However, objects of the same category within HRS images generally show significant differences in scale and shape across diverse geographical environments, making it difficult to fit the data distribution. Additionally, a complex background environment causes similar appearances of objects of different categories, which precipitates a substantial number of objects into misclassification as background. These issues make existing learning algorithms sub-optimal. In this work, we solve the above-mentioned problems by proposing a High-resolution remote sensing network (Hi-ResNet) with efficient network structure designs, which consists of a funnel module, a multi-branch module with stacks of information aggregation (IA) blocks, and a feature refinement module, sequentially, and Class-agnostic Edge Aware (CEA) loss. Specifically, we propose a funnel module to downsample, which reduces the computational cost, and extract high-resolution semantic information from the initial input image. Secondly, we downsample the processed feature images into multi-resolution branches incrementally to capture image features at different scales and apply IA blocks, which capture key latent information by leveraging attention mechanisms, for effective feature aggregation, distinguishing image features of the same class with variant scales and shapes. Finally, our feature refinement module integrate the CEA loss function, which disambiguates inter-class objects with similar shapes and increases the data distribution distance for correct predictions. With effective pre-training strategies, we demonstrated the superiority of Hi-ResNet over state-of-the-art methods on three HRS segmentation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

To fill the gap, our work introduces an innovative auto-labeling framework named ALPS (Automatic Labeling for Pre-training in Segmentation), leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to predict precise pseudo-labels for RS images without necessitating prior annotations or additional prompts. The proposed pipeline significantly reduces the labor and resource demands traditionally associated with annotating RS datasets. By constructing two comprehensive pseudo-labeled RS datasets via ALPS for pre-training purposes, our approach enhances the performance of downstream tasks across various benchmarks, including iSAID and ISPRS Potsdam. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its ability to generalize well across multiple tasks even under the scarcity of extensively annotated datasets, offering a scalable solution to automatic segmentation and annotation challenges in the field. In addition, the proposed a pipeline is flexible and can be applied to medical image segmentation, remarkably boosting the performance. Note that ALPS utilizes pre-trained SAM to semi-automatically annotate RS images without additional manual annotations. Though every component in the pipeline has bee well explored, integrating clustering algorithms with SAM and novel pseudo-label alignment significantly enhances RS segmentation, as an off-the-shelf tool for pre-training data preparation.

Previous efforts are dedicated to mining segmentation-guiding visual cues from a constrained set of support samples. However, they still struggle to address the pronounced intra-class differences in RS images, as sparse visual cues make it challenging to establish robust class-specific representations. In this paper, we propose a holistic semantic embedding (HSE) approach that effectively harnesses general semantic knowledge, i.e., class description (CD) embeddings.Instead of the naive combination of CD embeddings and visual features for segmentation decoding, we investigate embedding the general semantic knowledge during the feature extraction stage.Specifically, in HSE, a spatial dense interaction module allows the interaction of visual support features with CD embeddings along the spatial dimension via self-attention.Furthermore, a global content modulation module efficiently augments the global information of the target category in both support and query features, thanks to the transformative fusion of visual features and CD embeddings.These two components holistically synergize general CD embeddings and visual cues, constructing a robust class-specific representation.Through extensive experiments on the standard FSS benchmark, the proposed HSE approach demonstrates superior performance compared to peer work, setting a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

This framework employs a two-stage network design: the first stage extracts features using spatial methods to obtain features with sufficient spatial details and semantic information; the second stage maps these features in both spatial and frequency domains. In the frequency domain mapping, we introduce the Wavelet Transform Feature Decomposer (WTFD) structure, which decomposes features into low-frequency and high-frequency components using the Haar wavelet transform and integrates them with spatial features. To bridge the semantic gap between frequency and spatial features, and facilitate significant feature selection to promote the combination of features from different representation domains, we design the Multiscale Dual-Representation Alignment Filter (MDAF). This structure utilizes multiscale convolutions and dual-cross attentions. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, SFFNet achieves superior performance in terms of mIoU, reaching 84.80% and 87.73% respectively.The code is located at https://github.com/yysdck/SFFNet.</p></details> |  |

Segmentation and extraction of specific targets are essential tasks when facing the vast and complex remote sensing images. Recently, the introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides a universal pre-training model for image segmentation tasks. While the direct application of SAM to remote sensing image segmentation tasks does not yield satisfactory results, we propose RSAM-Seg, which stands for Remote Sensing SAM with Semantic Segmentation, as a tailored modification of SAM for the remote sensing field and eliminates the need for manual intervention to provide prompts. Adapter-Scale, a set of supplementary scaling modules, are proposed in the multi-head attention blocks of the encoder part of SAM. Furthermore, Adapter-Feature are inserted between the Vision Transformer (ViT) blocks. These modules aim to incorporate high-frequency image information and image embedding features to generate image-informed prompts. Experiments are conducted on four distinct remote sensing scenarios, encompassing cloud detection, field monitoring, building detection and road mapping tasks . The experimental results not only showcase the improvement over the original SAM and U-Net across cloud, buildings, fields and roads scenarios, but also highlight the capacity of RSAM-Seg to discern absent areas within the ground truth of certain datasets, affirming its potential as an auxiliary annotation method. In addition, the performance in few-shot scenarios is commendable, underscores its potential in dealing with limited datasets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

There are two research gaps in the current research: 1) Most studies only focus on the relationship between design elements and pay little attention to the external information of the site; 2) GAN and other traditional generative algorithms generate results with low resolution and insufficient details. To address these two problems, we integrate GAN, Stable diffusion multimodal large-scale image pre-training model to construct a full-process park generative design method: 1) First, construct a high-precision remote sensing object extraction system for automated extraction of urban environmental information; 2) Secondly, use GAN to construct a park design generation system based on the external environment, which can quickly infer and generate design schemes from urban environmental information; 3) Finally, introduce Stable Diffusion to optimize the design plan, fill in details, and expand the resolution of the plan by 64 times. This method can achieve a fully unmanned design automation workflow. The research results show that: 1) The relationship between the inside and outside of the site will affect the algorithm generation results. 2) Compared with traditional GAN algorithms, Stable diffusion significantly improve the information richness of the generated results.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, this paper proposes an efficient Generative Adversarial Transfomer (GATrans) for achieving high-precision semantic segmentation while maintaining an extremely efficient size. The framework utilizes a Global Transformer Network (GTNet) as the generator, efficiently extracting multi-level features through residual connections. GTNet employs global transformer blocks with progressively linear computational complexity to reassign global features based on a learnable similarity function. To focus on object-level and pixel-level information, the GATrans optimizes the objective function by combining structural similarity losses. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on the Vaihingen dataset, achieving an average F1 score of 90.17% and an overall accuracy of 91.92%.</p></details> |  |

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn unique and adaptive features to achieve this aim. However, due to the large size and high spatial resolution of remote sensing images, these networks cannot analyze an entire scene efficiently. Recently, deep transformers have proven their capability to record global interactions between different objects in the image. In this paper, we propose a new segmentation model that combines convolutional neural networks with transformers, and show that this mixture of local and global feature extraction techniques provides significant advantages in remote sensing segmentation. In addition, the proposed model includes two fusion layers that are designed to represent multi-modal inputs and output of the network efficiently. The input fusion layer extracts feature maps summarizing the relationship between image content and elevation maps (DSM). The output fusion layer uses a novel multi-task segmentation strategy where class labels are identified using class-specific feature extraction layers and loss functions. Finally, a fast-marching method is used to convert all unidentified class labels to their closest known neighbors. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methodology improves segmentation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

These methods are especially valuable for remote sensing tasks where producing labeled ground truth datasets can be prohibitively expensive but there is easy access to a wealth of unlabeled imagery. We perform a rigorous evaluation of SimCLR, a self-supervised method, and FixMatch, a semi-supervised method, on three remote sensing tasks: riverbed segmentation, land cover mapping, and flood mapping. We quantify performance improvements on these remote sensing segmentation tasks when additional imagery outside of the original supervised dataset is made available for training. We also design experiments to test the effectiveness of these techniques when the test set is domain shifted to sample different geographic areas compared to the training and validation sets. We find that such techniques significantly improve generalization performance when labeled data is limited and there are geographic domain shifts between the training data and the validation/test data.</p></details> |  |

However, existing RS VQA datasets are constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain. RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1 then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises 13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs), demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Multimedia Conference (ACM Multimedia 2025)</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and (3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large language model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal large language models and remote sensing vision-language models.

A key challenge lies in the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several works introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs. However, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the quality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data, while only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for generating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using Rule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs generation methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from multiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset, including about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two VLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an image-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP and RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only 4.2\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches across benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or even exceed manual annotations.

In this work, we focus on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), a Vision-Language foundation model that achieves high accuracy across various image classification tasks and often rivals fully supervised baselines, despite not being explicitly trained for those tasks. Nevertheless, there are still domains where zero-shot CLIP performance is far from optimal, such as Remote Sensing (RS) and medical imagery. These domains do not only exhibit fundamentally different distributions compared to natural images, but also commonly rely on complementary modalities, beyond RGB, to derive meaningful insights. To this end, we propose a methodology to align distinct RS image modalities with the visual and textual modalities of CLIP. Our two-stage procedure addresses the aforementioned distribution shift, extends the zero-shot capabilities of CLIP and enriches CLIP's shared embedding space with domain-specific knowledge. Initially, we robustly fine-tune CLIP according to the PAINT (Ilharco et al., 2022) patching protocol, in order to deal with the distribution shift. Building upon this foundation, we facilitate the cross-modal alignment of a RS modality encoder by distilling knowledge from the CLIP visual and textual encoders. We empirically show that both patching and cross-modal alignment translate to significant performance gains, across several RS imagery classification and cross-modal retrieval benchmark datasets. Notably, these enhancements are achieved without the reliance on textual descriptions, without introducing any task-specific parameters, without training from scratch and without catastrophic forgetting.

These models combine various data modalities, such as optical, radar, and LiDAR imagery, with textual and geographic information, enabling more comprehensive analysis and understanding of remote sensing data. The integration of multiple modalities allows for improved performance in tasks like object detection, land cover classification, and change detection, which are often challenged by the complex and heterogeneous nature of remote sensing data. However, despite these advancements, several challenges remain. The diversity in data types, the need for large-scale annotated datasets, and the complexity of multimodal fusion techniques pose significant obstacles to the effective deployment of these models. Moreover, the computational demands of training and fine-tuning multimodal models require significant resources, further complicating their practical application in remote sensing image interpretation tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in vision and multimodal foundation models for remote sensing, focusing on their architecture, training methods, datasets and application scenarios. We discuss the key challenges these models face, such as data alignment, cross-modal transfer learning, and scalability, while also identifying emerging research directions aimed at overcoming these limitations.

While performing well in multi-modal reasoning and multi-turn conversations, the existing models lack pixel-level understanding and struggle with multi-image inputs. In this work, we propose RSUniVLM, a unified, end-to-end RS VLM designed for comprehensive vision understanding across multiple granularity, including image-level, region-level, and pixel-level tasks. RSUniVLM also performs effectively in multi-image analysis, with instances of change detection and change captioning.

We also construct a large-scale RS instruction-following dataset based on a variety of existing datasets in both RS and general domain, encompassing various tasks such as object localization, visual question answering, and semantic segmentation.

However, existing remote sensing vision language models (RSVLMs) often fall short in capturing the complex characteristics of remote sensing scenes, as they typically rely on low resolution, single scale visual features and simplistic methods to map visual features to language features. In this paper, we present Aquila, an advanced visual language foundation model designed to enable richer visual feature representation and more precise visual-language feature alignment for remote sensing images. Our approach introduces a learnable Hierarchical Spatial Feature Integration (SFI) module that supports high resolution image inputs and aggregates multi scale visual features, allowing for the detailed representation of complex visual information. Additionally, the SFI module is repeatedly integrated into the layers of the large language model (LLM) to achieve deep visual language feature alignment, without compromising the model's performance in natural language processing tasks. These innovations, capturing detailed visual effects through higher resolution and multi scale input, and enhancing feature alignment significantly improve the model's ability to learn from image text data. We validate the effectiveness of Aquila through extensive quantitative experiments and qualitative analyses, demonstrating its superior performance.</p></details> |  |

In the realm of remote sensing (RS), there is a growing interest in developing large vision language models (VLMs) specifically tailored for data analysis in this domain. However, current research predominantly revolves around visual recognition tasks, lacking comprehensive, large-scale image-text datasets that are aligned and suitable for training large VLMs, which poses significant challenges to effectively training such models for RS applications. In computer vision, recent research has demonstrated that fine-tuning large vision language models on small-scale, high-quality datasets can yield impressive performance in visual and language understanding. These results are comparable to state-of-the-art VLMs trained from scratch on massive amounts of data, such as GPT-4. Inspired by this captivating idea, in this work, we build a high-quality Remote Sensing Image Captioning dataset (RSICap) that facilitates the development of large VLMs in the RS field. Unlike previous RS datasets that either employ model-generated captions or short descriptions, RSICap comprises 2,585 human-annotated captions with rich and high-quality information. This dataset offers detailed descriptions for each image, encompassing scene descriptions (e.g., residential area, airport, or farmland) as well as object information (e.g., color, shape, quantity, absolute position, etc). To facilitate the evaluation of VLMs in the field of RS, we also provide a benchmark evaluation dataset called RSIEval. This dataset consists of human-annotated captions and visual question-answer pairs, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of VLMs in the context of RS.</p></details> |  |

This absence limits their usefulness for developing accurate report generation AI. To address this gap, we present AbdomenAtlas 3.0, the first public, high-quality abdominal CT dataset with detailed, expert-reviewed radiology reports. All reports are paired with per-voxel masks and they describe liver, kidney and pancreatic tumors. AbdomenAtlas 3.0 has 9,262 triplets of CT, mask and report--3,955 with tumors. These CT scans come from 17 public datasets. Besides creating the reports for these datasets, we expanded their number of tumor masks by 4.2x, identifying 3,011 new tumor cases. Notably, the reports in AbdomenAtlas 3.0 are more standardized, and generated faster than traditional human-made reports. They provide details like tumor size, location, attenuation and surgical resectability. These reports were created by 12 board-certified radiologists using our proposed RadGPT, a novel framework that converted radiologist-revised tumor segmentation masks into structured and narrative reports. Besides being a dataset creation tool, RadGPT can also become a fully-automatic, segmentation-assisted report generation method. We benchmarked this method and 5 state-of-the-art report generation vision-language models. Our results show that segmentation strongly improves tumor detection in AI-made reports.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Embod...</summary><p>Embodied-R1 technical report</p></details> |

However, we observe that their performance degrades significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code is available at https://github.com/yejipark-m/FOCUS</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models through Intermediate Projector Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13739v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However, current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage, without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Vision-Language Retrieval of Educational Metaverse Content in Agriculture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13713v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\% MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices.

In this work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments, investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3 (74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance, decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

However, hallucination issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential. Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation (\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Fi...</summary><p>In Figure 2, the correlation coefficient and the scatter plot do not match.

Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient, highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date, containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau, improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced closed-source models.</p></details> | technical report |

However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically, DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** - to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025, Project: https://github.com/xiaozhen228/DictAS</p></details> |

This study presents the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs), including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset, which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models, particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training, inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment. This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[DISCO: Language-Guided Manipulation with Diffusion Policies and Constrained Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09767v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have demonstrated strong performance in generative modeling, making them promising for robotic manipulation guided by natural language instructions. However, generalizing language-conditioned diffusion policies to open-vocabulary instructions in everyday scenarios remains challenging due to the scarcity and cost of robot demonstration datasets. To address this, we propose DISCO, a framework that leverages off-the-shelf vision-language models (VLMs) to bridge natural language understanding with high-performance diffusion policies. DISCO translates linguistic task descriptions into actionable 3D keyframes using VLMs, which then guide the diffusion process through constrained inpainting. However, enforcing strict adherence to these keyframes can degrade performance when the VLM-generated keyframes are inaccurate. To mitigate this, we introduce an inpainting optimization strategy that balances keyframe adherence with learned motion priors from training data. Experimental results in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that DISCO outperforms conventional fine-tuned language-conditioned policies, achieving superior generalization in zero-shot, open-vocabulary manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces STER-VLM, a computationally efficient framework that enhances VLM performance through (1) caption decomposition to tackle spatial and temporal information separately, (2) temporal frame selection with best-view filtering for sufficient temporal information, and (3) reference-driven understanding for capturing fine-grained motion and dynamic context and (4) curated visual/textual prompt techniques. Experimental results on the WTS \cite{kong2024wts} and BDD \cite{BDD} datasets demonstrate substantial gains in semantic richness and traffic scene interpretation. Our framework is validated through a decent test score of 55.655 in the AI City Challenge 2025 Track 2, showing its effectiveness in advancing resource-efficient and accurate traffic analysis for real-world applications.</p></details> | ICCV Workshop 2025 |
| **[Enhancing Visual Reliance in Text Generation: A Bayesian Perspective on Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19498v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually generate texts which satisfy context coherence but don't match the visual input. Such a hallucination issue hinders LVLMs' applicability in the real world. The key to solving hallucination in LVLM is to make the text generation rely more on the visual content. Most previous works choose to enhance/adjust the features/output of a specific modality (i.e., visual or textual) to alleviate hallucinations in LVLM, which do not explicitly or systematically enhance the visual reliance. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the factors which may degenerate the visual reliance in text generation of LVLM from a Bayesian perspective. Based on our observations, we propose to mitigate hallucination in LVLM from three aspects. Firstly, we observe that not all visual tokens are informative in generating meaningful texts. We propose to evaluate and remove redundant visual tokens to avoid their disturbance. Secondly, LVLM may encode inappropriate prior information, making it lean toward generating unexpected words. We propose a simple yet effective way to rectify the prior from a Bayesian perspective. Thirdly, we observe that starting from certain steps, the posterior of next-token prediction conditioned on visual tokens may collapse to a prior distribution which does not depend on any informative visual tokens at all. Thus, we propose to stop further text generation to avoid hallucination. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks including POPE, CHAIR, and MME demonstrate that our method can consistently mitigate the hallucination issue of LVLM and performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAST: Counterfactual Labels Improve Instruction Following in Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13446v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robots should be able to understand and follow user instructions, but current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with following fine-grained commands despite providing a powerful architecture for mapping open-vocabulary natural language instructions to robot actions. One cause for this is a lack of semantic diversity and language grounding in existing robot datasets and, specifically, a lack of fine-grained task diversity for similar observations. To address this, we present a novel method to augment existing robot datasets by leveraging vision language models to create counterfactual labels. Our method improves the language-following capabilities of VLAs by increasing the diversity and granularity of language grounding for robot datasets by generating counterfactual language and actions. We evaluate the resulting model's ability to follow language instructions, ranging from simple object-centric commands to complex referential tasks, by conducting visual language navigation experiments in 3 different indoor and outdoor environments. Our experiments demonstrate that counterfactual relabeling, without any additional data collection, significantly improves instruction-following in VLA policies, making them competitive with state-of-the-art methods and increasing success rate by 27% on navigation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Prompting and Multi-Agent Knowledge Distillation for Traffic Video Interpretation and Risk Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13439v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models (VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

This bias allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question (Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O) settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings, providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new annotations will be released soon.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Basic Category Usage in Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12530v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of psychology has long recognized a basic level of categorization that humans use when labeling visual stimuli, a term coined by Rosch in 1976. This level of categorization has been found to be used most frequently, to have higher information density, and to aid in visual language tasks with priming in humans. Here, we investigate basic-level categorization in two recently released, open-source vision-language models (VLMs). This paper demonstrates that Llama 3.2 Vision Instruct (11B) and Molmo 7B-D both prefer basic-level categorization consistent with human behavior. Moreover, the models' preferences are consistent with nuanced human behaviors like the biological versus non-biological basic level effects and the well-established expert basic level shift, further suggesting that VLMs acquire complex cognitive categorization behaviors from the human data on which they are trained. We also find our expert prompting methods demonstrate lower accuracy then our non-expert prompting methods, contradicting popular thought regarding the use of expertise prompting methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prune2Drive: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Accelerating Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13305v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception, reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras. This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling, which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens, our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes 13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM benchmark.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or 2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks. Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs), state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.</p></details> |  |

Rendering fidelity and speed are now ready even for demanding virtual reality applications. However, the problem of assisting humans in collecting the input images for these rendering algorithms has received much less attention. High-quality view synthesis requires uniform and dense view sampling. Unfortunately, these requirements are not easily addressed by human camera operators, who are in a hurry, impatient, or lack understanding of the scene structure and the photographic process. Existing approaches to guide humans during image acquisition concentrate on single objects or neglect view-dependent material characteristics. We propose a novel situated visualization technique for scanning at multiple scales. During the scanning of a scene, our method identifies important objects that need extended image coverage to properly represent view-dependent appearance. To this end, we leverage semantic segmentation and category identification, ranked by a vision-language model. Spherical proxies are generated around highly ranked objects to guide the user during scanning. Our results show superior performance in real scenes compared to conventional view sampling strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is a pre-print version of a paper that has been accepted to the IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality for future publication.

| **[Breaking Reward Collapse: Adaptive Reinforcement for Open-ended Medical Reasoning with Enhanced Semantic Discrimination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12957v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards has demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning and generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs), while reducing computational overhead. However, its application in medical imaging remains underexplored. Existing reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) approaches in this domain primarily target closed-ended visual question answering (VQA), limiting their applicability to real-world clinical reasoning. In contrast, open-ended medical VQA better reflects clinical practice but has received limited attention. While some efforts have sought to unify both formats via semantically guided RL, we observe that model-based semantic rewards often suffer from reward collapse, where responses with significant semantic differences receive similar scores. To address this, we propose ARMed (Adaptive Reinforcement for Medical Reasoning), a novel RL framework for open-ended medical VQA. ARMed first incorporates domain knowledge through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data, then applies reinforcement learning with textual correctness and adaptive semantic rewards to enhance reasoning quality. We evaluate ARMed on six challenging medical VQA benchmarks. Results show that ARMed consistently boosts both accuracy and generalization, achieving a 32.64% improvement on in-domain tasks and an 11.65% gain on out-of-domain benchmarks. These results highlight the critical role of reward discriminability in medical RL and the promise of semantically guided rewards for enabling robust and clinically meaningful multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboRetriever: Single-Camera Robot Object Retrieval via Active and Interactive Perception with Dynamic Scene Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12916v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans effortlessly retrieve objects in cluttered, partially observable environments by combining visual reasoning, active viewpoint adjustment, and physical interaction-with only a single pair of eyes. In contrast, most existing robotic systems rely on carefully positioned fixed or multi-camera setups with complete scene visibility, which limits adaptability and incurs high hardware costs. We present \textbf{RoboRetriever}, a novel framework for real-world object retrieval that operates using only a \textbf{single} wrist-mounted RGB-D camera and free-form natural language instructions. RoboRetriever grounds visual observations to build and update a \textbf{dynamic hierarchical scene graph} that encodes object semantics, geometry, and inter-object relations over time. The supervisor module reasons over this memory and task instruction to infer the target object and coordinate an integrated action module combining \textbf{active perception}, \textbf{interactive perception}, and \textbf{manipulation}. To enable task-aware scene-grounded active perception, we introduce a novel visual prompting scheme that leverages large reasoning vision-language models to determine 6-DoF camera poses aligned with the semantic task goal and geometry scene context. We evaluate RoboRetriever on diverse real-world object retrieval tasks, including scenarios with human intervention, demonstrating strong adaptability and robustness in cluttered scenes with only one RGB-D camera.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRIDE: A Text-assisted Radar-Image weather-aware fusion network for Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08038v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth estimation, essential for autonomous driving, seeks to interpret the 3D environment surrounding vehicles. The development of radar sensors, known for their cost-efficiency and robustness, has spurred interest in radar-camera fusion-based solutions. However, existing algorithms fuse features from these modalities without accounting for weather conditions, despite radars being known to be more robust than cameras under adverse weather. Additionally, while Vision-Language models have seen rapid advancement, utilizing language descriptions alongside other modalities for depth estimation remains an open challenge. This paper first introduces a text-generation strategy along with feature extraction and fusion techniques that can assist monocular depth estimation pipelines, leading to improved accuracy across different algorithms on the KITTI dataset. Building on this, we propose TRIDE, a radar-camera fusion algorithm that enhances text feature extraction by incorporating radar point information. To address the impact of weather on sensor performance, we introduce a weather-aware fusion block that adaptively adjusts radar weighting based on current weather conditions. Our method, benchmarked on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrates performance gains over the state-of-the-art, achieving a 12.87% improvement in MAE and a 9.08% improvement in RMSE.

These methods leverage the pretrained knowledge of VLMs to enable effective domain adaptation while mitigating overfitting through parameter-efficient tuning or instance-based consistency constraints. However, such regularizations often neglect the geometric structure of data distribution, which may lead to distortion of the overall semantic representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel fine-tuning method, Manifold-Preserving and Sculpting Tuning (MPS-Tuning). Regarding the data distribution in feature space as a semantic manifold, MPS-Tuning explicitly constrains the intrinsic geometry of this manifold while further sculpting it to enhance class separability. Specifically, MPS-Tuning preserves both macroscopic and microscopic topological structures of the original manifold by aligning Gram matrices of features before and after fine-tuning. Theoretically, this constraint is shown to approximate an upper bound of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, features from the image and text modalities are paired, and pairwise similarities are optimized to enhance the manifold's class discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPS-Tuning significantly improves model performance while effectively preserving the structure of the semantic manifold. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |

These methods exploit inherent pre-learned knowledge in VLMs and have achieved strong performance on standard image datasets. However, their effectiveness is often limited when confronted with cross-domain tasks where imaging domains differ from natural images. To address this limitation, we propose Consistency-guided Multi-view Collaborative Optimization (CoMuCo), a novel fine-tuning strategy for VLMs. This strategy employs two functionally complementary expert modules to extract multi-view features, while incorporating prior knowledge-based consistency constraints and information geometry-based consensus mechanisms to enhance the robustness of feature learning. Additionally, a new cross-domain few-shot benchmark is established to help comprehensively evaluate methods on imaging domains distinct from natural images. Extensive empirical evaluations on both existing and newly proposed benchmarks suggest CoMuCo consistently outperforms current methods in few-shot tasks. The code and benchmark will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimization of Prompt Learning via Multi-Knowledge Representation for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10357v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, play a foundational role in various cross-modal applications. To fully leverage VLMs' potential in adapting to downstream tasks, context optimization methods like Prompt Tuning are essential. However, one key limitation is the lack of diversity in prompt templates, whether they are hand-crafted or learned through additional modules. This limitation restricts the capabilities of pretrained VLMs and can result in incorrect predictions in downstream tasks. To address this challenge, we propose Context Optimization with Multi-Knowledge Representation (CoKnow), a framework that enhances Prompt Learning for VLMs with rich contextual knowledge. To facilitate CoKnow during inference, we trained lightweight semantic knowledge mappers, which are capable of generating Multi-Knowledge Representation for an input image without requiring additional priors. Experimentally, We conducted extensive experiments on 11 publicly available datasets, demonstrating that CoKnow outperforms a series of previous methods.</p></details> |  |

Can VLM be a Road Safety Assessor Using the iRAP Standard?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10872v5)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road safety assessments are critical yet costly, especially in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), where most roads remain unrated. Traditional methods require expert annotation and training data, while supervised learning-based approaches struggle to generalise across regions. In this paper, we introduce \textit{V-RoAst}, a zero-shot Visual Question Answering (VQA) framework using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to classify road safety attributes defined by the iRAP standard. We introduce the first open-source dataset from ThaiRAP, consisting of over 2,000 curated street-level images from Thailand annotated for this task. We evaluate Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o-mini on this dataset and benchmark their performance against VGGNet and ResNet baselines. While VLMs underperform on spatial awareness, they generalise well to unseen classes and offer flexible prompt-based reasoning without retraining. Our results show that VLMs can serve as automatic road assessment tools when integrated with complementary data. This work is the first to explore VLMs for zero-shot infrastructure risk assessment and opens new directions for automatic, low-cost road safety mapping.

While retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as a potential solution, current medical multimodal RAG systems are unable to perform effective retrieval across heterogeneous sources. The irrelevance of retrieved reports affects the factuality of analysis, while insufficient knowledge affects the credibility of clinical decision-making. To bridge the gap, we construct MedAtlas, which includes extensive multimodal report repositories and diverse text corpora. Based on it, we present HeteroRAG, a novel framework that enhances Med-LVLMs through heterogeneous knowledge sources. The framework introduces Modality-specific CLIPs for effective report retrieval and a Multi-corpora Query Generator for dynamically constructing queries for diverse corpora. Incorporating knowledge from such multifaceted sources, Med-LVLM is then trained with Heterogeneous Knowledge Preference Tuning to achieve cross-modality and multi-source knowledge alignment. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 modalities demonstrate that the proposed HeteroRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance in most medical vision language benchmarks, significantly improving factual accuracy and reliability of Med-LVLMs.</p></details> |  |

Across 11 LLMs and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations, low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture task-specific units.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Interplay of Model Behavior and Model Internals Workshop co-located with COLM 2025</p></details> |

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have enabled recent progress in multimodal misinformation detection (MMD), the rise of generative AI (GenAI) tools introduces a new challenge: GenAI-driven news diversity, characterized by highly varied and complex content. We show that this diversity induces multi-level drift, comprising (1) model-level misperception drift, where stylistic variations disrupt a model's internal reasoning, and (2) evidence-level drift, where expression diversity degrades the quality or relevance of retrieved external evidence. These drifts significantly degrade the robustness of current LVLM-based MMD systems. To systematically study this problem, we introduce DriftBench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 16,000 news instances across six categories of diversification. We design three evaluation tasks: (1) robustness of truth verification under multi-level drift; (2) susceptibility to adversarial evidence contamination generated by GenAI; and (3) analysis of reasoning consistency across diverse inputs. Experiments with six state-of-the-art LVLM-based detectors show substantial performance drops (average F1 -14.8%) and increasingly unstable reasoning traces, with even more severe failures under adversarial evidence injection. Our findings uncover fundamental vulnerabilities in existing MMD systems and suggest an urgent need for more resilient approaches in the GenAI era.</p></details> |  |
| **[Not All Tokens and Heads Are Equally Important: Dual-Level Attention Intervention for Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12609v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse multimodal tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to visual hallucinations (VH), often producing confident but inaccurate descriptions of visual content. Building on the insight that not all tokens and attention heads contribute equally to VH mitigation, we introduce VisFlow, a lightweight and training-free framework that alleviates hallucinations by directly modulating attention patterns during inference. To address two primary challenges of VH, namely insufficient visual attention and the dominance of language priors, we identify three problematic attention behaviors in LVLMs: (1) disproportionate allocation of attention to uninformative or trailing visual tokens, (2) over-dependence on the previously generated token, and (3) excessive fixation on system prompts that hinders multimodal integration. To overcome these issues, VisFlow introduces a dual-level Attention Intervention, consisting of Token-level Attention Intervention (TAI), which reinforces attention to salient visual regions, and Head-level Attention Intervention (HAI), which suppresses undue focus on system prompts and adjacent text tokens. Together, these interventions strengthen visual alignment while reducing linguistic bias. Extensive experiments across diverse models and benchmarks demonstrate that VisFlow effectively mitigates hallucinations with minimal computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, no existing metric effectively predicts all five principles in visual art. Computationally evaluating the visual aspects of a painting requires a metric that can interpret key elements such as color, composition, and thematic choices. Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated their ability to evaluate abstract image attributes, making them promising candidates for this task. In this work, we investigate whether CLIP, pre-trained on large-scale data, can understand and predict W\"olfflin's principles. Our findings indicate that it does not inherently capture such nuanced stylistic elements. To address this, we fine-tune CLIP on annotated datasets of real art images to predict a score for each principle. We evaluate our model, WP-CLIP, on GAN-generated paintings and the Pandora-18K art dataset, demonstrating its ability to generalize across diverse artistic styles. Our results highlight the potential of VLMs for automated art analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 AI4VA workshop (oral), Code: https://github.com/abhijay9/wpclip</p></details> |

To meet these requirements, existing systems commonly employ cloud-edge collaborative architectures, such as partitioned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or task offloading strategies between Large and Small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs). However, these methods fail to accommodate cloud latency fluctuations and overlook the full potential of delayed but accurate LVLM responses. In this work, we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative paradigm for VLMs, termed Context Transfer, which treats the delayed outputs of LVLMs as historical context to provide real-time guidance for SVLMs inference. Based on this paradigm, we design SpotVLM, which incorporates both context replacement and visual focus modules to refine historical textual input and enhance visual grounding consistency. Extensive experiments on three real-time vision tasks across four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The new paradigm lays the groundwork for more effective and latency-aware collaboration strategies in future VLM systems.</p></details> |  |

Through a comprehensive investigation of manga narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these limitations. Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii) comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence, struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence, while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in Multimodal Models.

The sequential, token-by-token generation process of these models results in high inference latency and cannot perform bidirectional reasoning, making them unsuitable for dynamic, safety-critical environments. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ViLaD, a novel Large Vision Language Diffusion (LVLD) framework for end-to-end autonomous driving that represents a paradigm shift. ViLaD leverages a masked diffusion model that enables parallel generation of entire driving decision sequences, significantly reducing computational latency. Moreover, its architecture supports bidirectional reasoning, allowing the model to consider both past and future simultaneously, and supports progressive easy-first generation to iteratively improve decision quality. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, where ViLaD outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive VLM baselines in both planning accuracy and inference speed, while achieving a near-zero failure rate. Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's practical viability through a real-world deployment on an autonomous vehicle for an interactive parking task, confirming its effectiveness and soundness for practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Forward-Only Data Valuation for Pretrained LLMs and VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10180v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying the influence of individual training samples is essential for enhancing the transparency and accountability of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing data valuation methods often rely on Hessian information or model retraining, making them computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter models. In this work, we introduce For-Value, a forward-only data valuation framework that enables scalable and efficient influence estimation for both LLMs and VLMs. By leveraging the rich representations of modern foundation models, For-Value computes influence scores using a simple closed-form expression based solely on a single forward pass, thereby eliminating the need for costly gradient computations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that For-Value accurately estimates per-sample influence by capturing alignment in hidden representations and prediction errors between training and validation samples. Extensive experiments show that For-Value matches or outperforms gradient-based baselines in identifying impactful fine-tuning examples and effectively detecting mislabeled data.</p></details> |  |

However, generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images. Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction, our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Existing open-vocabulary 3D detection methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of pseudo-label generation followed by semantic alignment. While vision-language models (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of pseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision, remains commonly neglected. To address this issue, we propose a High Box Quality Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate and refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The framework comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA) Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D can serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also as a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary detection or annotation pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Chain of Continuous Thought for Latent-Space Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12587v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many reasoning techniques for large multimodal models adapt language model approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which express reasoning as word sequences. While effective for text, these methods are suboptimal for multimodal contexts, struggling to align audio, visual, and textual information dynamically. To explore an alternative paradigm, we propose the Multimodal Chain of Continuous Thought (MCOUT), which enables reasoning directly in a joint latent space rather than in natural language. In MCOUT, the reasoning state is represented as a continuous hidden vector, iteratively refined and aligned with visual and textual embeddings, inspired by human reflective cognition. We develop two variants: MCOUT-Base, which reuses the language model`s last hidden state as the continuous thought for iterative reasoning, and MCOUT-Multi, which integrates multimodal latent attention to strengthen cross-modal alignment between visual and textual features. Experiments on benchmarks including MMMU, ScienceQA, and MMStar show that MCOUT consistently improves multimodal reasoning, yielding up to 8.23% accuracy gains over strong baselines and improving BLEU scores up to 8.27% across multiple-choice and open-ended tasks. These findings highlight latent continuous reasoning as a promising direction for advancing LMMs beyond language-bound CoT, offering a scalable framework for human-like reflective multimodal inference.

While existing works approach this problem using supervised training for specific manipulation or anomaly detection in the embedding space, generalization across domains remains a challenge. We frame this problem of forgery detection as a prompt-driven visual reasoning task, leveraging the semantic alignment capabilities of large vision-language models. We propose a framework, `REVEAL` (Reasoning and Evaluation of Visual Evidence through Aligned Language), that incorporates generalized guidelines. We propose two tangential approaches - (1) Holistic Scene-level Evaluation that relies on the physics, semantics, perspective, and realism of the image as a whole and (2) Region-wise anomaly detection that splits the image into multiple regions and analyzes each of them. We conduct experiments over datasets from different domains (Photoshop, DeepFake and AIGC editing).

This study investigates these challenges by using GPT-4V, a vision-language model, not as a performance benchmark but as a diagnostic tool to reveal patterns and causes of gesture misrecognition. We analysed a public dataset of pedestrian-vehicle interactions, combining manual video review with thematic analysis of the model's qualitative reasoning. This dual approach surfaced recurring factors influencing misrecognition, including gesture visibility, pedestrian behaviour, interaction context, and environmental conditions. The findings suggest practical considerations for gesture design, including the value of salience and contextual redundancy, and highlight opportunities to improve AV recognition systems through richer context modelling and uncertainty-aware interpretations. While centred on AV-pedestrian interaction, the method and insights are applicable to other domains where machines interpret human gestures, such as wearable AR and assistive technologies.</p></details> |  |

These models typically combine a Vision Transformer (ViT) as an image encoder and a Large Language Model (LLM) for text generation. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is an efficient fine-tuning method to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks by introducing low-rank updates to their weights. While LoRA has emerged as a powerful technique for fine-tuning large models by introducing low-rank updates, current implementations assume a fixed rank, potentially limiting flexibility and efficiency across diverse tasks. This paper introduces \textit{LangVision-LoRA-NAS}, a novel framework that integrates Neural Architecture Search (NAS) with LoRA to optimize VLMs for variable-rank adaptation.

Traditional analysis of H-reflex EMG waveforms is subject to variability and interpretation bias among clinicians and researchers, limiting reliability and standardization. To address these challenges, we propose a Fine-Tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) Consortium and a reasoning Large-Language Model (LLM)-enabled Decision Support System for automated H-reflex waveform interpretation and diagnosis. Our approach leverages multiple VLMs, each fine-tuned on curated datasets of H-reflex EMG waveform images annotated with clinical observations, recovery timelines, and athlete metadata. These models are capable of extracting key electrophysiological features and predicting neuromuscular states, including fatigue, injury, and recovery, directly from EMG images and contextual metadata. Diagnostic outputs from the VLM consortium are aggregated using a consensus-based method and refined by a specialized reasoning LLM, which ensures robust, transparent, and explainable decision support for clinicians and sports scientists. The end-to-end platform orchestrates seamless communication between the VLM ensemble and the reasoning LLM, integrating prompt engineering strategies and automated reasoning workflows using LLM Agents. Experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid system delivers highly accurate, consistent, and interpretable H-reflex assessments, significantly advancing the automation and standardization of neuromuscular diagnostics. To our knowledge, this work represents the first integration of a fine-tuned VLM consortium with a reasoning LLM for image-based H-reflex analysis, laying the foundation for next-generation AI-assisted neuromuscular assessment and athlete monitoring platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[M3PO: Multimodal-Model-Guided Preference Optimization for Visual Instruction Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12458v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) hold immense potential for complex multimodal instruction following, yet their development is often hindered by the high cost and inconsistency of human annotation required for effective fine-tuning and preference alignment. Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and existing preference optimization methods like RLHF and DPO frequently struggle to efficiently leverage the model's own generation space to identify highly informative "hard negative" samples. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal-Model-Guided Preference Optimization (M3PO), a novel and data-efficient method designed to enhance LVLMs' capabilities in visual instruction following. M3PO intelligently selects the most "learning-valuable" preference sample pairs from a diverse pool of LVLM-generated candidates. This selection is driven by a sophisticated mechanism that integrates two crucial signals: a Multimodal Alignment Score (MAS) to assess external quality and the model's Self-Consistency / Confidence (log-probability) to gauge internal belief. These are combined into a novel M3P-Score, which specifically identifies preferred responses and challenging dispreferred responses that the model might confidently generate despite being incorrect. These high-quality preference pairs are then used for efficient Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fine-tuning on base LVLMs like LLaVA-1.5 (7B/13B) using LoRA. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that M3PO consistently outperforms strong baselines, including SFT, simulated RLHF, vanilla DPO, and RM-DPO, across a comprehensive suite of multimodal instruction following benchmarks (MME-Bench, POPE, IFT, Human Pref.

While deep learning models offer high diagnostic accuracy, their black-box nature hinders clinical adoption in high-stakes medical settings. To address this, we propose X-Ray-CoT (Chest X-Ray Chain-of-Thought), a novel framework leveraging Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for intelligent chest X-ray diagnosis and interpretable report generation. X-Ray-CoT simulates human radiologists' "chain-of-thought" by first extracting multi-modal features and visual concepts, then employing an LLM-based component with a structured Chain-of-Thought prompting strategy to reason and produce detailed natural language diagnostic reports. Evaluated on the CORDA dataset, X-Ray-CoT achieves competitive quantitative performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 80.52% and F1 score of 78.65% for disease diagnosis, slightly surpassing existing black-box models. Crucially, it uniquely generates high-quality, explainable reports, as validated by preliminary human evaluations. Our ablation studies confirm the integral role of each proposed component, highlighting the necessity of multi-modal fusion and CoT reasoning for robust and transparent medical AI. This work represents a significant step towards trustworthy and clinically actionable AI systems in medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training. We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations, achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring manually annotated CoTs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMAD: Integrated End-to-End Vision-Language Model for Explainable Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12404v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promising capabilities in scene understanding, enhancing the explainability of driving behaviors and interactivity with users. Existing methods primarily fine-tune VLMs on on-board multi-view images and scene reasoning text, but this approach often lacks the holistic and nuanced scene recognition and powerful spatial awareness required for autonomous driving, especially in complex situations. To address this gap, we propose a novel vision-language framework tailored for autonomous driving, called LMAD. Our framework emulates modern end-to-end driving paradigms by incorporating comprehensive scene understanding and a task-specialized structure with VLMs. In particular, we introduce preliminary scene interaction and specialized expert adapters within the same driving task structure, which better align VLMs with autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, our approach is designed to be fully compatible with existing VLMs while seamlessly integrating with planning-oriented driving systems. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM and nuScenes-QA datasets demonstrate that LMAD significantly boosts the performance of existing VLMs on driving reasoning tasks,setting a new standard in explainable autonomous driving.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures, |
| **[MPCAR: Multi-Perspective Contextual Augmentation for Enhanced Visual Reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12400v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) continue to face challenges in complex visual reasoning tasks that demand deep contextual understanding, multi-angle analysis, or meticulous detail recognition. Existing approaches often rely on single-shot image encoding and prompts, limiting their ability to fully capture nuanced visual information. Inspired by the notion that strategically generated "additional" information can serve as beneficial contextual augmentation, we propose Multi-Perspective Contextual Augmentation for Reasoning (MPCAR), a novel inference-time strategy designed to enhance LVLM performance. MPCAR operates in three stages: first, an LVLM generates N diverse and complementary descriptions or preliminary reasoning paths from various angles; second, these descriptions are intelligently integrated with the original question to construct a comprehensive context-augmented prompt; and finally, this enriched prompt guides the ultimate LVLM for deep reasoning and final answer generation. Crucially, MPCAR achieves these enhancements without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying LVLM's parameters. Extensive experiments on challenging Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, including GQA, VQA-CP v2, and ScienceQA (Image-VQA), demonstrate that MPCAR consistently outperforms established baseline methods. Our quantitative results show significant accuracy gains, particularly on tasks requiring robust contextual understanding, while human evaluations confirm improved coherence and completeness of the generated answers. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of diverse prompt templates and the number of generated perspectives. This work underscores the efficacy of leveraging LVLMs' inherent generative capabilities to enrich input contexts, thereby unlocking their latent reasoning potential for complex multimodal tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Cross-Modal Style-Aware Prompt Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12399v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has propelled vision-language models like CLIP to excel in diverse tasks, making them ideal for federated learning due to computational efficiency. However, conventional approaches that rely solely on final-layer features miss out on rich multi-scale visual cues and domain-specific style variations in decentralized client data. To bridge this gap, we introduce FedCSAP (Federated Cross-Modal Style-Aware Prompt Generation). Our framework harnesses low, mid, and high-level features from CLIP's vision encoder alongside client-specific style indicators derived from batch-level statistics. By merging intricate visual details with textual context, FedCSAP produces robust, context-aware prompt tokens that are both distinct and non-redundant, thereby boosting generalization across seen and unseen classes. Operating within a federated learning paradigm, our approach ensures data privacy through local training and global aggregation, adeptly handling non-IID class distributions and diverse domain-specific styles. Comprehensive experiments on multiple image classification datasets confirm that FedCSAP outperforms existing federated prompt learning methods in both accuracy and overall generalization.</p></details> |  |

Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage. By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10% on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[EgoLoc: A Generalizable Solution for Temporal Interaction Localization in Egocentric Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12349v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing hand-object interaction in egocentric vision facilitates VR/AR applications and human-robot policy transfer. Existing research has mostly focused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., ``how to interact''). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and the target object (i.e., ``when to interact'') is still underexplored, which is crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references, but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks. Code and relevant data will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended journal version of arXiv:2506.03662</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector for Image Forgery Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12341v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of image generation techniques, robust forgery detection has become increasingly imperative to ensure the trustworthiness of digital media. Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of pre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the misalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the model's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction learning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing discrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery feature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies to minimize redundant forgery information. Experiments conducted on two standard image forgery datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SDD, which achieves superior results compared to existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/wzy1111111/SSD.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Interpretable Oracle Bone Script Decipherment through Radical and Pictographic Analysis with LVLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10113v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity, abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability, especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10 accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly, our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Multimodal AI Reasoning for Meteorological Forecasting from Skew-T Diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12198v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting from atmospheric soundings is a fundamental task in operational meteorology, often requiring structured visual reasoning over Skew-T log-P diagrams by human forecasters. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in other scientific domains, their application to meteorological diagram interpretation remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a lightweight AI assistant that interprets Skew-T diagrams using a small language model (LM) and a small VLM fine-tuned to emulate human forecasters. Using a curriculum learning framework, we first train the models to identify key atmospheric features from diagrams through visual question answering, followed by chain-of-thought reasoning tasks that estimate precipitation probability based on the derived visual groundings. Model inputs include either textual summaries or generated Skew-T diagrams derived from operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecasts, paired with three-hour precipitation observations from South Korea's Auto Weather Stations network. Evaluation results demonstrate that the fine-tuned VLM achieves skill comparable to an operational NWP model, despite relying solely on static atmospheric profiles. Ablation studies reveal that visual grounding and reasoning supervision are critical for performance, while attention map analysis confirms that the model learns to focus on relevant meteorological features. These findings highlight the potential of compact, interpretable multimodal models to support weather forecasting tasks. The approach offers a computationally efficient alternative to large-scale systems, and future work could extend it to more complex applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 3 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

FormCoach transforms a simple camera into an always-on, interactive AI training partner, capable of spotting subtle form errors and delivering tailored corrections in real time, leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated, rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems. By framing form correction as a collaborative and creative process between humans and machines, FormCoach opens a new frontier in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, these pretrained embeddings remain suboptimal for fine-grained open-set visual retrieval, where state-of-the-art results require fine-tuning the vision encoder using annotated domain-specific samples. Naively performing such fine-tuning typically leads to catastrophic forgetting, severely diminishing the model's general-purpose visual and cross-modal capabilities. In this work, we propose a fine-tuning method explicitly designed to achieve optimal balance between fine-grained domain adaptation and retention of the pretrained VLM's broad multimodal knowledge. Drawing inspiration from continual learning literature, we systematically analyze standard regularization techniques aimed at knowledge retention and propose an efficient and effective combination strategy. Additionally, we address the commonly overlooked yet critical aspects of validation set design and hyperparameter tuning to ensure reproducibility and robust generalization across datasets and pretrained models. We extensively evaluate our method on both fine-grained and coarse-grained image-image and image-text retrieval benchmarks. Our approach consistently achieves strong results, notably retaining the visual-text alignment without utilizing any text data or the original text encoder during fine-tuning.

However, existing research centers on offline reinforcement learning training or online optimization using action-level rewards, which limits the agent's dynamic interaction with the environment. This often results in agents settling into local optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action correction. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called Mobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with task-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three stages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level reward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn trajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error correction capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance improvements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese applications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new benchmark with 500 trajectories. We will open source all resources, including the dataset, benchmark, model weight, and codes: https://mobile-r1.github.io/Mobile-R1/.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

Early BP benchmarks featured synthetic black-and-white drawings, which might not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. Subsequent BP datasets employed real-world images, albeit the represented concepts are identifiable from high-level image features, reducing the task complexity. Differently, the recently released Bongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the original BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction, however, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining evaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset composed of $5\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts using real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM) pipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually curated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying concepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and manually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended concepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations, including binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer generation. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained visual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained concepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, inspired by test-time scaling that increases inference budget and thereby improves performance, we design a candidate-conditioned answering process. The VLM first generates multiple responses per query, and then synthesizes the final answer by contextualizing these candidates. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with up to 15.50 points accuracy gain over the initial VLM, in a fully self-improving paradigm without either human-labeled data or external models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CIKM 2025</p></details> |

However, current approaches face two key challenges: reliance on large spatial tiles that increase computational cost, and dependence on text-based supervision, which is often not readily available. In this work, we present TimeSenCLIP, a lightweight framework that reevaluate the role of spatial context by evaluating the effectiveness of a single pixel by leveraging its temporal and spectral dimensions, for classifying LULC and ecosystem types. By leveraging spectral and temporal information from Sentinel-2 imagery and cross-view learning with geo-tagged ground-level photos, we minimises the need for caption-based training while preserving semantic alignment between overhead (satellite) and ground perspectives. Our approach is grounded in the LUCAS and Sen4Map datasets, and evaluated on classification tasks including LULC, crop type, and ecosystem type. We demonstrate that single pixel inputs, when combined with temporal and spectral cues, are sufficient for thematic mapping, offering a scalable and efficient alternative for large-scale remote sensing applications.

This evolution requires robots to not only interpret high-level instructions and plan tasks but also perceive and adapt within dynamic environments. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) present a promising solution by combining visual understanding and language reasoning. However, existing VLM-based methods struggle with interactive exploration, accurate perception, and real-time plan adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose ExploreVLM, a novel closed-loop task planning framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The framework is built around a step-wise feedback mechanism that enables real-time plan adjustment and supports interactive exploration. At its core is a dual-stage task planner with self-reflection, enhanced by an object-centric spatial relation graph that provides structured, language-grounded scene representations to guide perception and planning. An execution validator supports the closed loop by verifying each action and triggering re-planning. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that ExploreVLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in exploration-centric tasks. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of the reflective planner and structured perception in achieving robust and efficient task execution.</p></details> |  |

In this paradigm, only the inserted adapters are fine-tuned, without the need for training the original VLM backbone. Existing works scale adapters by integrating them into every layer of VLMs to increase the capacity of adapters. However, these methods face two primary limitations: 1) limited compression rate due to ignoring cross-layer redundancy, and 2) limited representational capacity across homogeneous adapters. In this paper, we propose a novel vision-language fine-tuning framework based on cross-layer tensor ring decomposition (TRD) with the integration and collaboration of diverse adapters, called AdaRing, achieving ultra-light parameter-efficient adaptation of VLMs on various tasks. To remove the high redundancy that exists among adapters across layers, we exploit the tensor-level low-rankness to formulate adapters as layer-shared tensor cores and layer-specific slices. Moreover, guided by generalization-aware fine-tuning, diverse rank-driven adapters cooperate to handle tasks that require different representations. Our experiments show that the proposed AdaRing achieves the state-of-the-art performance while reducing average training parameters by 90%.</p></details> |  |

Rethinking Augmentation in Multimodal Hate Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11808v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The modern web is saturated with multimodal content, intensifying the challenge of detecting hateful memes, where harmful intent is often conveyed through subtle interactions between text and image under the guise of humor or satire. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, these models lack support for fine-grained supervision and remain susceptible to implicit hate speech. In this paper, we present a dual-pronged approach to improve multimodal hate detection. First, we propose a prompt optimization framework that systematically varies prompt structure, supervision granularity, and training modality. We show that prompt design and label scaling both influence performance, with structured prompts improving robustness even in small models, and InternVL2 achieving the best F1-scores across binary and scaled settings. Second, we introduce a multimodal data augmentation pipeline that generates 2,479 counterfactually neutral memes by isolating and rewriting the hateful modality. This pipeline, powered by a multi-agent LLM-VLM setup, successfully reduces spurious correlations and improves classifier generalization. Our approaches inspire new directions for building synthetic data to train robust and fair vision-language models. Our findings demonstrate that prompt structure and data composition are as critical as model size, and that targeted augmentation can support more trustworthy and context-sensitive hate detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, existing AVE datasets are primarily limited to text-to-text or image-to-text settings, lacking support for product videos, diverse attribute coverage, and public availability. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoAVE, the first publicly available video-to-text e-commerce AVE dataset across 14 different domains and covering 172 unique attributes. To ensure data quality, we propose a post-hoc CLIP-based Mixture of Experts filtering system (CLIP-MoE) to remove the mismatched video-product pairs, resulting in a refined dataset of 224k training data and 25k evaluation data. In order to evaluate the usability of the dataset, we further establish a comprehensive benchmark by evaluating several state-of-the-art video vision language models (VLMs) under both attribute-conditioned value prediction and open attribute-value pair extraction tasks. Our results analysis reveals that video-to-text AVE remains a challenging problem, particularly in open settings, and there is still room for developing more advanced VLMs capable of leveraging effective temporal information.

Previous approaches leverage large vision language models (LVLMs) to encode object semantics into <SEG> tokens for mask prediction. However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inference and suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawing inspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduce Veason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning in segmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, we curate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoning trajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding, yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPO fine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space by optimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic reward mechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporal consistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art by significant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &F in ReasonVOS), while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R).

Existing end-to-end policies overfit small simulator datasets, achieving high success on training scenes but failing to generalize and exhibiting unsafe behaviour (frequent collisions). We introduce OVSegDT, a lightweight transformer policy that tackles these issues with two synergistic components. The first component is the semantic branch, which includes an encoder for the target binary mask and an auxiliary segmentation loss function, grounding the textual goal and providing precise spatial cues. The second component consists of a proposed Entropy-Adaptive Loss Modulation, a per-sample scheduler that continuously balances imitation and reinforcement signals according to the policy entropy, eliminating brittle manual phase switches. These additions cut the sample complexity of training by 33%, and reduce collision count in two times while keeping inference cost low (130M parameters, RGB-only input). On HM3D-OVON, our model matches the performance on unseen categories to that on seen ones and establishes state-of-the-art results (40.1% SR, 20.9% SPL on val unseen) without depth, odometry, or large vision-language models.

In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document interpretation. In a comprehensive evaluation across 42 public benchmarks, GLM-4.5V achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks among open-source models of similar size, and demonstrates competitive or even superior results compared to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on challenging tasks including Coding and GUI Agents. Meanwhile, the smaller GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking remains highly competitive-achieving superior results to the much larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B on 29 benchmarks. We open-source both GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and GLM-4.5V. Code, models and more information are released at https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-V.</p></details> |  |

We present Med3DVLM, a 3D VLM designed to address these challenges through three key innovations: (1) DCFormer, an efficient encoder that uses decomposed 3D convolutions to capture fine-grained spatial features at scale; (2) SigLIP, a contrastive learning strategy with pairwise sigmoid loss that improves image-text alignment without relying on large negative batches; and (3) a dual-stream MLP-Mixer projector that fuses low- and high-level image features with text embeddings for richer multi-modal representations. We evaluate our model on the M3D dataset, which includes radiology reports and VQA data for 120,084 3D medical images. Results show that Med3DVLM achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks. For image-text retrieval, it reaches 61.00% R@1 on 2,000 samples, significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art M3D model (19.10%). For report generation, it achieves a METEOR score of 36.42% (vs. 14.38%). In open-ended visual question answering (VQA), it scores 36.76% METEOR (vs. 33.58%), and in closed-ended VQA, it achieves 79.95% accuracy (vs. 75.78%). These results highlight Med3DVLM's ability to bridge the gap between 3D imaging and language, enabling scalable, multi-task reasoning across clinical applications.

| **[ImagiDrive: A Unified Imagination-and-Planning Framework for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11428v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving requires rich contextual comprehension and precise predictive reasoning to navigate dynamic and complex environments safely. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Driving World Models (DWMs) have independently emerged as powerful recipes addressing different aspects of this challenge. VLMs provide interpretability and robust action prediction through their ability to understand multi-modal context, while DWMs excel in generating detailed and plausible future driving scenarios essential for proactive planning. Integrating VLMs with DWMs is an intuitive, promising, yet understudied strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of accurate behavioral prediction and realistic scene generation. Nevertheless, this integration presents notable challenges, particularly in effectively connecting action-level decisions with high-fidelity pixel-level predictions and maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose ImagiDrive, a novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that integrates a VLM-based driving agent with a DWM-based scene imaginer to form a unified imagination-and-planning loop. The driving agent predicts initial driving trajectories based on multi-modal inputs, guiding the scene imaginer to generate corresponding future scenarios. These imagined scenarios are subsequently utilized to iteratively refine the driving agent's planning decisions. To address efficiency and predictive accuracy challenges inherent in this integration, we introduce an early stopping mechanism and a trajectory selection strategy. Extensive experimental validation on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrates the robustness and superiority of ImagiDrive over previous alternatives under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and code are available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>we up...</summary><p>we update the paper, add more experiments, and update the teammates</p></details> |

This target label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model to predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model predictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability, reproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided framework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge transfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity sources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect to the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our experiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these models consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static lexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class relationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \textit{a priori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models for constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial benchmarks across architectures and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Noise Matters: Optimizing Matching Noise for Diffusion Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11330v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image classification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious bias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising effects with different category conditions to classify categories. Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles, we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good) noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of NoOp.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logic Unseen: Revealing the Logical Blindspots of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11317v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical ''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications. To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance, particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality, highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM logical capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-Language Models display a strong gender bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11262v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLM) align images and text in a shared representation space that is useful for retrieval and zero-shot transfer. Yet, this alignment can encode and amplify social stereotypes in subtle ways that are not obvious from standard accuracy metrics. In this study, we test whether the contrastive vision-language encoder exhibits gender-linked associations when it places embeddings of face images near embeddings of short phrases that describe occupations and activities. We assemble a dataset of 220 face photographs split by perceived binary gender and a set of 150 unique statements distributed across six categories covering emotional labor, cognitive labor, domestic labor, technical labor, professional roles, and physical labor. We compute unit-norm image embeddings for every face and unit-norm text embeddings for every statement, then define a statement-level association score as the difference between the mean cosine similarity to the male set and the mean cosine similarity to the female set, where positive values indicate stronger association with the male set and negative values indicate stronger association with the female set. We attach bootstrap confidence intervals by resampling images within each gender group, aggregate by category with a separate bootstrap over statements, and run a label-swap null model that estimates the level of mean absolute association we would expect if no gender structure were present. The outcome is a statement-wise and category-wise map of gender associations in a contrastive vision-language space, accompanied by uncertainty, simple sanity checks, and a robust gender bias evaluation framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Decoupled Learning for Enhancing Open-Vocabulary Dense Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11256v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense visual perception tasks have been constrained by their reliance on predefined categories, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where visual concepts are unbounded. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to dense perception often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features respectively. \revise{The context features are enhanced by jointly distilling semantic correlations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and object integrity cues from diffusion models, thereby enhancing spatial consistency. In parallel, the content features are aligned with image crop representations and constrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP establishes a solid foundation for open-vocabulary dense perception, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, including 2D detection and segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D object pose estimation.} Code is available at https://github.com/xiaomoguhz/DeCLIP</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2505.04410</p></details> |
| **[Compositional Zero-shot Learning via Progressive Language-based Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14749v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional zero-shot learning aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by leveraging known primitives (state and object) during training. However, effectively modeling interactions between primitives and generalizing knowledge to novel compositions remains a perennial challenge. There are two key factors: object-conditioned and state-conditioned variance, i.e., the appearance of states (or objects) can vary significantly when combined with different objects (or states). For instance, the state "old" can signify a vintage design for a "car" or an advanced age for a "cat". In this paper, we argue that these variances can be mitigated by predicting composition categories based on pre-observed primitive. To this end, we propose Progressive Language-based Observations (PLO), which can dynamically determine a better observation order of primitives. These observations comprise a series of concepts or languages that allow the model to understand image content in a step-by-step manner. Specifically, PLO adopts pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to empower the model with observation capabilities. We further devise two variants: 1) PLO-VLM: a two-step method, where a pre-observing classifier dynamically determines the observation order of two primitives. 2) PLO-LLM: a multi-step scheme, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to craft composition-specific prompts for step-by-step observing. Extensive ablations on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of PLO compared with state-of-the-art methods, affirming its abilities in compositional recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[MUNBa: Machine Unlearning via Nash Bargaining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15537v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to selectively erase harmful behaviors from models while retaining the overall utility of the model. As a multi-task learning problem, MU involves balancing objectives related to forgetting specific concepts/data and preserving general performance. A naive integration of these forgetting and preserving objectives can lead to gradient conflicts and dominance, impeding MU algorithms from reaching optimal solutions. To address the gradient conflict and dominance issue, we reformulate MU as a two-player cooperative game, where the two players, namely, the forgetting player and the preservation player, contribute via their gradient proposals to maximize their overall gain and balance their contributions. To this end, inspired by the Nash bargaining theory, we derive a closed-form solution to guide the model toward the Pareto stationary point. Our formulation of MU guarantees an equilibrium solution, where any deviation from the final state would lead to a reduction in the overall objectives for both players, ensuring optimality in each objective. We evaluate our algorithm's effectiveness on a diverse set of tasks across image classification and image generation. Extensive experiments with ResNet, vision-language model CLIP, and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MU algorithms, achieving a better trade-off between forgetting and preserving. Our results also highlight improvements in forgetting precision, preservation of generalization, and robustness against adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[UAV-VL-R1: Generalizing Vision-Language Models via Supervised Fine-Tuning and Multi-Stage GRPO for UAV Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11196v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization in natural image tasks. However, their performance often degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints. These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting, transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained VLM Fine-tuning via Latent Hierarchical Adapter Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11176v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapter-based approaches have garnered attention for fine-tuning pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on few-shot classification tasks. These methods strive to develop a lightweight module that better aligns visual and (category) textual representations, thereby enhancing performance on downstream few-shot learning tasks. However, existing adapters generally learn/align (category) textual-visual modalities via explicit spatial proximity in the underlying embedding space, which i) fails to capture the inherent one-to-many associations between categories and image samples and ii) struggles to establish accurate associations between the unknown categories and images. To address these issues, inspired by recent works on hyperbolic learning, we develop a novel Latent Hierarchical Adapter (LatHAdapter) for fine-tuning VLMs on downstream few-shot classification tasks. The core of LatHAdapter is to exploit the latent semantic hierarchy of downstream training data and employ it to provide richer, fine-grained guidance for the adapter learning process. Specifically, LatHAdapter first introduces some learnable `attribute' prompts as the bridge to align categories and images. Then, it projects the categories, attribute prompts, and images within each batch in a hyperbolic space, and employs hierarchical regularization to learn the latent semantic hierarchy of them, thereby fully modeling the inherent one-to-many associations among categories, learnable attributes, and image samples. Extensive experiments on four challenging few-shot tasks show that the proposed LatHAdapter consistently outperforms many other fine-tuning approaches, particularly in adapting known classes and generalizing to unknown classes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods face challenges when doctors need to interact through natural language or when position reasoning is required - understanding spatial relationships between anatomical structures and pathologies. We present PRS-Med, a framework that integrates vision-language models with segmentation capabilities to generate both accurate segmentation masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. Additionally, we introduce the MMRS dataset (Multimodal Medical in Positional Reasoning Segmentation), which provides diverse, spatially-grounded question-answer pairs to address the lack of position reasoning data in medical imaging. PRS-Med demonstrates superior performance across six imaging modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, ultrasound, endoscopy, RGB), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both segmentation accuracy and position reasoning. Our approach enables intuitive doctor-system interaction through natural language, facilitating more efficient diagnoses. Our dataset pipeline, model, and codebase will be released to foster further research in spatially-aware multimodal reasoning for medical applications.</p></details> |  |

A good explanation highlights if a model depends on spurious features that undermines generalization and harms a subset of patients or, conversely, may present novel biological insights. Although techniques like GradCAM can identify influential features, they are measurement tools that do not themselves form an explanation. We propose a human-machine-VLM interaction system tailored to explaining classifiers in computational pathology, including multi-instance learning for whole-slide images. Our proof of concept comprises (1) an AI-integrated slide viewer to run sliding-window experiments to test claims of an explanation, and (2) quantification of an explanation's predictiveness using general-purpose vision-language models. The results demonstrate that this allows us to qualitatively test claims of explanations and can quantifiably distinguish competing explanations. This offers a practical path from explainable AI to explained AI in digital pathology and beyond.

| **[Better Supervised Fine-tuning for VQA: Integer-Only Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11170v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of vision language models(VLM), their ability to assess visual content based on specific criteria and dimensions has become increasingly critical for applications such as video-theme consistency assessment and visual quality scoring. However, existing methods often suffer from imprecise results and inefficient loss calculation, which limit the focus of the model on key evaluation indicators. To address this, we propose IOVQA(Integer-only VQA), a novel fine-tuning approach tailored for VLMs to enhance their performance in video quality assessment tasks. The key innovation of IOVQA lies in its label construction and its targeted loss calculation mechanism. Specifically, during dataset curation, we constrain the model's output to integers within the range of [10,50], ensuring numerical stability, and convert decimal Overall_MOS to integer before using them as labels. We also introduce a target-mask strategy: when computing the loss, only the first two-digit-integer of the label is unmasked, forcing the model to learn the critical components of the numerical evaluation. After fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-VL model using the constructed dataset, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the model's accuracy and consistency in the VQA task, ranking 3rd in VQualA 2025 GenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge -- Track I. Our work highlights the effectiveness of merely leaving integer labels during fine-tuning, providing an effective idea for optimizing VLMs in quantitative evaluation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Our recent work introduced GUIDER, our framework for inferring navigation and manipulation intents. We propose augmenting GUIDER with a vision-language model (VLM) and a text-only language model (LLM) to form a semantic prior that filters objects and locations based on the mission prompt. A vision pipeline (YOLO for object detection and the Segment Anything Model for instance segmentation) feeds candidate object crops into the VLM, which scores their relevance given an operator prompt; in addition, the list of detected object labels is ranked by a text-only LLM. These scores weight the existing navigation and manipulation layers of GUIDER, selecting context-relevant targets while suppressing unrelated objects. Once the combined belief exceeds a threshold, autonomy changes occur, enabling the robot to navigate to the desired area and retrieve the desired object, while adapting to any changes in the operator's intent. Future work will evaluate the system on Isaac Sim using a Franka Emika arm on a Ridgeback base, with a focus on real-time assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Human-Centered Robot Autonomy for Human-Robot Teams (HuRoboT) at IEEE RO-MAN 2025, Eindhoven, the Netherlands</p></details> |
| **[Prototype-Guided Diffusion: Visual Conditioning without External Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09922v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework for high-quality image generation, offering stable training and strong performance across diverse domains. However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly during the iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusion alleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, though at the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such as Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioning denoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. While effective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage and retrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP for similarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the Prototype Diffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directly into the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning - without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDM constructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image features using contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps by aligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns, enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments show that PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational and storage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-based conditioning in diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Large Pre-trained Vision Language Models Effective Construction Safety Inspectors?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11011v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector identifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting safety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open datasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction safety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets, limiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques, providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.</p></details> |  |

As their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities, limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites; (3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA (GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation.

In this paper, we evaluate the extent to which VLMs can simulate the vision perception of low vision individuals when interpreting images. We first compile a benchmark dataset through a survey study with 40 low vision participants, collecting their brief and detailed vision information and both open-ended and multiple-choice image perception and recognition responses to up to 25 images. Using these responses, we construct prompts for VLMs (GPT-4o) to create simulated agents of each participant, varying the included information on vision information and example image responses. We evaluate the agreement between VLM-generated responses and participants' original answers. Our results indicate that VLMs tend to infer beyond the specified vision ability when given minimal prompts, resulting in low agreement (0.59). The agreement between the agent' and participants' responses remains low when only either the vision information (0.59) or example image responses (0.59) are provided, whereas a combination of both significantly increase the agreement (0.70, p < 0.0001). Notably, a single example combining both open-ended and multiple-choice responses, offers significant performance improvements over either alone (p < 0.0001), while additional examples provided minimal benefits (p > 0.05).</p></details> |  |

However, existing evaluation benchmarks are disconnected from the real world and fail to adequately address the diverse and complex requirements of users. From our extensive collection of user questionnaire, we identified five tasks: Multi-App, Vague, Interactive, Single-App, and Unethical Instructions. Around these tasks, we present \textbf{MVISU-Bench}, a bilingual benchmark that includes 404 tasks across 137 mobile applications. Furthermore, we propose Aider, a plug-and-play module that acts as a dynamic prompt prompter to mitigate risks and clarify user intent for mobile agents. Our Aider is easy to integrate into several frameworks and has successfully improved overall success rates by 19.55\% compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVISU-Bench. Specifically, it achieves success rate improvements of 53.52\% and 29.41\% for unethical and interactive instructions, respectively. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we highlight the gap between existing mobile agents and real-world user expectations.</p></details> | ACM MM 2025 |
| **[AEGIS: Authenticity Evaluation Benchmark for AI-Generated Video Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10771v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity, failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse, state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion, CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats.

| **[From Diagnosis to Improvement: Probing Spatio-Physical Reasoning in Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10770v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding, their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs, revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task. Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning. To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[IAD-R1: Reinforcing Consistent Reasoning in Industrial Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09178v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial anomaly detection is a critical component of modern manufacturing, yet the scarcity of defective samples restricts traditional detection methods to scenario-specific applications. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate significant advantages in generalization capabilities, their performance in industrial anomaly detection remains limited. To address this challenge, we propose IAD-R1, a universal post-training framework applicable to VLMs of different architectures and parameter scales, which substantially enhances their anomaly detection capabilities. IAD-R1 employs a two-stage training strategy: the Perception Activation Supervised Fine-Tuning (PA-SFT) stage utilizes a meticulously constructed high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset (Expert-AD) for training, enhancing anomaly perception capabilities and establishing reasoning-to-answer correlations; the Structured Control Group Relative Policy Optimization (SC-GRPO) stage employs carefully designed reward functions to achieve a capability leap from "Anomaly Perception" to "Anomaly Interpretation". Experimental results demonstrate that IAD-R1 achieves significant improvements across 7 VLMs, the largest improvement was on the DAGM dataset, with average accuracy 43.3% higher than the 0.5B baseline. Notably, the 0.5B parameter model trained with IAD-R1 surpasses commercial models including GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-4 in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of IAD-R1. The dataset, code, and all model weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/Yanhui-Lee/IAD-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[IADGPT: Unified LVLM for Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection, Localization, and Reasoning via In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10681v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across 400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in camera-ready.</p></details> |  |

The existing methods can be categorized into Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM)-based and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based methods. However, the former were susceptible to hallucinations, while the latter struggled for inter-modal disconnection and cross-page fragmentation. To address these challenges, a novel multi-modal RAG model, named MMRAG-DocQA, was proposed, leveraging both textual and visual information across long-range pages to facilitate accurate question answering. A hierarchical indexing method with the integration of flattened in-page chunks and topological cross-page chunks was designed to jointly establish in-page multi-modal associations and long-distance cross-page dependencies. By means of joint similarity evaluation and large language model (LLM)-based re-ranking, a multi-granularity semantic retrieval method, including the page-level parent page retrieval and document-level summary retrieval, was proposed to foster multi-modal evidence connection and long-distance evidence integration and reasoning. Experimental results performed on public datasets, MMLongBench-Doc and LongDocURL, demonstrated the superiority of our MMRAG-DocQA method in understanding and answering modality-rich and multi-page documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: Removed the footnote in page 1</p></details> |
| **[AddressVLM: Cross-view Alignment Tuning for Image Address Localization using Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10667v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation of Cultural Competence of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22793v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vision-language models (VLMs) often fail at cultural competency evaluations and benchmarks. Given the diversity of applications built upon VLMs, there is renewed interest in understanding how they encode cultural nuances. While individual aspects of this problem have been studied, we still lack a comprehensive framework for systematically identifying and annotating the nuanced cultural dimensions present in images for VLMs. This position paper argues that foundational methodologies from visual culture studies (cultural studies, semiotics, and visual studies) are necessary for cultural analysis of images. Building upon this review, we propose a set of five frameworks, corresponding to cultural dimensions, that must be considered for a more complete analysis of the cultural competencies of VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SemPT: Semantic Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10645v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot learning.</p></details> |  |
