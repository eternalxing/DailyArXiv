| **[Annotation-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation for Remote-Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18067v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp, a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images, where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and open-world Earth observation.</p></details> | <details><summary>All c...</summary><p>All codes and models will be released at https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-OV-2</p></details> |
| **[CitySeg: A 3D Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation Foundation Model in City-scale Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09470v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds is a critical technology for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perception systems, enabling the classification of 3D points without relying on any visual information to achieve comprehensive 3D understanding. However, existing models are frequently constrained by the limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual information.</p></details> |  |
| **[SynSeg: Feature Synergy for Multi-Category Contrastive Learning in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06115v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories. Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS). Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance, SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Free Class Purification for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00557v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However, the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS. Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance. However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity. The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP, as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when combined with other OVSS methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[OpenSeg-R: Improving Open-Vocabulary Segmentation via Step-by-Step Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16974v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) has drawn increasing attention for its capacity to generalize segmentation beyond predefined categories. However, existing methods typically predict segmentation masks with simple forward inference, lacking explicit reasoning and interpretability. This makes it challenging for OVS model to distinguish similar categories in open-world settings due to the lack of contextual understanding and discriminative visual cues. To address this limitation, we propose a step-by-step visual reasoning framework for open-vocabulary segmentation, named OpenSeg-R. The proposed OpenSeg-R leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to perform hierarchical visual reasoning before segmentation. Specifically, we generate both generic and image-specific reasoning for each image, forming structured triplets that explain the visual reason for objects in a coarse-to-fine manner. Based on these reasoning steps, we can compose detailed description prompts, and feed them to the segmentor to produce more accurate segmentation masks. To the best of our knowledge, OpenSeg-R is the first framework to introduce explicit step-by-step visual reasoning into OVS. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenSeg-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across five benchmark datasets. Moreover, it achieves consistent gains across all metrics on open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Qualitative results further highlight the effectiveness of our reasoning-guided framework in improving both segmentation precision and interpretability. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Hanzy1996/OpenSeg-R.</p></details> |  |
| **[CorrCLIP: Reconstructing Patch Correlations in CLIP for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10086v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to each pixel without being constrained by a predefined set of categories. While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in zero-shot classification, it struggles to align image patches with category embeddings because of its incoherent patch correlations. This study reveals that inter-class correlations are the main reason for impairing CLIP's segmentation performance. Accordingly, we propose CorrCLIP, which reconstructs the scope and value of patch correlations. Specifically, CorrCLIP leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to define the scope of patch interactions, reducing inter-class correlations. To mitigate the problem that SAM-generated masks may contain patches belonging to different classes, CorrCLIP incorporates self-supervised models to compute coherent similarity values, suppressing the weight of inter-class correlations. Additionally, we introduce two additional branches to strengthen patch features' spatial details and semantic representation. Finally, we update segmentation maps with SAM-generated masks to improve spatial consistency. Based on the improvement across patch correlations, feature representations, and segmentation maps, CorrCLIP achieves superior performance across eight benchmarks. Codes are available at: https://github.com/zdk258/CorrCLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 Oral</p></details> |
| **[FLOSS: Free Lunch in Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10487v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we challenge the conventional practice in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) of using averaged class-wise text embeddings, which are typically obtained by encoding each class name with multiple templates (e.g., a photo of <class>, a sketch of a <class>). We investigate the impact of templates for OVSS, and find that for each class, there exist single-template classifiers--which we refer to as class-experts--that significantly outperform the conventional averaged classifier. First, to identify these class-experts, we introduce a novel approach that estimates them without any labeled data or training. By leveraging the class-wise prediction entropy of single-template classifiers, we select those yielding the lowest entropy as the most reliable class-experts. Second, we combine the outputs of class-experts in a new fusion process. Our plug-and-play method, coined FLOSS, is orthogonal and complementary to existing OVSS methods, offering an improvement without the need for additional labels or training. Extensive experiments show that FLOSS consistently enhances state-of-the-art OVSS models, generalizes well across datasets with different distribution shifts, and delivers substantial improvements in low-data scenarios where only a few unlabeled images are available. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/FLOSS .</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025; Project Page: https://yasserben.github.io/FLOSS/</p></details> |
| **[FA-Seg: A Fast and Accurate Diffusion-Based Method for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23323v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets. Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the computation costs and the quality of the segmentation mask. In this work, we present FA-Seg, a Fast and Accurate training-free framework for open-vocabulary segmentation based on diffusion models. FA-Seg performs segmentation using only a (1+1)-step from a pretrained diffusion model. Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FA-Seg performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the segmentation quality, FA-Seg introduces three key components: (i) a dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction, (ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances semantic precision via multi-resolution attention fusion, and (iii) a Test-Time Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive experiments show that FA-Seg achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our results demonstrate that FA-Seg provides a strong foundation for extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference efficiency. The source code will be open-sourced after this paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized OVSS: Understanding Personal Concept in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11030v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) can segment an image into semantic regions based on arbitrarily given text descriptions even for classes unseen during training, it fails to understand personal texts (e.g., `my mug cup') for segmenting regions of specific interest to users. This paper addresses challenges like recognizing `my mug cup' among `multiple mug cups'. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel task termed \textit{personalized open-vocabulary semantic segmentation} and propose a text prompt tuning-based plug-in method designed to recognize personal visual concepts using a few pairs of images and masks, while maintaining the performance of the original OVSS. Based on the observation that reducing false predictions is essential when applying text prompt tuning to this task, our proposed method employs `negative mask proposal' that captures visual concepts other than the personalized concept. We further improve the performance by enriching the representation of text prompts by injecting visual embeddings of the personal concept into them. This approach enhances personalized OVSS without compromising the original OVSS performance. We demonstrate the superiority of our method on our newly established benchmarks for this task, including FSS$^\text{per}$, CUB$^\text{per}$, and ADE$^\text{per}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025; 15 pages</p></details> |
| **[Beyond-Labels: Advancing Open-Vocabulary Segmentation With Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16769v5)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation attempts to classify and outline objects in an image using arbitrary text labels, including those unseen during training. Self-supervised learning resolves numerous visual and linguistic processing problems when effectively trained. This study investigates simple yet efficient methods for adapting previously learned foundation models for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks. Our research proposes "Beyond-Labels", a lightweight transformer-based fusion module that uses a small amount of image segmentation data to fuse frozen visual representations with language concepts. This strategy allows the model to leverage the extensive knowledge of pre-trained models without requiring significant retraining, making the approach data-efficient and scalable. Furthermore, we capture positional information in images using Fourier embeddings, improving generalization and enabling smooth and consistent spatial encoding. We perform thorough ablation studies to examine the main components of our proposed method. On the standard benchmark PASCAL-5i, the method performs better despite being trained on frozen vision and language representations. Index Terms: Beyond-Labels, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, Fourier embeddings, PASCAL-5i</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 17th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[RadZero: Similarity-Based Cross-Attention for Explainable Vision-Language Alignment in Radiology with Zero-Shot Multi-Task Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07416v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multi-modal models have significantly improved vision-language (VL) alignment in radiology. However, existing approaches struggle to effectively utilize complex radiology reports for learning and offer limited interpretability through attention probability visualizations. To address these challenges, we introduce RadZero, a novel framework for VL alignment in radiology with zero-shot multi-task capability. A key component of our approach is VL-CABS (Vision-Language Cross-Attention Based on Similarity), which aligns text embeddings with local image features for interpretable, fine-grained VL reasoning. RadZero leverages large language models to extract concise semantic sentences from radiology reports and employs multi-positive contrastive training to effectively capture relationships between images and multiple relevant textual descriptions. It uses a pre-trained vision encoder with additional trainable Transformer layers, allowing efficient high-resolution image processing. By computing similarity between text embeddings and local image patch features, VL-CABS enables zero-shot inference with similarity probability for classification, and pixel-level VL similarity maps for grounding and segmentation. Experimental results on public chest radiograph benchmarks show that RadZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation. Furthermore, VL similarity map analysis highlights the potential of VL-CABS for improving explainability in VL alignment. Additionally, qualitative evaluation demonstrates RadZero's capability for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness in medical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Image Augmentation for Semantic Segmentation in Outdoor Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00153v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of leaning-based perception algorithms suffer when deployed in out-of-distribution and underrepresented environments. Outdoor robots are particularly susceptible to rapid changes in visual scene appearance due to dynamic lighting, seasonality and weather effects that lead to scenes underrepresented in the training data of the learning-based perception system. In this conceptual paper, we focus on preparing our autonomous vehicle for deployment in snow-filled environments. We propose a novel method for diffusion-based image augmentation to more closely represent the deployment environment in our training data. Diffusion-based image augmentations rely on the public availability of vision foundation models learned on internet-scale datasets. The diffusion-based image augmentations allow us to take control over the semantic distribution of the ground surfaces in the training data and to fine-tune our model for its deployment environment. We employ open vocabulary semantic segmentation models to filter out augmentation candidates that contain hallucinations. We believe that diffusion-based image augmentations can be extended to many other environments apart from snow surfaces, like sandy environments and volcanic terrains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 IEEE ICRA Workshop on Field Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing the Multi-View Fusion Potential: Noise Correction in VLM for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22817v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding approaches mainly focus on training 3D networks through contrastive learning with point-text pairs or by distilling 2D features into 3D models via point-pixel alignment. While these methods show considerable performance in benchmarks with limited vocabularies, they struggle to handle diverse object categories as the limited amount of 3D data upbound training strong open-vocabulary 3d models. We observe that 2D multi-view fusion methods take precedence in understanding diverse concepts in 3D scenes. However, inherent noises in vision-language models lead multi-view fusion to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we introduce MVOV3D, a novel approach aimed at unleashing the potential of 2D multi-view fusion for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. We focus on reducing the inherent noises without training, thereby preserving the generalizability while enhancing open-world capabilities. Specifically, MVOV3D improves multi-view 2D features by leveraging precise region-level image features and text features encoded by CLIP encoders and incorporates 3D geometric priors to optimize multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, our MVOV3D achieves a new record with 14.7% mIoU on ScanNet200 and 16.2% mIoU on Matterport160 for challenge open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, outperforming current leading trained 3D networks by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReME: A Data-Centric Framework for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21233v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets. In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing OVS without training.

| **[LPOSS: Label Propagation Over Patches and Pixels for Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19777v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a training-free method for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation using Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs). Our approach enhances the initial per-patch predictions of VLMs through label propagation, which jointly optimizes predictions by incorporating patch-to-patch relationships. Since VLMs are primarily optimized for cross-modal alignment and not for intra-modal similarity, we use a Vision Model (VM) that is observed to better capture these relationships. We address resolution limitations inherent to patch-based encoders by applying label propagation at the pixel level as a refinement step, significantly improving segmentation accuracy near class boundaries. Our method, called LPOSS+, performs inference over the entire image, avoiding window-based processing and thereby capturing contextual interactions across the full image. LPOSS+ achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free methods, across a diverse set of datasets. Code: https://github.com/vladan-stojnic/LPOSS</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Depth and Language for Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09881v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) and domain generalization in semantic segmentation (DGSS) highlight a subtle complementarity that motivates Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (OV-DGSS). OV-DGSS aims to generate pixel-level masks for unseen categories while maintaining robustness across unseen domains, a critical capability for real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We introduce Vireo, a novel single-stage framework for OV-DGSS that unifies the strengths of OVSS and DGSS for the first time. Vireo builds upon the frozen Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) and incorporates scene geometry via Depth VFMs to extract domain-invariant structural features. To bridge the gap between visual and textual modalities under domain shift, we propose three key components: (1) GeoText Prompts, which align geometric features with language cues and progressively refine VFM encoder representations; (2) Coarse Mask Prior Embedding (CMPE) for enhancing gradient flow for faster convergence and stronger textual influence; and (3) the Domain-Open-Vocabulary Vector Embedding Head (DOV-VEH), which fuses refined structural and semantic features for robust prediction. Comprehensive evaluation on these components demonstrates the effectiveness of our designs. Our proposed Vireo achieves the state-of-the-art performance and surpasses existing methods by a large margin in both domain generalization and open-vocabulary recognition, offering a unified and scalable solution for robust visual understanding in diverse and dynamic environments. Code is available at https://github.com/anonymouse-9c53tp182bvz/Vireo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-time Contrastive Concepts for Open-world Semantic Segmentation with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05061v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent CLIP-like Vision-Language Models (VLMs), pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs to align both modalities with a simple contrastive objective, have paved the way to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Given an arbitrary set of textual queries, image pixels are assigned the closest query in feature space. However, this works well when a user exhaustively lists all possible visual concepts in an image that contrast against each other for the assignment. This corresponds to the current evaluation setup in the literature, which relies on having access to a list of in-domain relevant concepts, typically classes of a benchmark dataset. Here, we consider the more challenging (and realistic) scenario of segmenting a single concept, given a textual prompt and nothing else. To achieve good results, besides contrasting with the generic 'background' text, we propose two different approaches to automatically generate, at test time, query-specific textual contrastive concepts. We do so by leveraging the distribution of text in the VLM's training set or crafted LLM prompts. We also propose a metric designed to evaluate this scenario and show the relevance of our approach on commonly used datasets.</p></details> | TMLR camera-ready |

We assess state-of-the-art OVSS models on the proposed benchmark and investigate the key factors that impact the performance of zero-shot transfer models. Our work pioneers the creation of a robustness benchmark, offering valuable insights and establishing a foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Workshop on Foundation Models Meet Embodied Agents at CVPR 2025 (Non-archival Track)</p></details> |
| **[OV-COAST: Cost Aggregation with Optimal Transport for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03706v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) entails assigning semantic labels to each pixel in an image using textual descriptions, typically leveraging world models such as CLIP. To enhance out-of-domain generalization, we propose Cost Aggregation with Optimal Transport (OV-COAST) for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To align visual-language features within the framework of optimal transport theory, we employ cost volume to construct a cost matrix, which quantifies the distance between two distributions. Our approach adopts a two-stage optimization strategy: in the first stage, the optimal transport problem is solved using cost volume via Sinkhorn distance to obtain an alignment solution; in the second stage, this solution is used to guide the training of the CAT-Seg model. We evaluate state-of-the-art OVSS models on the MESS benchmark, where our approach notably improves the performance of the cost-aggregation model CAT-Seg with ViT-B backbone, achieving superior results, surpassing CAT-Seg by 1.72 % and SAN-B by 4.9 % mIoU.

| **[A Survey on Training-free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22209v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is one of the most fundamental tasks in image understanding with a long history of research, and subsequently a myriad of different approaches. Traditional methods strive to train models up from scratch, requiring vast amounts of computational resources and training data. In the advent of moving to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which asks models to classify beyond learned categories, large quantities of finely annotated data would be prohibitively expensive. Researchers have instead turned to training-free methods where they leverage existing models made for tasks where data is more easily acquired. Specifically, this survey will cover the history, nuance, idea development and the state-of-the-art in training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation that leverages existing multi-modal classification models. We will first give a preliminary on the task definition followed by an overview of popular model archetypes and then spotlight over 30 approaches split into broader research branches: purely CLIP-based, those leveraging auxiliary visual foundation models and ones relying on generative methods. Subsequently, we will discuss the limitations and potential problems of current research, as well as provide some underexplored ideas for future study. We believe this survey will serve as a good onboarding read to new researchers and spark increased interest in the area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21844v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, test-time adaptation has attracted wide interest in the context of vision-language models for image classification. However, to the best of our knowledge, the problem is completely overlooked in dense prediction tasks such as Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS). In response, we propose a novel TTA method tailored to adapting VLMs for segmentation during test time. Unlike TTA methods for image classification, our Multi-Level and Multi-Prompt (MLMP) entropy minimization integrates features from intermediate vision-encoder layers and is performed with different text-prompt templates at both the global CLS token and local pixel-wise levels. Our approach could be used as plug-and-play for any segmentation network, does not require additional training data or labels, and remains effective even with a single test sample. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive OVSS TTA benchmark suite, which integrates a rigorous evaluation protocol, seven segmentation datasets, and 15 common corruptions, with a total of 82 distinct test scenarios, establishing a standardized and comprehensive testbed for future TTA research in open-vocabulary segmentation. Our experiments on this suite demonstrate that our segmentation-tailored method consistently delivers significant gains over direct adoption of TTA classification baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPSeg: Dual-Prompt Cost Volume Learning for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11676v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to segment images into distinct semantic regions for both seen and unseen categories at the pixel level. Current methods utilize text embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP but struggle with the inherent domain gap between image and text embeddings, even after extensive alignment during training. Additionally, relying solely on deep text-aligned features limits shallow-level feature guidance, which is crucial for detecting small objects and fine details, ultimately reducing segmentation accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a dual prompting framework, DPSeg, for this task. Our approach combines dual-prompt cost volume generation, a cost volume-guided decoder, and a semantic-guided prompt refinement strategy that leverages our dual prompting scheme to mitigate alignment issues in visual prompt generation. By incorporating visual embeddings from a visual prompt encoder, our approach reduces the domain gap between text and image embeddings while providing multi-level guidance through shallow features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on multiple public datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[3D Vision-Language Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07577v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models have propelled the development of multi-modal 3D scene understanding, which has vital applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual/augmented reality. However, current multi-modal scene understanding approaches have naively embedded semantic representations into 3D reconstruction methods without striking a balance between visual and language modalities, which leads to unsatisfying semantic rasterization of translucent or reflective objects, as well as over-fitting on color modality. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a solution that adequately handles the distinct visual and semantic modalities, i.e., a 3D vision-language Gaussian splatting model for scene understanding, to put emphasis on the representation learning of language modality. We propose a novel cross-modal rasterizer, using modality fusion along with a smoothed semantic indicator for enhancing semantic rasterization. We also employ a camera-view blending technique to improve semantic consistency between existing and synthesized views, thereby effectively mitigating over-fitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

These foundational models, especially CLIP, have accelerated research in open-vocabulary computer vision tasks, including Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS). Although the initial results are promising, the dense prediction capabilities of VLMs still require further improvement. In this study, we enhance the semantic segmentation performance of CLIP by introducing new modules and modifications: 1) architectural changes in the last layer of ViT and the incorporation of attention maps from the middle layers with the last layer, 2) Image Engineering: applying data augmentations to enrich input image representations, and 3) using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate definitions and synonyms for each class name to leverage CLIP's open-vocabulary capabilities. Our training-free method, ITACLIP, outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on segmentation benchmarks such as COCO-Stuff, COCO-Object, Pascal Context, and Pascal VOC.

| **[econSG: Efficient and Multi-view Consistent Open-Vocabulary 3D Semantic Gaussians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06003v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary focus of most recent works on open-vocabulary neural fields is extracting precise semantic features from the VLMs and then consolidating them efficiently into a multi-view consistent 3D neural fields representation. However, most existing works over-trusted SAM to regularize image-level CLIP without any further refinement. Moreover, several existing works improved efficiency by dimensionality reduction of semantic features from 2D VLMs before fusing with 3DGS semantic fields, which inevitably leads to multi-view inconsistency. In this work, we propose econSG for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with 3DGS. Our econSG consists of: 1) A Confidence-region Guided Regularization (CRR) that mutually refines SAM and CLIP to get the best of both worlds for precise semantic features with complete and precise boundaries. 2) A low dimensional contextual space to enforce 3D multi-view consistency while improving computational efficiency by fusing backprojected multi-view 2D features and follow by dimensional reduction directly on the fused 3D features instead of operating on each 2D view separately. Our econSG shows state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets compared to the existing methods. Furthermore, we are also the most efficient training among all the methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling Spectral Graph for Object-Context Aware Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17150v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) has advanced with recent vision-language models (VLMs), enabling segmentation beyond predefined categories through various learning schemes. Notably, training-free methods offer scalable, easily deployable solutions for handling unseen data, a key goal of OVSS. Yet, a critical issue persists: lack of object-level context consideration when segmenting complex objects in the challenging environment of OVSS based on arbitrary query prompts. This oversight limits models' ability to group semantically consistent elements within object and map them precisely to user-defined arbitrary classes. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that overcomes this limitation by incorporating object-level contextual knowledge within images. Specifically, our model enhances intra-object consistency by distilling spectral-driven features from vision foundation models into the attention mechanism of the visual encoder, enabling semantically coherent components to form a single object mask. Additionally, we refine the text embeddings with zero-shot object presence likelihood to ensure accurate alignment with the specific objects represented in the images. By leveraging object-level contextual knowledge, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalizability across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods address this by sequentially connecting a powerful mask proposal generator, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP. But these two-stage approaches often suffer from high computational costs, memory inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose ESC-Net, a novel one-stage open-vocabulary segmentation model that leverages the SAM decoder blocks for class-agnostic segmentation within an efficient inference framework. By embedding pseudo prompts generated from image-text correlations into SAM's promptable segmentation framework, ESC-Net achieves refined spatial aggregation for accurate mask predictions. ESC-Net achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks, including ADE20K, PASCAL-VOC, and PASCAL-Context, outperforming prior methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate its robustness across challenging conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Autonomous assistive robots, such as smart wheelchairs, require robust capabilities in spatial segmentation and semantic recognition to navigate complex built environments effectively. Place segmentation involves delineating spatial regions like rooms or functional areas, while semantic recognition assigns semantic labels to these regions, enabling accurate localization to user-specific needs. Existing approaches often utilize deep learning; however, these close-vocabulary detection systems struggle to interpret intuitive and casual human instructions. Additionally, most existing methods ignore the uncertainty of the scene recognition problem, leading to low success rates, particularly in ambiguous and complex environments. To address these challenges, we propose an open-vocabulary scene semantic segmentation and detection pipeline leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach follows a 'Segment Detect Select' framework for open-vocabulary scene classification, enabling adaptive and intuitive navigation for assistive robots in built environments.</p></details> | 32 pages, 7 figures |

However, large shifts between training and test domains degrade their performance, requiring fine-tuning for effective real-world applications. We introduce Semantic Library Adaptation (SemLA), a novel framework for training-free, test-time domain adaptation. SemLA leverages a library of LoRA-based adapters indexed with CLIP embeddings, dynamically merging the most relevant adapters based on proximity to the target domain in the embedding space. This approach constructs an ad-hoc model tailored to each specific input without additional training. Our method scales efficiently, enhances explainability by tracking adapter contributions, and inherently protects data privacy, making it ideal for sensitive applications. Comprehensive experiments on a 20-domain benchmark built over 10 standard datasets demonstrate SemLA's superior adaptability and performance across diverse settings, establishing a new standard in domain adaptation for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Rethinking the Global Knowledge of CLIP in Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06818v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works modify CLIP to perform open-vocabulary semantic segmentation in a training-free manner (TF-OVSS). In vanilla CLIP, patch-wise image representations mainly encode homogeneous image-level properties, which hinders the application of CLIP to the dense prediction task. Previous TF-OVSS works sacrifice globality to enhance the locality of CLIP features, by making each patch mainly attend to itself or its neighboring patches within a narrow local window. With their modifications,the ability of CLIP to aggregate global context information is largely weakened. Differently, in this paper, we rethink the global knowledge encoded by CLIP and propose GCLIP to answer how to extract and utilize beneficial global knowledge of CLIP for TF-OVSS. As the representation of each patch is finally determined by the attention weights and the Value embeddings, we propose to reshape the last-block attention and Value embeddings to aggregate useful global context into final features. Firstly, we aim to equip the last-block attention with image-level properties while not introducing homogeneous attention patterns across patches. To realize the goal, we fuse the attention from the global-token emerging blocks with the Query-Query attention. Secondly, we aim to make Value embeddings of the last-block attention module more semantically correlated. To realize this, we design a novel channel suppression strategy.Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Test-Time Optimization for Domain Adaptive Open Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04696v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Seg-TTO, a novel framework for zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS), designed to excel in specialized domain tasks. While current open-vocabulary approaches show impressive performance on standard segmentation benchmarks under zero-shot settings, they fall short of supervised counterparts on highly domain-specific datasets. We focus on segmentation-specific test-time optimization to address this gap. Segmentation requires an understanding of multiple concepts within a single image while retaining the locality and spatial structure of representations. We propose a novel self-supervised objective adhering to these requirements and use it to align the model parameters with input images at test time. In the textual modality, we learn multiple embeddings for each category to capture diverse concepts within an image, while in the visual modality, we calculate pixel-level losses followed by embedding aggregation operations specific to preserving spatial structure. Our resulting framework termed Seg-TTO is a plug-and-play module. We integrate Seg-TTO with three state-of-the-art OVSS approaches and evaluate across 22 challenging OVSS tasks covering a range of specialized domains. Our Seg-TTO demonstrates clear performance improvements (up to 27% mIoU increase on some datasets) establishing new state-of-the-art. Our code and models will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |

While this flexibility represents a significant advancement, current approaches still rely on manually specified class names as input, creating an inherent bottleneck in real-world applications. This work proposes a Vocabulary-Free Semantic Segmentation pipeline, eliminating the need for predefined class vocabularies. Specifically, we address the chicken-and-egg problem where users need knowledge of all potential objects within a scene to identify them, yet the purpose of segmentation is often to discover these objects. The proposed approach leverages Vision-Language Models to automatically recognize objects and generate appropriate class names, aiming to solve the challenge of class specification and naming quality. Through extensive experiments on several public datasets, we highlight the crucial role of the text encoder in model performance, particularly when the image text classes are paired with generated descriptions. Despite the challenges introduced by the sensitivity of the segmentation text encoder to false negatives within the class tagging process, which adds complexity to the task, we demonstrate that our fully automated pipeline significantly enhances vocabulary-free segmentation accuracy across diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to: Pattern Recognition Letters, Klara Reichard and Giulia Rizzoli equally contributed to this work</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Redundancy Reduction for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17642v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is an open-world task that aims to assign each pixel within an image to a specific class defined by arbitrary text descriptions. Recent advancements in large-scale vision-language models have demonstrated their open-vocabulary understanding capabilities, significantly facilitating the development of OVSS. However, most existing methods suffer from either suboptimal performance or long latency. This study introduces ERR-Seg, a novel framework that effectively reduces redundancy to balance accuracy and efficiency. ERR-Seg incorporates a training-free Channel Reduction Module (CRM) that leverages prior knowledge from vision-language models like CLIP to identify the most relevant classes while discarding others. Moreover, it incorporates Efficient Semantic Context Fusion (ESCF) with spatial-level and class-level sequence reduction strategies. CRM and ESCF result in substantial memory and computational savings without compromising accuracy. Additionally, recognizing the significance of hierarchical semantics extracted from middle-layer features for closed-set semantic segmentation, ERR-Seg introduces the Hierarchical Semantic Module (HSM) to exploit hierarchical semantics in the context of OVSS. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods under the ADE20K-847 setting, ERR-Seg achieves +$5.6\%$ mIoU improvement and reduces latency by $67.3\%$.</p></details> |  |
| **[InvSeg: Test-Time Prompt Inversion for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11473v2)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-textual correlations in the attention maps derived from text-to-image diffusion models are proven beneficial to dense visual prediction tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation. However, a significant challenge arises due to the input distributional discrepancy between the context-rich sentences used for image generation and the isolated class names typically used in semantic segmentation. This discrepancy hinders diffusion models from capturing accurate visual-textual correlations. To solve this, we propose InvSeg, a test-time prompt inversion method that tackles open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by inverting image-specific visual context into text prompt embedding space, leveraging structure information derived from the diffusion model's reconstruction process to enrich text prompts so as to associate each class with a structure-consistent mask. Specifically, we introduce Contrastive Soft Clustering (CSC) to align derived masks with the image's structure information, softly selecting anchors for each class and calculating weighted distances to push inner-class pixels closer while separating inter-class pixels, thereby ensuring mask distinction and internal consistency. By incorporating sample-specific context, InvSeg learns context-rich text prompts in embedding space and achieves accurate semantic alignment across modalities. Experiments show that InvSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context and COCO Object datasets.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[FGAseg: Fine-Grained Pixel-Text Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00877v2)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary segmentation aims to identify and segment specific regions and objects based on text-based descriptions. A common solution is to leverage powerful vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to bridge the gap between vision and text information. However, VLMs are typically pretrained for image-level vision-text alignment, focusing on global semantic features. In contrast, segmentation tasks require fine-grained pixel-level alignment and detailed category boundary information, which VLMs alone cannot provide. As a result, information extracted directly from VLMs can't meet the requirements of segmentation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose FGAseg, a model designed for fine-grained pixel-text alignment and category boundary supplementation. The core of FGAseg is a Pixel-Level Alignment module that employs a cross-modal attention mechanism and a text-pixel alignment loss to refine the coarse-grained alignment from CLIP, achieving finer-grained pixel-text semantic alignment. Additionally, to enrich category boundary information, we introduce the alignment matrices as optimizable pseudo-masks during forward propagation and propose Category Information Supplementation module. These pseudo-masks, derived from cosine and convolutional similarity, provide essential global and local boundary information between different categories. By combining these two strategies, FGAseg effectively enhances pixel-level alignment and category boundary information, addressing key challenges in open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FGAseg outperforms existing methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[OVGaussian: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Segmentation with Open Vocabularies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00326v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary scene understanding using 3D Gaussian (3DGS) representations has garnered considerable attention. However, existing methods mostly lift knowledge from large 2D vision models into 3DGS on a scene-by-scene basis, restricting the capabilities of open-vocabulary querying within their training scenes so that lacking the generalizability to novel scenes. In this work, we propose \textbf{OVGaussian}, a generalizable \textbf{O}pen-\textbf{V}ocabulary 3D semantic segmentation framework based on the 3D \textbf{Gaussian} representation. We first construct a large-scale 3D scene dataset based on 3DGS, dubbed \textbf{SegGaussian}, which provides detailed semantic and instance annotations for both Gaussian points and multi-view images. To promote semantic generalization across scenes, we introduce Generalizable Semantic Rasterization (GSR), which leverages a 3D neural network to learn and predict the semantic property for each 3D Gaussian point, where the semantic property can be rendered as multi-view consistent 2D semantic maps. In the next, we propose a Cross-modal Consistency Learning (CCL) framework that utilizes open-vocabulary annotations of 2D images and 3D Gaussians within SegGaussian to train the 3D neural network capable of open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across Gaussian-based 3D scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that OVGaussian significantly outperforms baseline methods, exhibiting robust cross-scene, cross-domain, and novel-view generalization capabilities. Code and the SegGaussian dataset will be released. (https://github.com/runnanchen/OVGaussian).</p></details> |  |

However, unlike vision-language models such as CLIP, self-supervised visual features are not readily aligned with language, hindering their adoption in open-vocabulary tasks. Our method, named dino.txt, unlocks this new ability for DINOv2, a widely used self-supervised visual encoder. We build upon the LiT training strategy, which trains a text encoder to align with a frozen vision model but leads to unsatisfactory results on dense tasks. We propose several key ingredients to improve performance on both global and dense tasks, such as concatenating the [CLS] token with the patch average to train the alignment and curating data using both text and image modalities. With these, we successfully train a CLIP-like model with only a fraction of the computational cost compared to CLIP while achieving state-of-the-art results in zero-shot classification and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Feature Pyramid Tokenization and Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14145v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The visual understanding are often approached from 3 granular levels: image, patch and pixel. Visual Tokenization, trained by self-supervised reconstructive learning, compresses visual data by codebook in patch-level with marginal information loss, but the visual tokens does not have semantic meaning. Open Vocabulary semantic segmentation benefits from the evolving Vision-Language models (VLMs) with strong image zero-shot capability, but transferring image-level to pixel-level understanding remains an imminent challenge. In this paper, we treat segmentation as tokenizing pixels and study a united perceptual and semantic token compression for all granular understanding and consequently facilitate open vocabulary semantic segmentation. Referring to the cognitive process of pretrained VLM where the low-level features are progressively composed to high-level semantics, we propose Feature Pyramid Tokenization (PAT) to cluster and represent multi-resolution feature by learnable codebooks and then decode them by joint learning pixel reconstruction and semantic segmentation. We design loosely coupled pixel and semantic learning branches. The pixel branch simulates bottom-up composition and top-down visualization of codebook tokens, while the semantic branch collectively fuse hierarchical codebooks as auxiliary segmentation guidance. Our experiments show that PAT enhances the semantic intuition of VLM feature pyramid, improves performance over the baseline segmentation model and achieves competitive performance on open vocabulary semantic segmentation benchmark. Our model is parameter-efficient for VLM integration and flexible for the independent tokenization. We hope to give inspiration not only on improving segmentation but also on semantic visual token utilization.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

To address this, researchers have explored two independent approaches: adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and leveraging synthetic data. However, VLMs often struggle with granularity, failing to disentangle fine-grained concepts, while synthetic data-based methods remain limited by the scope of available datasets. This paper proposes enhancing segmentation accuracy across diverse domains by integrating Vision-Language reasoning with key strategies for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). First, we improve the fine-grained segmentation capabilities of VLMs through multi-scale contextual data, robust text embeddings with prompt augmentation, and layer-wise fine-tuning in our proposed Foundational-Retaining Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (FROVSS) framework. Next, we incorporate these enhancements into a UDA framework by employing distillation to stabilize training and cross-domain mixed sampling to boost adaptability without compromising generalization. The resulting UDA-FROVSS framework is the first UDA approach to effectively adapt across domains without requiring shared categories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Vision-Text Representation Optimizing for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00744v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models, e.g. CLIP, have been increasingly used to address the challenging Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) task, benefiting from their well-aligned vision-text embedding space. Typical solutions involve either freezing CLIP during training to unilaterally maintain its zero-shot capability, or fine-tuning CLIP vision encoder to achieve perceptual sensitivity to local regions. However, few of them incorporate vision-text collaborative optimization. Based on this, we propose the Content-Dependent Transfer to adaptively enhance each text embedding by interacting with the input image, which presents a parameter-efficient way to optimize the text representation. Besides, we additionally introduce a Representation Compensation strategy, reviewing the original CLIP-V representation as compensation to maintain the zero-shot capability of CLIP. In this way, the vision and text representation of CLIP are optimized collaboratively, enhancing the alignment of the vision-text feature space. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to establish the collaborative vision-text optimizing mechanism within the OVS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior performance on popular OVS benchmarks. In open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches by +0.5, +2.3, +3.4, +0.4 and +1.1 mIoU, respectively on A-847, A-150, PC-459, PC-59 and PAS-20. Furthermore, in a panoptic setting on ADE20K, we achieve the performance of 27.1 PQ, 73.5 SQ, and 32.9 RQ.

Recent studies have expanded their applications in autonomous reconstruction through task assignment methods. However, these methods are mainly limited to single robot, and rapid reconstruction of large-scale scenes remains challenging. Additionally, task-driven planning based on surface uncertainty is prone to being trapped in local optima. To this end, we propose the first 3DGS-based centralized multi-robot autonomous 3D reconstruction framework. To further reduce time cost of task generation and improve reconstruction quality, we integrate online open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with surface uncertainty of 3DGS, focusing view sampling on regions with high instance uncertainty. Finally, we develop a multi-robot collaboration strategy with mode and task assignments improving reconstruction quality while ensuring planning efficiency. Our method demonstrates the highest reconstruction quality among all planning methods and superior planning efficiency compared to existing multi-robot methods. We deploy our method on multiple robots, and results show that it can effectively plan view paths and reconstruct scenes with high quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMSeg: Unleashing the Power of Large-Scale Models for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00364v1)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is widely agreed that open-vocabulary-based approaches outperform classical closed-set training solutions for recognizing unseen objects in images for semantic segmentation. Existing open-vocabulary approaches leverage vision-language models, such as CLIP, to align visual features with rich semantic features acquired through pre-training on large-scale vision-language datasets. However, the text prompts employed in these methods are short phrases based on fixed templates, failing to capture comprehensive object attributes. Moreover, while the CLIP model excels at exploiting image-level features, it is less effective at pixel-level representation, which is crucial for semantic segmentation tasks. In this work, we propose to alleviate the above-mentioned issues by leveraging multiple large-scale models to enhance the alignment between fine-grained visual features and enriched linguistic features. Specifically, our method employs large language models (LLMs) to generate enriched language prompts with diverse visual attributes for each category, including color, shape/size, and texture/material. Additionally, for enhanced visual feature extraction, the SAM model is adopted as a supplement to the CLIP visual encoder through a proposed learnable weighted fusion strategy. Built upon these techniques, our method, termed LMSeg, achieves state-of-the-art performance across all major open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks. The code will be made available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning in Hyperspherical Space for Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18840v2)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation seeks to label each pixel in an image with arbitrary text descriptions. Vision-language foundation models, especially CLIP, have recently emerged as powerful tools for acquiring open-vocabulary capabilities. However, fine-tuning CLIP to equip it with pixel-level prediction ability often suffers three issues: 1) high computational cost, 2) misalignment between the two inherent modalities of CLIP, and 3) degraded generalization ability on unseen categories. To address these issues, we propose H-CLIP a symmetrical parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy conducted in hyperspherical space for both of the two CLIP modalities. Specifically, the PEFT strategy is achieved by a series of efficient block-diagonal learnable transformation matrices and a dual cross-relation communication module among all learnable matrices. Since the PEFT strategy is conducted symmetrically to the two CLIP modalities, the misalignment between them is mitigated. Furthermore, we apply an additional constraint to PEFT on the CLIP text encoder according to the hyperspherical energy principle, i.e., minimizing hyperspherical energy during fine-tuning preserves the intrinsic structure of the original parameter space, to prevent the destruction of the generalization ability offered by the CLIP text encoder. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks show that H-CLIP achieves new SOTA open-vocabulary semantic segmentation results while only requiring updating approximately 4% of the total parameters of CLIP.</p></details> |  |

The key is to improve spatial representation of image-level CLIP, such as replacing self-attention map at last layer with self-self attention map or vision foundation model based attention map. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical framework, named CLIPer, that hierarchically improves spatial representation of CLIP. The proposed CLIPer includes an early-layer fusion module and a fine-grained compensation module. We observe that, the embeddings and attention maps at early layers can preserve spatial structural information. Inspired by this, we design the early-layer fusion module to generate segmentation map with better spatial coherence. Afterwards, we employ a fine-grained compensation module to compensate the local details using the self-attention maps of diffusion model. We conduct the experiments on seven segmentation datasets. Our proposed CLIPer achieves the state-of-the-art performance on these datasets. For instance, using ViT-L, CLIPer has the mIoU of 69.8% and 43.3% on VOC and COCO Object, outperforming ProxyCLIP by 9.2% and 4.1% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepange and code: https://linsun449.github.io/cliper</p></details> |

Nevertheless, traditional techniques such as global feature alignment or vision-language model distillation tend to impose only approximate correspondence, struggling notably with delineating fine-grained segmentation boundaries. To address this gap, we propose a more meticulous mask-level alignment between 3D features and the 2D-text embedding space through a cross-modal mask reasoning framework, XMask3D. In our approach, we developed a mask generator based on the denoising UNet from a pre-trained diffusion model, leveraging its capability for precise textual control over dense pixel representations and enhancing the open-world adaptability of the generated masks. We further integrate 3D global features as implicit conditions into the pre-trained 2D denoising UNet, enabling the generation of segmentation masks with additional 3D geometry awareness. Subsequently, the generated 2D masks are employed to align mask-level 3D representations with the vision-language feature space, thereby augmenting the open vocabulary capability of 3D geometry embeddings. Finally, we fuse complementary 2D and 3D mask features, resulting in competitive performance across multiple benchmarks for 3D open vocabulary semantic segmentation.

Pixel-level interpretation is a critical aspect of remote sensing image applications; however, a prevalent limitation remains the need for extensive manual annotation. For this, we try to introduce open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) into the remote sensing context. However, due to the sensitivity of remote sensing images to low-resolution features, distorted target shapes and ill-fitting boundaries are exhibited in the prediction mask. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple and general upsampler, SimFeatUp, to restore lost spatial information in deep features in a training-free style. Further, based on the observation of the abnormal response of local patch tokens to [CLS] token in CLIP, we propose to execute a straightforward subtraction operation to alleviate the global bias in patch tokens. Extensive experiments are conducted on 17 remote sensing datasets spanning semantic segmentation, building extraction, road detection, and flood detection tasks. Our method achieves an average of 5.8%, 8.2%, 4.0%, and 15.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods on 4 tasks.

Meanwhile, the recent Open-vocabulary Semantic Scene understanding based on large-scale vision language models is effective in open-set settings because it can learn diverse concepts and categories. However, these prior methods fail to generalize across different camera views due to the lack of cross-view geometric modeling. At present, there are limited studies analyzing cross-view learning. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Unsupervised Cross-view Adaptation Learning approach to modeling the geometric structural change across views in Semantic Scene Understanding. First, we introduce a novel Cross-view Geometric Constraint on Unpaired Data to model structural changes in images and segmentation masks across cameras. Second, we present a new Geodesic Flow-based Correlation Metric to efficiently measure the geometric structural changes across camera views. Third, we introduce a novel view-condition prompting mechanism to enhance the view-information modeling of the open-vocabulary segmentation network in cross-view adaptation learning. The experiments on different cross-view adaptation benchmarks have shown the effectiveness of our approach in cross-view modeling, demonstrating that we achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance compared to prior unsupervised domain adaptation and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS'24</p></details> |

Traditional RGB-T semantic segmentation models often struggle to generalize across diverse scenarios due to their reliance on pretrained models and predefined categories. Recent advancements in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have facilitated a shift from closed-set to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods. However, these models face challenges in dealing with intricate scenes, primarily due to the heterogeneity between RGB and thermal modalities. To address this gap, we present Open-RGBT, a novel open-vocabulary RGB-T semantic segmentation model. Specifically, we obtain instance-level detection proposals by incorporating visual prompts to enhance category understanding. Additionally, we employ the CLIP model to assess image-text similarity, which helps correct semantic consistency and mitigates ambiguities in category identification. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Open-RGBT achieves superior performance in diverse and challenging real-world scenarios, even in the wild, significantly advancing the field of RGB-T semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, unlike previous research that ignores the ``noise'' raised during feature projection from 2D to 3D, we propose a novel distillation learning framework named CUS3D. In our approach, an object-level denosing projection module is designed to screen out the ``noise'' and ensure more accurate 3D feature. Based on the obtained features, a multimodal distillation learning module is designed to align the 3D feature with CLIP semantic feature space with object-centered constrains to achieve advanced unsupervised semantic segmentation. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both unsupervised and open-vocabulary segmentation, and the results consistently showcase the superiority of our model in achieving advanced unsupervised segmentation results and its effectiveness in open-vocabulary segmentation.</p></details> | 6 pages,3 figures |

Meanwhile, vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, have showcased remarkable effectiveness in numerous zero-shot image-level tasks, owing to their robust generalizability. Recently, a body of work has investigated utilizing these models in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However, existing approaches often rely on impractical supervised pre-training or access to additional pre-trained networks. In this work, we propose a strong baseline for training-free OVSS, termed Neighbour-Aware CLIP (NACLIP), representing a straightforward adaptation of CLIP tailored for this scenario. Our method enforces localization of patches in the self-attention of CLIP's vision transformer which, despite being crucial for dense prediction tasks, has been overlooked in the OVSS literature. By incorporating design choices favouring segmentation, our approach significantly improves performance without requiring additional data, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or extensive hyperparameter tuning, making it highly practical for real-world applications.

However, existing approaches utilizing CLIP's text and patch embeddings to generate semantic masks often misidentify input pixels from unseen classes, leading to confusion between novel classes and semantically similar ones. In this work, we propose a novel approach, TagCLIP (Trusty-aware guided CLIP), to address this issue. We disentangle the ill-posed optimization problem into two parallel processes: semantic matching performed individually and reliability judgment for improving discrimination ability. Building on the idea of special tokens in language modeling representing sentence-level embeddings, we introduce a trusty token that enables distinguishing novel classes from known ones in prediction. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012, COCO-Stuff 164K and PASCAL Context. Our results show that TagCLIP improves the Intersection over Union (IoU) of unseen classes by 7.4%, 1.7% and 2.1%, respectively, with negligible overheads.

However, challenges arise due to limited event-based data and the absence of large-scale segmentation benchmarks. Current works are confined to closed-set semantic segmentation, limiting their adaptability to other applications. In this paper, we introduce OVOSE, the first Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation algorithm for Event cameras. OVOSE leverages synthetic event data and knowledge distillation from a pre-trained image-based foundation model to an event-based counterpart, effectively preserving spatial context and transferring open-vocabulary semantic segmentation capabilities. We evaluate the performance of OVOSE on two driving semantic segmentation datasets DDD17, and DSEC-Semantic, comparing it with existing conventional image open-vocabulary models adapted for event-based data. Similarly, we compare OVOSE with state-of-the-art methods designed for closed-set settings in unsupervised domain adaptation for event-based semantic segmentation. OVOSE demonstrates superior performance, showcasing its potential for real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/ram95d/OVOSE.</p></details> | conference |

Plenty of the previous art casts this task as pixel-to-text classification without object-level comprehension, leveraging the image-to-text classification capability of pretrained vision-and-language models. We argue that visual objects are distinguishable without the prior text information as segmentation is essentially a vision task. Lazy visual grounding first discovers object masks covering an image with iterative Normalized cuts and then later assigns text on the discovered objects in a late interaction manner. Our model requires no additional training yet shows great performance on five public datasets: Pascal VOC, Pascal Context, COCO-object, COCO-stuff, and ADE 20K.

While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models shine in recognizing visual concepts from text, they often struggle with segment coherence due to their limited localization ability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) excel at acquiring spatially consistent local visual representations, yet they fall short in semantic understanding. This paper introduces ProxyCLIP, an innovative framework designed to harmonize the strengths of both CLIP and VFMs, facilitating enhanced open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. ProxyCLIP leverages the spatial feature correspondence from VFMs as a form of proxy attention to augment CLIP, thereby inheriting the VFMs' robust local consistency and maintaining CLIP's exceptional zero-shot transfer capacity. We propose an adaptive normalization and masking strategy to get the proxy attention from VFMs, allowing for adaptation across different VFMs. Remarkably, as a training-free approach, ProxyCLIP significantly improves the average mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) across eight benchmarks from 40.3 to 44.4, showcasing its exceptional efficacy in bridging the gap between spatial precision and semantic richness for the open-vocabulary segmentation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

In this work, we propose a model, called SegPoint, that leverages the reasoning capabilities of a multi-modal Large Language Model (LLM) to produce point-wise segmentation masks across a diverse range of tasks: 1) 3D instruction segmentation, 2) 3D referring segmentation, 3) 3D semantic segmentation, and 4) 3D open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To advance 3D instruction research, we introduce a new benchmark, Instruct3D, designed to evaluate segmentation performance from complex and implicit instructional texts, featuring 2,565 point cloud-instruction pairs. Our experimental results demonstrate that SegPoint achieves competitive performance on established benchmarks such as ScanRefer for referring segmentation and ScanNet for semantic segmentation, while delivering outstanding outcomes on the Instruct3D dataset.

In this paper, we carefully re-investigate the architecture of CLIP, and identify residual connections as the primary source of noise that degrades segmentation quality. With a comparative analysis of statistical properties in the residual connection and the attention output across different pretrained models, we discover that CLIP's image-text contrastive training paradigm emphasizes global features at the expense of local discriminability, leading to noisy segmentation results. In response, we propose ClearCLIP, a novel approach that decomposes CLIP's representations to enhance open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. We introduce three simple modifications to the final layer: removing the residual connection, implementing the self-self attention, and discarding the feed-forward network. ClearCLIP consistently generates clearer and more accurate segmentation maps and outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks, affirming the significance of our discoveries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024. code available at https://github.com/mc- lan/ClearCLIP</p></details> |

However, it is not only costly to obtain training-sufficient dense-annotated panoramas but also application-restricted when training models in a close-vocabulary setting. To tackle this problem, in this work, we define a new task termed Open Panoramic Segmentation (OPS), where models are trained with FoV-restricted pinhole images in the source domain in an open-vocabulary setting while evaluated with FoV-open panoramic images in the target domain, enabling the zero-shot open panoramic semantic segmentation ability of models. Moreover, we propose a model named OOOPS with a Deformable Adapter Network (DAN), which significantly improves zero-shot panoramic semantic segmentation performance. To further enhance the distortion-aware modeling ability from the pinhole source domain, we propose a novel data augmentation method called Random Equirectangular Projection (RERP) which is specifically designed to address object deformations in advance. Surpassing other state-of-the-art open-vocabulary semantic segmentation approaches, a remarkable performance boost on three panoramic datasets, WildPASS, Stanford2D3D, and Matterport3D, proves the effectiveness of our proposed OOOPS model with RERP on the OPS task, especially +2.2% on outdoor WildPASS and +2.4% mIoU on indoor Stanford2D3D.

Despite its success, its application to OVSS faces challenges due to its initial image-level alignment training, which affects its performance in tasks requiring detailed local context. Our study delves into the impact of CLIP's [CLS] token on patch feature correlations, revealing a dominance of "global" patches that hinders local feature discrimination. To overcome this, we propose CLIPtrase, a novel training-free semantic segmentation strategy that enhances local feature awareness through recalibrated self-correlation among patches. This approach demonstrates notable improvements in segmentation accuracy and the ability to maintain semantic coherence across objects.Experiments show that we are 22.3% ahead of CLIP on average on 9 segmentation benchmarks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art training-free methods.The code are made publicly available at: https://github.com/leaves162/CLIPtrase.</p></details> | ECCV24 accepted |

However, leveraging the learned association for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet extremely effective, training-free technique, Plug-and-Play Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (PnP-OVSS) for this task. PnP-OVSS leverages a VLM with direct text-to-image cross-attention and an image-text matching loss. To balance between over-segmentation and under-segmentation, we introduce Salience Dropout; by iteratively dropping patches that the model is most attentive to, we are able to better resolve the entire extent of the segmentation mask. PnP-OVSS does not require any neural network training and performs hyperparameter tuning without the need for any segmentation annotations, even for a validation set. PnP-OVSS demonstrates substantial improvements over comparable baselines (+26.2% mIoU on Pascal VOC, +20.5% mIoU on MS COCO, +3.1% mIoU on COCO Stuff and +3.0% mIoU on ADE20K).

| **[Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Image Embedding Balancing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09829v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is a challenging task, which requires the model to output semantic masks of an image beyond a close-set vocabulary. Although many efforts have been made to utilize powerful CLIP models to accomplish this task, they are still easily overfitting to training classes due to the natural gaps in semantic information between training and new classes. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel framework for openvocabulary semantic segmentation called EBSeg, incorporating an Adaptively Balanced Decoder (AdaB Decoder) and a Semantic Structure Consistency loss (SSC Loss). The AdaB Decoder is designed to generate different image embeddings for both training and new classes. Subsequently, these two types of embeddings are adaptively balanced to fully exploit their ability to recognize training classes and generalization ability for new classes. To learn a consistent semantic structure from CLIP, the SSC Loss aligns the inter-classes affinity in the image feature space with that in the text feature space of CLIP, thereby improving the generalization ability of our model. Furthermore, we employ a frozen SAM image encoder to complement the spatial information that CLIP features lack due to the low training image resolution and image-level supervision inherent in CLIP. Extensive experiments conducted across various benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed EBSeg outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code and trained models will be here: https://github.com/slonetime/EBSeg.</p></details> | CVPR2024 |

Previous works have trained over large amounts of image-caption pairs to enforce pixel-level multimodal alignments. However, captions provide global information about the semantics of a given image but lack direct localization of individual concepts. Further, training on large-scale datasets inevitably brings significant computational costs. In this paper, we propose FreeDA, a training-free diffusion-augmented method for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which leverages the ability of diffusion models to visually localize generated concepts and local-global similarities to match class-agnostic regions with semantic classes. Our approach involves an offline stage in which textual-visual reference embeddings are collected, starting from a large set of captions and leveraging visual and semantic contexts. At test time, these are queried to support the visual matching process, which is carried out by jointly considering class-agnostic regions and global semantic similarities. Extensive analyses demonstrate that FreeDA achieves state-of-the-art performance on five datasets, surpassing previous methods by more than 7.0 average points in terms of mIoU and without requiring any training.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024.

We address this limitation by introducing Generalizable Open-Vocabulary Neural Semantic Fields (GOV-NeSF), a novel approach offering a generalizable implicit representation of 3D scenes with open-vocabulary semantics. We aggregate the geometry-aware features using a cost volume, and propose a Multi-view Joint Fusion module to aggregate multi-view features through a cross-view attention mechanism, which effectively predicts view-specific blending weights for both colors and open-vocabulary features. Remarkably, our GOV-NeSF exhibits state-of-the-art performance in both 2D and 3D open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, eliminating the need for ground truth semantic labels or depth priors, and effectively generalize across scenes and datasets without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

| **[Image-to-Image Matching via Foundation Models: A New Perspective for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00262v1)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment images of arbitrary categories specified by class labels or captions. However, most previous best-performing methods, whether pixel grouping methods or region recognition methods, suffer from false matches between image features and category labels. We attribute this to the natural gap between the textual features and visual features. In this work, we rethink how to mitigate false matches from the perspective of image-to-image matching and propose a novel relation-aware intra-modal matching (RIM) framework for OVS based on visual foundation models. RIM achieves robust region classification by firstly constructing diverse image-modal reference features and then matching them with region features based on relation-aware ranking distribution. The proposed RIM enjoys several merits. First, the intra-modal reference features are better aligned, circumventing potential ambiguities that may arise in cross-modal matching. Second, the ranking-based matching process harnesses the structure information implicit in the inter-class relationships, making it more robust than comparing individually. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that RIM outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, obtaining a lead of more than 10% in mIoU on PASCAL VOC benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2024 |

However, its lack of spatial awareness makes it unsuitable for dense computer vision tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation, without an additional fine-tuning step that often uses annotations and can potentially suppress its original open-vocabulary properties. Meanwhile, self-supervised representation methods have demonstrated good localization properties without human-made annotations nor explicit supervision. In this work, we take the best of both worlds and propose an open-vocabulary semantic segmentation method, which does not require any annotations. We propose to locally improve dense MaskCLIP features, which are computed with a simple modification of CLIP's last pooling layer, by integrating localization priors extracted from self-supervised features. By doing so, we greatly improve the performance of MaskCLIP and produce smooth outputs. Moreover, we show that the used self-supervised feature properties can directly be learnt from CLIP features. Our method CLIP-DINOiser needs only a single forward pass of CLIP and two light convolutional layers at inference, no extra supervision nor extra memory and reaches state-of-the-art results on challenging and fine-grained benchmarks such as COCO, Pascal Context, Cityscapes and ADE20k.

Nevertheless, current approaches encounter an alignment granularity gap owing to the absence of dense annotations, wherein they learn coarse image/region-text alignment during training yet perform group/pixel-level predictions at inference. Such discrepancy leads to suboptimal learning efficiency and inferior zero-shot segmentation results. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Grained Cross-modal Alignment (MGCA) framework, which explicitly learns pixel-level alignment along with object- and region-level alignment to bridge the granularity gap without any dense annotations. Specifically, MGCA ingeniously constructs pseudo multi-granular semantic correspondences upon image-text pairs and collaborates with hard sampling strategies to facilitate fine-grained cross-modal contrastive learning. Further, we point out the defects of existing group and pixel prediction units in downstream segmentation and develop an adaptive semantic unit which effectively mitigates their dilemmas including under- and over-segmentation. Training solely on CC3M, our method achieves significant advancements over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

Most existing methods explore utilizing pre-trained vision-language models, in which the key is to adopt the image-level model for pixel-level segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a simple encoder-decoder, named SED, for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which comprises a hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation and a gradual fusion decoder with category early rejection. The hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation employs hierarchical backbone, instead of plain transformer, to predict pixel-level image-text cost map. Compared to plain transformer, hierarchical backbone better captures local spatial information and has linear computational complexity with respect to input size. Our gradual fusion decoder employs a top-down structure to combine cost map and the feature maps of different backbone levels for segmentation. To accelerate inference speed, we introduce a category early rejection scheme in the decoder that rejects many no-existing categories at the early layer of decoder, resulting in at most 4.7 times acceleration without accuracy degradation. Experiments are performed on multiple open-vocabulary semantic segmentation datasets, which demonstrates the efficacy of our SED method. When using ConvNeXt-B, our SED method achieves mIoU score of 31.6\% on ADE20K with 150 categories at 82 millisecond ($ms$) per image on a single A6000. We will release it at \url{https://github.com/xb534/SED.git}.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 |
| **[Generalizable Semantic Vision Query Generation for Zero-shot Panoptic and Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13697v1)** | 2024-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Panoptic Segmentation (ZPS) aims to recognize foreground instances and background stuff without images containing unseen categories in training. Due to the visual data sparsity and the difficulty of generalizing from seen to unseen categories, this task remains challenging. To better generalize to unseen classes, we propose Conditional tOken aligNment and Cycle trAnsiTion (CONCAT), to produce generalizable semantic vision queries. First, a feature extractor is trained by CON to link the vision and semantics for providing target queries. Formally, CON is proposed to align the semantic queries with the CLIP visual CLS token extracted from complete and masked images. To address the lack of unseen categories, a generator is required. However, one of the gaps in synthesizing pseudo vision queries, ie, vision queries for unseen categories, is describing fine-grained visual details through semantic embeddings. Therefore, we approach CAT to train the generator in semantic-vision and vision-semantic manners. In semantic-vision, visual query contrast is proposed to model the high granularity of vision by pulling the pseudo vision queries with the corresponding targets containing segments while pushing those without segments away. To ensure the generated queries retain semantic information, in vision-semantic, the pseudo vision queries are mapped back to semantic and supervised by real semantic embeddings. Experiments on ZPS achieve a 5.2% hPQ increase surpassing SOTA. We also examine inductive ZPS and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation and obtain comparative results while being 2 times faster in testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Generative and Discriminative Models for Unified Visual Perception with Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16459v1)** | 2024-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable prowess of diffusion models in image generation has spurred efforts to extend their application beyond generative tasks. However, a persistent challenge exists in lacking a unified approach to apply diffusion models to visual perception tasks with diverse semantic granularity requirements. Our purpose is to establish a unified visual perception framework, capitalizing on the potential synergies between generative and discriminative models. In this paper, we propose Vermouth, a simple yet effective framework comprising a pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model containing rich generative priors, a unified head (U-head) capable of integrating hierarchical representations, and an adapted expert providing discriminative priors. Comprehensive investigations unveil potential characteristics of Vermouth, such as varying granularity of perception concealed in latent variables at distinct time steps and various U-net stages. We emphasize that there is no necessity for incorporating a heavyweight or intricate decoder to transform diffusion models into potent representation learners. Extensive comparative evaluations against tailored discriminative models showcase the efficacy of our approach on zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR), few-shot classification, and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks. The promising results demonstrate the potential of diffusion models as formidable learners, establishing their significance in furnishing informative and robust visual representations.</p></details> | 18 pages,11 figures |
| **[Exploring Simple Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12217v1)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation models aim to accurately assign a semantic label to each pixel in an image from a set of arbitrary open-vocabulary texts. In order to learn such pixel-level alignment, current approaches typically rely on a combination of (i) image-level VL model (e.g. CLIP), (ii) ground truth masks, and (iii) custom grouping encoders. In this paper, we introduce S-Seg, a novel model that can achieve surprisingly strong performance without depending on any of the above elements. S-Seg leverages pseudo-mask and language to train a MaskFormer, and can be easily trained from publicly available image-text datasets. Contrary to prior works, our model directly trains for pixel-level features and language alignment. Once trained, S-Seg generalizes well to multiple testing datasets without requiring fine-tuning. In addition, S-Seg has the extra benefits of scalability with data and consistently improvement when augmented with self-training. We believe that our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/zlai0/S-Seg</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Model is Secretly a Training-free Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmenter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02773v3)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-trained text-image discriminative models, such as CLIP, has been explored for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with unsatisfactory results due to the loss of crucial localization information and awareness of object shapes. Recently, there has been a growing interest in expanding the application of generative models from generation tasks to semantic segmentation. These approaches utilize generative models either for generating annotated data or extracting features to facilitate semantic segmentation. This typically involves generating a considerable amount of synthetic data or requiring additional mask annotations. To this end, we uncover the potential of generative text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) as highly efficient open-vocabulary semantic segmenters, and introduce a novel training-free approach named DiffSegmenter. The insight is that to generate realistic objects that are semantically faithful to the input text, both the complete object shapes and the corresponding semantics are implicitly learned by diffusion models. We discover that the object shapes are characterized by the self-attention maps while the semantics are indicated through the cross-attention maps produced by the denoising U-Net, forming the basis of our segmentation results.Additionally, we carefully design effective textual prompts and a category filtering mechanism to further enhance the segmentation results. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed DiffSegmenter achieves impressive results for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Such methods are able to segment scenes into arbitrary classes based on text descriptions provided during runtime. In this paper, we propose to the best of our knowledge the first algorithm for open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation in 3D scenes. Our algorithm, Panoptic Vision-Language Feature Fields (PVLFF), learns a semantic feature field of the scene by distilling vision-language features from a pretrained 2D model, and jointly fits an instance feature field through contrastive learning using 2D instance segments on input frames. Despite not being trained on the target classes, our method achieves panoptic segmentation performance similar to the state-of-the-art closed-set 3D systems on the HyperSim, ScanNet and Replica dataset and additionally outperforms current 3D open-vocabulary systems in terms of semantic segmentation. We ablate the components of our method to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model architecture.

| **[AttrSeg: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation via Attribute Decomposition-Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00096v2)** | 2024-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is a challenging task that requires segmenting novel object categories at inference time. Recent studies have explored vision-language pre-training to handle this task, but suffer from unrealistic assumptions in practical scenarios, i.e., low-quality textual category names. For example, this paradigm assumes that new textual categories will be accurately and completely provided, and exist in lexicons during pre-training. However, exceptions often happen when encountering ambiguity for brief or incomplete names, new words that are not present in the pre-trained lexicons, and difficult-to-describe categories for users. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel attribute decomposition-aggregation framework, AttrSeg, inspired by human cognition in understanding new concepts. Specifically, in the decomposition stage, we decouple class names into diverse attribute descriptions to complement semantic contexts from multiple perspectives. Two attribute construction strategies are designed: using large language models for common categories, and involving manually labeling for human-invented categories. In the aggregation stage, we group diverse attributes into an integrated global description, to form a discriminative classifier that distinguishes the target object from others. One hierarchical aggregation architecture is further proposed to achieve multi-level aggregations, leveraging the meticulously designed clustering module. The final results are obtained by computing the similarity between aggregated attributes and images embeddings. To evaluate the effectiveness, we annotate three types of datasets with attribute descriptions, and conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies. The results show the superior performance of attribute decomposition-aggregation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |

The zero-shot classification capabilities of the model are impressive but are harder to use for dense tasks such as image segmentation. Several methods have proposed different modifications and learning schemes to produce dense output. Instead, we propose in this work an open-vocabulary semantic segmentation method, dubbed CLIP-DIY, which does not require any additional training or annotations, but instead leverages existing unsupervised object localization approaches. In particular, CLIP-DIY is a multi-scale approach that directly exploits CLIP classification abilities on patches of different sizes and aggregates the decision in a single map. We further guide the segmentation using foreground/background scores obtained using unsupervised object localization methods. With our method, we obtain state-of-the-art zero-shot semantic segmentation results on PASCAL VOC and perform on par with the best methods on COCO.

| **[Convolutions Die Hard: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation with Single Frozen Convolutional CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02487v2)** | 2023-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary segmentation is a challenging task requiring segmenting and recognizing objects from an open set of categories. One way to address this challenge is to leverage multi-modal models, such as CLIP, to provide image and text features in a shared embedding space, which bridges the gap between closed-vocabulary and open-vocabulary recognition. Hence, existing methods often adopt a two-stage framework to tackle the problem, where the inputs first go through a mask generator and then through the CLIP model along with the predicted masks. This process involves extracting features from images multiple times, which can be ineffective and inefficient. By contrast, we propose to build everything into a single-stage framework using a shared Frozen Convolutional CLIP backbone, which not only significantly simplifies the current two-stage pipeline, but also remarkably yields a better accuracy-cost trade-off. The proposed FC-CLIP, benefits from the following observations: the frozen CLIP backbone maintains the ability of open-vocabulary classification and can also serve as a strong mask generator, and the convolutional CLIP generalizes well to a larger input resolution than the one used during contrastive image-text pretraining. When training on COCO panoptic data only and testing in a zero-shot manner, FC-CLIP achieve 26.8 PQ, 16.8 AP, and 34.1 mIoU on ADE20K, 18.2 PQ, 27.9 mIoU on Mapillary Vistas, 44.0 PQ, 26.8 AP, 56.2 mIoU on Cityscapes, outperforming the prior art by +4.2 PQ, +2.4 AP, +4.2 mIoU on ADE20K, +4.0 PQ on Mapillary Vistas and +20.1 PQ on Cityscapes, respectively. Additionally, the training and testing time of FC-CLIP is 7.5x and 6.6x significantly faster than the same prior art, while using 5.9x fewer parameters. FC-CLIP also sets a new state-of-the-art performance across various open-vocabulary semantic segmentation datasets.

| **[Uncovering Prototypical Knowledge for Weakly Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19001v1)** | 2023-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the problem of weakly open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (WOVSS), which learns to segment objects of arbitrary classes using mere image-text pairs. Existing works turn to enhance the vanilla vision transformer by introducing explicit grouping recognition, i.e., employing several group tokens/centroids to cluster the image tokens and perform the group-text alignment. Nevertheless, these methods suffer from a granularity inconsistency regarding the usage of group tokens, which are aligned in the all-to-one v.s. one-to-one manners during the training and inference phases, respectively. We argue that this discrepancy arises from the lack of elaborate supervision for each group token. To bridge this granularity gap, this paper explores explicit supervision for the group tokens from the prototypical knowledge. To this end, this paper proposes the non-learnable prototypical regularization (NPR) where non-learnable prototypes are estimated from source features to serve as supervision and enable contrastive matching of the group tokens. This regularization encourages the group tokens to segment objects with less redundancy and capture more comprehensive semantic regions, leading to increased compactness and richness. Based on NPR, we propose the prototypical guidance segmentation network (PGSeg) that incorporates multi-modal regularization by leveraging prototypical sources from both images and texts at different levels, progressively enhancing the segmentation capability with diverse prototypical patterns. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

While significant progress has been made in object-level Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS), i.e., segmenting objects with arbitrary text, the corresponding part-level research poses additional challenges. Firstly, part segmentation inherently involves intricate boundaries, while limited annotated data compounds the challenge. Secondly, part segmentation introduces an open granularity challenge due to the diverse and often ambiguous definitions of parts in the open world. Furthermore, the large-scale vision and language models, which play a key role in the open vocabulary setting, struggle to recognize parts as effectively as objects. To comprehensively investigate and tackle these challenges, we propose an Open-Vocabulary Part Segmentation (OV-PARTS) benchmark. OV-PARTS includes refined versions of two publicly available datasets: Pascal-Part-116 and ADE20K-Part-234. And it covers three specific tasks: Generalized Zero-Shot Part Segmentation, Cross-Dataset Part Segmentation, and Few-Shot Part Segmentation, providing insights into analogical reasoning, open granularity and few-shot adapting abilities of models. Moreover, we analyze and adapt two prevailing paradigms of existing object-level OVSS methods for OV-PARTS. Extensive experimental analysis is conducted to inspire future research in leveraging foundational models for OV-PARTS.

| **[Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Decoupled One-Pass Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01198v2)** | 2023-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the open-vocabulary semantic segmentation problem has attracted increasing attention and the best performing methods are based on two-stream networks: one stream for proposal mask generation and the other for segment classification using a pretrained visual-language model. However, existing two-stream methods require passing a great number of (up to a hundred) image crops into the visual-language model, which is highly inefficient. To address the problem, we propose a network that only needs a single pass through the visual-language model for each input image. Specifically, we first propose a novel network adaptation approach, termed patch severance, to restrict the harmful interference between the patch embeddings in the pre-trained visual encoder. We then propose classification anchor learning to encourage the network to spatially focus on more discriminative features for classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods while being 4 to 7 times faster at inference.

| **[Global Knowledge Calibration for Fast Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09181v2)** | 2023-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, have enabled the segmentation of arbitrary concepts solely from textual inputs, a process commonly referred to as open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS). However, existing OVS techniques confront a fundamental challenge: the trained classifier tends to overfit on the base classes observed during training, resulting in suboptimal generalization performance to unseen classes. To mitigate this issue, recent studies have proposed the use of an additional frozen pre-trained CLIP for classification. Nonetheless, this approach incurs heavy computational overheads as the CLIP vision encoder must be repeatedly forward-passed for each mask, rendering it impractical for real-world applications. To address this challenge, our objective is to develop a fast OVS model that can perform comparably or better without the extra computational burden of the CLIP image encoder during inference. To this end, we propose a core idea of preserving the generalizable representation when fine-tuning on known classes. Specifically, we introduce a text diversification strategy that generates a set of synonyms for each training category, which prevents the learned representation from collapsing onto specific known category names. Additionally, we employ a text-guided knowledge distillation method to preserve the generalizable knowledge of CLIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves robust generalization performance across various datasets. Furthermore, we perform a preliminary exploration of open-vocabulary video segmentation and present a benchmark that can facilitate future open-vocabulary research in the video domain.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2023 |

The pre-trained model can capture enriched visual concepts for images by learning from a large scale of text-image data. However, transferring the learned visual knowledge to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a CLIP-based model named SegCLIP for the topic of open-vocabulary segmentation in an annotation-free manner. The SegCLIP achieves segmentation based on ViT and the main idea is to gather patches with learnable centers to semantic regions through training on text-image pairs. The gathering operation can dynamically capture the semantic groups, which can be used to generate the final segmentation results. We further propose a reconstruction loss on masked patches and a superpixel-based KL loss with pseudo-labels to enhance the visual representation. Experimental results show that our model achieves comparable or superior segmentation accuracy on the PASCAL VOC 2012 (+0.3% mIoU), PASCAL Context (+2.3% mIoU), and COCO (+2.2% mIoU) compared with baselines. We release the code at https://github.com/ArrowLuo/SegCLIP.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often rely on expensive human annotations as supervision for model training, limiting their scalability to large, unlabeled datasets. To address this challenge, we present ZeroSeg, a novel method that leverages the existing pretrained vision-language (VL) model (e.g. CLIP) to train open-vocabulary zero-shot semantic segmentation models. Although acquired extensive knowledge of visual concepts, it is non-trivial to exploit knowledge from these VL models to the task of semantic segmentation, as they are usually trained at an image level. ZeroSeg overcomes this by distilling the visual concepts learned by VL models into a set of segment tokens, each summarizing a localized region of the target image. We evaluate ZeroSeg on multiple popular segmentation benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO, in a zero-shot manner (i.e., no training or adaption on target segmentation datasets). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared to other zero-shot segmentation methods under the same training data, while also performing competitively compared to strongly supervised methods. Finally, we also demonstrated the effectiveness of ZeroSeg on open-vocabulary segmentation, through both human studies and qualitative visualizations.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the natural ability of humans to identify objects through the visualization of depth maps, SAD utilizes SAM to segment the rendered depth map, thus providing cues with enhanced geometry information and mitigating the issue of over-segmentation.

In this work, we first demonstrate the necessity of image-pixel CLIP feature adaption, then provide Multi-View Prompt learning (MVP-SEG) as an effective solution to achieve image-pixel adaptation and to solve open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Concretely, MVP-SEG deliberately learns multiple prompts trained by our Orthogonal Constraint Loss (OCLoss), by which each prompt is supervised to exploit CLIP feature on different object parts, and collaborative segmentation masks generated by all prompts promote better segmentation. Moreover, MVP-SEG introduces Global Prompt Refining (GPR) to further eliminate class-wise segmentation noise. Experiments show that the multi-view prompts learned from seen categories have strong generalization to unseen categories, and MVP-SEG+ which combines the knowledge transfer stage significantly outperforms previous methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, qualitative results justify that MVP-SEG does lead to better focus on different local parts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Mask-adapted CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04150v3)** | 2023-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to segment an image into semantic regions according to text descriptions, which may not have been seen during training. Recent two-stage methods first generate class-agnostic mask proposals and then leverage pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, to classify masked regions. We identify the performance bottleneck of this paradigm to be the pre-trained CLIP model, since it does not perform well on masked images. To address this, we propose to finetune CLIP on a collection of masked image regions and their corresponding text descriptions. We collect training data by mining an existing image-caption dataset (e.g., COCO Captions), using CLIP to match masked image regions to nouns in the image captions. Compared with the more precise and manually annotated segmentation labels with fixed classes (e.g., COCO-Stuff), we find our noisy but diverse dataset can better retain CLIP's generalization ability. Along with finetuning the entire model, we utilize the "blank" areas in masked images using a method we dub mask prompt tuning. Experiments demonstrate mask prompt tuning brings significant improvement without modifying any weights of CLIP, and it can further improve a fully finetuned model. In particular, when trained on COCO and evaluated on ADE20K-150, our best model achieves 29.6% mIoU, which is +8.5% higher than the previous state-of-the-art. For the first time, open-vocabulary generalist models match the performance of supervised specialist models in 2017 without dataset-specific adaptations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2023.

| **[Side Adapter Network for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12242v2)** | 2023-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a new framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with the pre-trained vision-language model, named Side Adapter Network (SAN). Our approach models the semantic segmentation task as a region recognition problem. A side network is attached to a frozen CLIP model with two branches: one for predicting mask proposals, and the other for predicting attention bias which is applied in the CLIP model to recognize the class of masks. This decoupled design has the benefit CLIP in recognizing the class of mask proposals. Since the attached side network can reuse CLIP features, it can be very light. In addition, the entire network can be trained end-to-end, allowing the side network to be adapted to the frozen CLIP model, which makes the predicted mask proposals CLIP-aware. Our approach is fast, accurate, and only adds a few additional trainable parameters. We evaluate our approach on multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our method significantly outperforms other counterparts, with up to 18 times fewer trainable parameters and 19 times faster inference speed. We hope our approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

| **[Learning Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation Models From Natural Language Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09121v2)** | 2023-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider the problem of open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS), which aims to segment objects of arbitrary classes instead of pre-defined, closed-set categories. The main contributions are as follows: First, we propose a transformer-based model for OVS, termed as OVSegmentor, which only exploits web-crawled image-text pairs for pre-training without using any mask annotations. OVSegmentor assembles the image pixels into a set of learnable group tokens via a slot-attention based binding module, and aligns the group tokens to the corresponding caption embedding. Second, we propose two proxy tasks for training, namely masked entity completion and cross-image mask consistency. The former aims to infer all masked entities in the caption given the group tokens, that enables the model to learn fine-grained alignment between visual groups and text entities. The latter enforces consistent mask predictions between images that contain shared entities, which encourages the model to learn visual invariance. Third, we construct CC4M dataset for pre-training by filtering CC12M with frequently appeared entities, which significantly improves training efficiency. Fourth, we perform zero-shot transfer on three benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object. Our model achieves superior segmentation results over the state-of-the-art method by using only 3\% data (4M vs 134M) for pre-training. Code and pre-trained models will be released for future research.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2023 |
| **[A Language-Guided Benchmark for Weakly Supervised Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14163v1)** | 2023-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasing attention is being diverted to data-efficient problem settings like Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) which deals with segmenting an arbitrary object that may or may not be seen during training. The closest standard problems related to OVSS are Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Segmentation (ZSS, FSS) and their Cross-dataset variants where zero to few annotations are needed to segment novel classes. The existing FSS and ZSS methods utilize fully supervised pixel-labelled seen classes to segment unseen classes. Pixel-level labels are hard to obtain, and using weak supervision in the form of inexpensive image-level labels is often more practical. To this end, we propose a novel unified weakly supervised OVSS pipeline that can perform ZSS, FSS and Cross-dataset segmentation on novel classes without using pixel-level labels for either the base (seen) or the novel (unseen) classes in an inductive setting. We propose Weakly-Supervised Language-Guided Segmentation Network (WLSegNet), a novel language-guided segmentation pipeline that i) learns generalizable context vectors with batch aggregates (mean) to map class prompts to image features using frozen CLIP (a vision-language model) and ii) decouples weak ZSS/FSS into weak semantic segmentation and Zero-Shot segmentation. The learned context vectors avoid overfitting on seen classes during training and transfer better to novel classes during testing. WLSegNet avoids fine-tuning and the use of external datasets during training. The proposed pipeline beats existing methods for weak generalized Zero-Shot and weak Few-Shot semantic segmentation by 39 and 3 mIOU points respectively on PASCAL VOC and weak Few-Shot semantic segmentation by 5 mIOU points on MS COCO. On a harder setting of 2-way 1-shot weak FSS, WLSegNet beats the baselines by 13 and 22 mIOU points on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class Enhancement Losses with Pseudo Labels for Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07336v1)** | 2023-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent mask proposal models have significantly improved the performance of zero-shot semantic segmentation. However, the use of a `background' embedding during training in these methods is problematic as the resulting model tends to over-learn and assign all unseen classes as the background class instead of their correct labels. Furthermore, they ignore the semantic relationship of text embeddings, which arguably can be highly informative for zero-shot prediction as seen classes may have close relationship with unseen classes. To this end, this paper proposes novel class enhancement losses to bypass the use of the background embbedding during training, and simultaneously exploit the semantic relationship between text embeddings and mask proposals by ranking the similarity scores. To further capture the relationship between seen and unseen classes, we propose an effective pseudo label generation pipeline using pretrained vision-language model. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our method achieves overall the best performance for zero-shot semantic segmentation.

However, it is still unclear how to make the open-vocabulary recognition work well on broader vision problems. This paper targets open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by building it on an off-the-shelf pre-trained vision-language model, i.e., CLIP. However, semantic segmentation and the CLIP model perform on different visual granularity, that semantic segmentation processes on pixels while CLIP performs on images. To remedy the discrepancy in processing granularity, we refuse the use of the prevalent one-stage FCN based framework, and advocate a two-stage semantic segmentation framework, with the first stage extracting generalizable mask proposals and the second stage leveraging an image based CLIP model to perform open-vocabulary classification on the masked image crops which are generated in the first stage. Our experimental results show that this two-stage framework can achieve superior performance than FCN when trained only on COCO Stuff dataset and evaluated on other datasets without fine-tuning. Moreover, this simple framework also surpasses previous state-of-the-arts of zero-shot semantic segmentation by a large margin: +29.5 hIoU on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset, and +8.9 hIoU on the COCO Stuff dataset. With its simplicity and strong performance, we hope this framework to serve as a baseline to facilitate future research.

| **[Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Patch Aligned Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04994v1)** | 2022-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Patch Aligned Contrastive Learning (PACL), a modified compatibility function for CLIP's contrastive loss, intending to train an alignment between the patch tokens of the vision encoder and the CLS token of the text encoder. With such an alignment, a model can identify regions of an image corresponding to a given text input, and therefore transfer seamlessly to the task of open vocabulary semantic segmentation without requiring any segmentation annotations during training. Using pre-trained CLIP encoders with PACL, we are able to set the state-of-the-art on the task of open vocabulary zero-shot segmentation on 4 different segmentation benchmarks: Pascal VOC, Pascal Context, COCO Stuff and ADE20K. Furthermore, we show that PACL is also applicable to image-level predictions and when used with a CLIP backbone, provides a general improvement in zero-shot classification accuracy compared to CLIP, across a suite of 12 image classification datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate simple, yet effective approaches for adapting the pre-trained foundation models to the downstream task of interest, namely, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) we introduce Fusioner, with a lightweight, transformer-based fusion module, that pairs the frozen visual representation with language concept through a handful of image segmentation data. As a consequence, the model gains the capability of zero-shot transfer to segment novel categories; (ii) without loss of generality, we experiment on a broad range of self-supervised models that have been pre-trained with different schemes, e.g. visual-only models (MoCo v3, DINO), language-only models (BERT), visual-language model (CLIP), and show that, the proposed fusion approach is effective to any pair of visual and language models, even those pre-trained on a corpus of uni-modal data; (iii) we conduct thorough ablation studies to analyze the critical components in our proposed Fusioner, while evaluating on standard benchmarks, e.g. PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i , it surpasses existing state-of-the-art models by a large margin, despite only being trained on frozen visual and language features; (iv) to measure the model's robustness on learning visual-language correspondence, we further evaluate on synthetic dataset, named Mosaic-4, where images are constructed by mosaicking the samples from FSS-1000. Fusioner demonstrates superior performance over previous models.</p></details> | BMVC 2022 Oral |

A critical challenge arises from the domain gap between natural images and medical volumes: existing FMs, pre-trained on 2D data, struggle to capture 3D anatomical context, limiting their utility in clinical applications like tumor segmentation. To address this, we propose an adaptation framework called TAGS: Tumor Adaptive Guidance for SAM, which unlocks 2D FMs for 3D medical tasks through multi-prompt fusion. By preserving most of the pre-trained weights, our approach enhances SAM's spatial feature extraction using CLIP's semantic insights and anatomy-specific prompts. Extensive experiments on three open-source tumor segmentation datasets prove that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models (+46.88% over nnUNet), interactive segmentation frameworks, and other established medical FMs, including SAM-Med2D, SAM-Med3D, SegVol, Universal, 3D-Adapter, and SAM-B (at least +13% over them). This highlights the robustness and adaptability of our proposed framework across diverse medical segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV-APAH</p></details> |

Leveraging such unprecedented data diversity, they exhibit strong open-world segmentation capabilities, with SAM~2 further enhancing these capabilities to support high-quality video segmentation. While SAMs (SAM and SAM~2) have demonstrated excellent performance in segmenting context-independent concepts like people, cars, and roads, they overlook more challenging context-dependent (CD) concepts, such as visual saliency, camouflage, industrial defects, and medical lesions. CD concepts rely heavily on global and local contextual information, making them susceptible to shifts in different contexts, which requires strong discriminative capabilities from the model. The lack of comprehensive evaluation of SAMs limits understanding of their performance boundaries, which may hinder the design of future models. In this paper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of SAMs on 11 CD concepts across 2D and 3D images and videos in various visual modalities within natural, medical, and industrial scenes. We develop a unified evaluation framework for SAM and SAM~2 that supports manual, automatic, and intermediate self-prompting, aided by our specific prompt generation and interaction strategies. We further explore the potential of SAM~2 for in-context learning and introduce prompt robustness testing to simulate real-world imperfect prompts. Finally, we analyze the benefits and limitations of SAMs in understanding CD concepts and discuss their future development in segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission to International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)</p></details> |

To overcome these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image), (ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\% vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability, and interpretability, E-BayesSAM bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs, advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications.

This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods: prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, accepted by Journal of Medical Imaging</p></details> |

Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pre-trained on millions of natural images, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot segmentation performance, providing a potential solution. However, SAM struggles with geographical images, such as aerial and satellite imagery, due to its training being confined to natural images and the narrow features and textures of these objects blending into their surroundings. To address these challenges, we propose Geographical SAM (GeoSAM), a SAM-based framework that fine-tunes SAM using automatically generated multi-modal prompts. Specifically, GeoSAM integrates point prompts from a pre-trained task-specific model as primary visual guidance, and text prompts generated by a large language model as secondary semantic guidance, enabling the model to better capture both spatial structure and contextual meaning. GeoSAM outperforms existing approaches for mobility infrastructure segmentation in both familiar and completely unseen regions by at least 5\% in mIoU, representing a significant leap in leveraging foundation models to segment mobility infrastructure, including both road and pedestrian infrastructure in geographical images.

| **[Adapting SAM via Cross-Entropy Masking for Class Imbalance in Remote Sensing Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10568v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational models have achieved significant success in diverse domains of computer vision. They learn general representations that are easily transferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is Segment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images. We propose adapting the SAM encoder via fine-tuning for remote sensing change detection (RSCD) along with spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) and multi-scale decoder fusion (MSDF) to detect changes robustly at multiple scales. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss to handle high class imbalance in change detection datasets. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four change detection datasets, Levir-CD, WHU-CD, CLCD, and S2Looking. We achieved 2.5% F1-score improvement on a large complex S2Looking dataset. The code is available at: https://github.com/humza909/SAM-CEM-CD</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Think as Cardiac Sonographers: Marrying SAM with Left Ventricular Indicators Measurements According to Clinical Guidelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08566v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However, VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously. Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers, achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective, optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and indicator measurements.

The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown great effectiveness across various video segmentation tasks. However, its application to offline RVOS is challenged by the translation of the text into effective prompts and a lack of global context awareness. In this paper, we propose a novel RVOS framework, termed MPG-SAM 2, to address these challenges. Specifically, MPG-SAM 2 employs a unified multimodal encoder to jointly encode video and textual features, generating semantically aligned video and text embeddings, along with multimodal class tokens. A mask prior generator utilizes the video embeddings and class tokens to create pseudo masks of target objects and global context. These masks are fed into the prompt encoder as dense prompts along with multimodal class tokens as sparse prompts to generate accurate prompts for SAM 2. To provide the online SAM 2 with a global view, we introduce a hierarchical global-historical aggregator, which allows SAM 2 to aggregate global and historical information of target objects at both pixel and object levels, enhancing the target representation and temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on several RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MPG-SAM 2 and the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

| **[SAM Encoder Breach by Adversarial Simplicial Complex Triggers Downstream Model Failures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06127v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications. Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative. Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex. Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,recived by ICCV2025</p></details> |
| **[SGDFuse: SAM-Guided Diffusion for High-Fidelity Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05264v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks. However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at https://github.com/boshizhang123/SGDFuse.</p></details> | Submitted to TCSVT |
| **[Segment Any Vehicle: Semantic and Visual Context Driven SAM and A Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04260v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception, particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge. Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. % Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released upon acceptance. Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/SAV</p></details> |  |

Substantial brain lesions in brain imaging exhibit high heterogeneity, with indistinct boundaries between lesion regions and normal brain tissue. Small lesions in single slices are difficult to identify, making the accurate and reproducible segmentation of abnormal regions, as well as their feature description, highly complex. Existing methods have the following limitations: 1) They rely solely on single-modal information for learning, neglecting the multi-modal information commonly used in diagnosis. This hampers the ability to comprehensively acquire brain lesion information from multiple perspectives and prevents the effective integration and utilization of multi-modal data inputs, thereby limiting a holistic understanding of lesions. 2) They are constrained by the amount of data available, leading to low sensitivity to small lesions and difficulty in detecting subtle pathological changes. 3) Current SAM-based models rely on external prompts, which cannot achieve automatic segmentation and, to some extent, affect diagnostic efficiency.To address these issues, we have developed a large-scale fully automated segmentation model specifically designed for brain lesion segmentation, named BrainSegDMLF. This model has the following features: 1) Dynamic Modal Interactive Fusion (DMIF) module that processes and integrates multi-modal data during the encoding process, providing the SAM encoder with more comprehensive modal information. 2) Layer-by-Layer Upsampling Decoder, enabling the model to extract rich low-level and high-level features even with limited data, thereby detecting the presence of small lesions. 3) Automatic segmentation masks, allowing the model to generate lesion masks automatically without requiring manual prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProSAM: Enhancing the Robustness of SAM-based Visual Reference Segmentation with Probabilistic Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21835v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes, texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts at boundaries of target regions due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we present SAM(a Stability-Aware Manager), an autonomic cache manager that establishes decision stability as a first-class design principle. It achieves this through its core control policy, AURA(Autonomic Utility-balancing Resource Allocator), which resolves the classic exploitation-exploration dilemma by synthesizing two orthogonal factors: the H-factor, representing proven historical efficiency (exploitation), and the V-factor, for estimated marginal gain (exploration). Through this practical synthesis and adaptive control, SAM achieves sustained high performance with strategic stability and robustness in volatile conditions. Extensive experiments against 14 diverse baselines demonstrate SAM's superiority. It achieves top-tier throughput while being uniquely resilient to complex workload shifts and adversarial workloads like cache pollution. Furthermore, its decision latency is highly scalable, remaining nearly constant as the system grows to 120 databases. Crucially, SAM achieves superior decision stability -- maintaining consistent optimization directions despite noise, avoiding performance oscillations while ensuring predictable Quality of Service. These results prove that a principled, stability-aware design is essential for sustained high performance in real-world, large-scale systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures.

However, existing SSCOD methods based on Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically, ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training. Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient SSCOD.

However, the speckle noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight, text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas, TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation, TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS segmentation.

| **[SAM2Long: Enhancing SAM 2 for Long Video Segmentation with a Training-Free Memory Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16268v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has emerged as a powerful foundation model for object segmentation in both images and videos, paving the way for various downstream video applications. The crucial design of SAM 2 for video segmentation is its memory module, which prompts object-aware memories from previous frames for current frame prediction. However, its greedy-selection memory design suffers from the "error accumulation" problem, where an errored or missed mask will cascade and influence the segmentation of the subsequent frames, which limits the performance of SAM 2 toward complex long-term videos. To this end, we introduce SAM2Long, an improved training-free video object segmentation strategy, which considers the segmentation uncertainty within each frame and chooses the video-level optimal results from multiple segmentation pathways in a constrained tree search manner. In practice, we maintain a fixed number of segmentation pathways throughout the video. For each frame, multiple masks are proposed based on the existing pathways, creating various candidate branches. We then select the same fixed number of branches with higher cumulative scores as the new pathways for the next frame. After processing the final frame, the pathway with the highest cumulative score is chosen as the final segmentation result. Benefiting from its heuristic search design, SAM2Long is robust toward occlusions and object reappearances, and can effectively segment and track objects for complex long-term videos. Notably, SAM2Long achieves an average improvement of 3.0 points across all 24 head-to-head comparisons, with gains of up to 5.3 points in J&F on long-term video object segmentation benchmarks such as SA-V and LVOS.

| **[Fully Automated SAM for Single-source Domain Generalization in Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17281v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although SAM-based single-source domain generalization models for medical image segmentation can mitigate the impact of domain shift on the model in cross-domain scenarios, these models still face two major challenges. First, the segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated prompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image segmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second, providing poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large) to the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask results. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain generalization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully automated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted Generation Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty Modeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module integrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty distribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding box prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with SAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image embeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the target object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts. Extensive experiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate the effectiveness of FA-SAM and highlight its potential to address the above challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for presentation at the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (IEEE SMC 2025) and is copyrighted by IEEE</p></details> |

Recent foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization capability in general segmentation tasks, making it a promising solution for few-shot scenarios. However, adapting SAM to CD-FSS faces two critical challenges: reliance on manual prompt and limited cross-domain ability. Therefore, we propose the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework that introduces three key modules: (i) the Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for semantic expansion, (ii) the Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) module for automated meta-prompt synthesis, and (iii) the Frequency-Aware Interaction (FAI) module for domain discrepancy mitigation. Evaluations across four cross-domain datasets demonstrate CMP's state-of-the-art performance, achieving 71.8\% and 74.5\% mIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios respectively.</p></details> | 3 figures |
| **[One Polyp Identifies All: One-Shot Polyp Segmentation with SAM via Cascaded Priors and Iterative Prompt Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16337v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polyp segmentation is vital for early colorectal cancer detection, yet traditional fully supervised methods struggle with morphological variability and domain shifts, requiring frequent retraining. Additionally, reliance on large-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and error-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong generalizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts, effectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since manually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and time-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework based on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated image, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional annotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation (CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to adapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead of dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for iterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality. Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness. Notably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 11.44%.</p></details> | accepted by ICCV2025 |

To harness the vast pool of unlabeled remote sensing data, we propose SAMST, a semi-supervised semantic segmentation method. SAMST leverages the strengths of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in zero-shot generalization and boundary detection. SAMST iteratively refines pseudo-labels through two main components: supervised model self-training using both labeled and pseudo-labeled data, and a SAM-based Pseudo-label Refiner. The Pseudo-label Refiner comprises three modules: a Threshold Filter Module for preprocessing, a Prompt Generation Module for extracting connected regions and generating prompts for SAM, and a Label Refinement Module for final label stitching. By integrating the generalization power of large models with the training efficiency of small models, SAMST improves pseudo-label accuracy, thereby enhancing overall model performance. Experiments on the Potsdam dataset validate the effectiveness and feasibility of SAMST, demonstrating its potential to address the challenges posed by limited labeled data in remote sensing semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>IGARS...</summary><p>IGARSS2025 accepted, Correspondence: fujianhai2024@gmail.com (J.F.), cuichj@mail2.sysu.edu.cn (C.C.)</p></details> |

While psychological explanations such as the ideomotor effect exist, a computational understanding of how decentralized, implicit linguistic knowledge fuses through shared physical interaction remains elusive. We introduce CoCre-Sam (Collective-Creature Sampling), a framework modeling this phenomenon as collective Langevin dynamics sampling from implicitly fused language models. Each participant is represented as an agent associated with an energy landscape derived from an internal language model reflecting linguistic priors, and agents exert stochastic forces based on local energy gradients. We theoretically prove that the collective motion of the shared pointer (planchette) corresponds to Langevin MCMC sampling from the sum of individual energy landscapes, representing fused collective knowledge. Simulations validate that CoCre-Sam dynamics effectively fuse different models and generate meaningful character sequences, while ablation studies confirm the essential roles of collective interaction and stochasticity. Altogether, CoCre-Sam provides a novel computational mechanism linking individual implicit knowledge, embodied collective action, and emergent linguistic phenomena, grounding these complex interactions in the principles of probabilistic sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compress Any Segment Anything Model (SAM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08765v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing. Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning, distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model, and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio, post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished within 60 seconds for all models.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 tables, 8 figures</p></details> |

The recent segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated strong adaptability across diverse natural scenarios. However, the huge computational costs, demand for manual annotations as prompts and conflict-prone decoding process of SAM degrade its generalization capabilities in medical scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a modality-decoupled lightweight SAM for domain-generalized medical image segmentation, named De-LightSAM. Specifically, we first devise a lightweight domain-controllable image encoder (DC-Encoder) that produces discriminative visual features for diverse modalities. Further, we introduce the self-patch prompt generator (SP-Generator) to automatically generate high-quality dense prompt embeddings for guiding segmentation decoding. Finally, we design the query-decoupled modality decoder (QM-Decoder) that leverages a one-to-one strategy to provide an independent decoding channel for every modality, preventing mutual knowledge interference of different modalities. Moreover, we design a multi-modal decoupled knowledge distillation (MDKD) strategy to leverage robust common knowledge to complement domain-specific medical feature representations. Extensive experiments indicate that De-LightSAM outperforms state-of-the-arts in diverse medical imaging segmentation tasks, displaying superior modality universality and generalization capabilities. Especially, De-LightSAM uses only 2.0% parameters compared to SAM-H. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/De-LightSAM.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, 2D specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy, non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18 backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment.

However, accurately segmenting vessels remains challenging due to their small size, intricate edge structures, and susceptibility to artifacts and imaging noise. In this work, we propose VesselSAM, an enhanced version of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), specifically tailored for aortic vessel segmentation. VesselSAM incorporates AtrousLoRA, a novel module integrating Atrous Attention and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance segmentation performance. Atrous Attention enables the model to capture multi-scale contextual information, preserving both fine-grained local details and broader global context. Additionally, LoRA facilitates efficient fine-tuning of the frozen SAM image encoder, reducing the number of trainable parameters and thereby enhancing computational efficiency. We evaluate VesselSAM using two challenging datasets: the Aortic Vessel Tree (AVT) dataset and the Type-B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) dataset. VesselSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining DSC scores of 93.50\%, 93.25\%, 93.02\%, and 93.26\% across multi-center datasets. Our results demonstrate that VesselSAM delivers high segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to existing large-scale models. This development paves the way for enhanced AI-based aortic vessel segmentation in clinical environments. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/Adnan-CAS/AtrousLora.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is appealing as it can deal with privacy concerns and access constraints on source-domain data during adaptation to target-domain data. However, SFDA faces challenges such as insufficient supervision in the target domain with unlabeled images. In this work, we propose a Segment Anything Model (SAM)-guided Reliable Pseudo-Labels method for SFDA (SRPL-SFDA) with three key components: 1) Test-Time Tri-branch Intensity Enhancement (T3IE) that not only improves quality of raw pseudo-labels in the target domain, but also leads to SAM-compatible inputs with three channels to better leverage SAM's zero-shot inference ability for refining the pseudo-labels; 2) A reliable pseudo-label selection module that rejects low-quality pseudo-labels based on Consistency of Multiple SAM Outputs (CMSO) under input perturbations with T3IE; and 3) A reliability-aware training procedure in the unlabeled target domain where reliable pseudo-labels are used for supervision and unreliable parts are regularized by entropy minimization. Experiments conducted on two multi-domain medical image segmentation datasets for fetal brain and the prostate respectively demonstrate that: 1) SRPL-SFDA effectively enhances pseudo-label quality in the unlabeled target domain, and improves SFDA performance by leveraging the reliability-aware training; 2) SRPL-SFDA outperformed state-of-the-art SFDA methods, and its performance is close to that of supervised training in the target domain.

| **[SAM-aware Test-time Adaptation for Universal Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05221v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains. Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs. ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1) Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image segmentation.

Current monitoring methods involve ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2) temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM) information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations. We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree crown instance segmentation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Self-Prompting SAM: A Prompt-Free Medical Image Segmentation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02854v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is highly effective in natural image segmentation, it requires dependencies on prompts, which limits its applicability to medical imaging where manual prompts are often unavailable. Existing efforts to fine-tune SAM for medical segmentation typically struggle to remove this dependency. We propose Hierarchical Self-Prompting SAM (HSP-SAM), a novel self-prompting framework that enables SAM to achieve strong performance in prompt-free medical image segmentation. Unlike previous self-prompting methods that remain limited to positional prompts similar to vanilla SAM, we are the first to introduce learning abstract prompts during the self-prompting process. This simple and intuitive self-prompting framework achieves superior performance on classic segmentation tasks such as polyp and skin lesion segmentation, while maintaining robustness across diverse medical imaging modalities. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization to unseen datasets, achieving improvements of up to 14.04% over previous state-of-the-art methods on some challenging benchmarks. These results suggest that abstract prompts encapsulate richer and higher-dimensional semantic information compared to positional prompts, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and generalization performance. All models and codes will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, extending these capabilities to videos presents substantial challenges, particularly in ensuring precise and temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. SAM 2 attempts to address this by training a model on massive image and video data from scratch to learn complex spatiotemporal associations, resulting in huge training costs that hinder research and practical deployment. In this paper, we introduce SAM-I2V, an effective image-to-video upgradation method for cultivating a promptable video segmentation (PVS) model. Our approach strategically upgrades the pre-trained SAM to support PVS, significantly reducing training complexity and resource requirements. To achieve this, we introduce three key innovations: (i) an image-to-video feature extraction upgrader built upon SAM's static image encoder to enable spatiotemporal video perception, (ii) a memory filtering strategy that selects the most relevant past frames for more effective utilization of historical information, and (iii) a memory-as-prompt mechanism leveraging object memory to ensure temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves over 90% of SAM 2's performance while using only 0.2% of its training cost. Our work presents a resource-efficient pathway to PVS, lowering barriers for further research in PVS model design and enabling broader applications and advancements in the field.

To address this problem, semantic segmentation methods based on semi-supervised learning with a small number of labeled data have been proposed. For example, one approach is to train a semantic segmentation model using images with annotated labels and pseudo labels. In this approach, the accuracy of the semantic segmentation model depends on the quality of the pseudo labels, and the quality of the pseudo labels depends on the performance of the model to be trained and the amount of data with annotated labels. In this paper, we generate pseudo labels using zero-shot annotation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels using the Unified Dual-Stream Perturbations Approach (UniMatch), and use them as enhanced labels to train a semantic segmentation model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through the experiments using the public datasets: PASCAL and MS COCO.

However, existing approaches typically rely heavily on manually annotated datasets that include explicit reasoning processes, which are costly and time-consuming to produce. Recent advances suggest that reinforcement learning (RL) can endow large models with reasoning capabilities without requiring such reasoning-annotated data. In this paper, we propose SAM-R1, a novel framework that enables multimodal large models to perform fine-grained reasoning in image understanding tasks. Our approach is the first to incorporate fine-grained segmentation settings during the training of multimodal reasoning models. By integrating task-specific, fine-grained rewards with a tailored optimization objective, we further enhance the model's reasoning and segmentation alignment. We also leverage the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a strong and flexible reward provider to guide the learning process. With only 3k training samples, SAM-R1 achieves strong performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in equipping multimodal models with segmentation-oriented reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

In urology, manual segmentation is considered tedious and impractical due to the typically large scale of image databases and the continuous generation of new data. In this study, the potential of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) -- a state-of-the-art deep learning framework -- is investigated for the automation of kidney stone segmentation. The performance of SAM is evaluated in comparison to traditional models, including U-Net, Residual U-Net, and Attention U-Net, which, despite their efficiency, frequently exhibit limitations in generalizing to unseen datasets. The findings highlight SAM's superior adaptability and efficiency. While SAM achieves comparable performance to U-Net on in-distribution data (Accuracy: 97.68 + 3.04; Dice: 97.78 + 2.47; IoU: 95.76 + 4.18), it demonstrates significantly enhanced generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution data, surpassing all U-Net variants by margins of up to 23 percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, conference, MIUA25</p></details> |

However, it is often challenged by the imprecise boundaries of the extracted objects due to the lack of pixel-wise supervision and the properties of landslide objects. To tackle these issues, we propose a simple yet effective method by auto-prompting the Segment Anything Model (SAM), i.e., APSAM. Instead of depending on high-quality class activation maps (CAMs) for pseudo-labeling or fine-tuning SAM, our method directly yields fine-grained segmentation masks from SAM inference through prompt engineering. Specifically, it adaptively generates hybrid prompts from the CAMs obtained by an object localization network. To provide sufficient information for SAM prompting, an adaptive prompt generation (APG) algorithm is designed to fully leverage the visual patterns of CAMs, enabling the efficient generation of pseudo-masks for landslide extraction. These informative prompts are able to identify the extent of landslide areas (box prompts) and denote the centers of landslide objects (point prompts), guiding SAM in landslide segmentation. Experimental results on high-resolution aerial and satellite datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving improvements of at least 3.0\% in F1 score and 3.69\% in IoU compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

To address this, some methods use the well-learned knowledge of foundation models (e.g., SAM) to simplify the learning process. Recently, SAM 2 has extended SAM by supporting video segmentation, whose class-agnostic matching ability is useful to FSS. A simple idea is to encode support foreground (FG) features as memory, with which query FG features are matched and fused. Unfortunately, the FG objects in different frames of SAM 2's video data are always the same identity, while those in FSS are different identities, i.e., the matching step is incompatible. Therefore, we design Pseudo Prompt Generator to encode pseudo query memory, matching with query features in a compatible way. However, the memories can never be as accurate as the real ones, i.e., they are likely to contain incomplete query FG, and some unexpected query background (BG) features, leading to wrong segmentation. Hence, we further design Iterative Memory Refinement to fuse more query FG features into the memory, and devise a Support-Calibrated Memory Attention to suppress the unexpected query BG features in memory. Extensive experiments have been conducted on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ to validate the effectiveness of our design, e.g., the 1-shot mIoU can be 4.2% better than the best baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICML'25</p></details> |

Correspondingly, this study tackles Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The previous studies declared that SAM is not workable for COD but this study reveals that SAM works if promoted properly, for which we devise a new framework to render point promotions: First, we develop the Promotion Point Targeting Network (PPT-net) to leverage multi-scale features in predicting the probabilities of camouflaged objects' presences at given candidate points over the image. Then, we develop a key point selection (KPS) algorithm to deploy both positive and negative point promotions contrastively to SAM to guide the segmentation. It is the first work to facilitate big model for COD and achieves plausible results experimentally over the existing methods on 3 data sets under 6 metrics. This study demonstrates an off-the-shelf methodology for COD by leveraging SAM, which gains advantage over designing professional models from scratch, not only in performance, but also in turning the problem to a less challenging task, that is, seeking informative but not exactly precise promotions.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we propose Proxy Prompt (PP), auto-generated by leveraging non-target data with a pre-annotated mask. We devise a novel 3-step context-selection strategy for adaptively selecting the most representative contextual information from non-target data via vision mamba and selective maps, empowering the guiding capability of non-target image-mask pairs for segmentation on target image/video data. To reinforce human-model interactions in PP, we further propose a contextual colorization module via a dual-reverse cross-attention to enhance interactions between target features and contextual-embedding with amplifying distinctive features of user-defined object(s). Via extensive evaluations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and yields comparable results with fully-trained models, even when trained with only 16 image masks.</p></details> |  |

Current studies focus on the Class Activation Map (CAM) of CNN and the self-attention map of transformer to identify the region of objects. However, both CAM and self-attention maps can not learn pixel-level fine-grained information on the foreground objects, which hinders the further advance of WSOL. To address this problem, we initiatively leverage the capability of zero-shot generalization and fine-grained segmentation in Segment Anything Model (SAM) to boost the activation of integral object regions. Further, to alleviate the semantic ambiguity issue accrued in single point prompt-based SAM, we propose an innovative mask prompt to SAM (Pro2SAM) network with grid points for WSOL task. First, we devise a Global Token Transformer (GTFormer) to generate a coarse-grained foreground map as a flexible mask prompt, where the GTFormer jointly embeds patch tokens and novel global tokens to learn foreground semantics. Secondly, we deliver grid points as dense prompts into SAM to maximize the probability of foreground mask, which avoids the lack of objects caused by a single point/box prompt. Finally, we propose a pixel-level similarity metric to come true the mask matching from mask prompt to SAM, where the mask with the highest score is viewed as the final localization map. Experiments show that the proposed Pro2SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC, with 84.03\% and 66.85\% Top-1 Loc, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Volumetric Medical Image Annotation via Short-Long Memory SAM 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01854v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manual annotation of volumetric medical images, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Recent advancements in foundation models for video object segmentation, such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), offer a potential opportunity to significantly speed up the annotation process by manually annotating one or a few slices and then propagating target masks across the entire volume. However, the performance of SAM 2 in this context varies. Our experiments show that relying on a single memory bank and attention module is prone to error propagation, particularly at boundary regions where the target is present in the previous slice but absent in the current one. To address this problem, we propose Short-Long Memory SAM 2 (SLM-SAM 2), a novel architecture that integrates distinct short-term and long-term memory banks with separate attention modules to improve segmentation accuracy. We evaluate SLM-SAM 2 on three public datasets covering organs, bones, and muscles across MRI and CT modalities. We show that the proposed method markedly outperforms the default SAM 2, achieving average Dice Similarity Coefficient improvement of 0.14 and 0.11 in the scenarios when 5 volumes and 1 volume are available for the initial adaptation, respectively. SLM-SAM 2 also exhibits stronger resistance to over-propagation, making a notable step toward more accurate automated annotation of medical images for segmentation model development.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces SAM-TIFF, a novel teacher-student distillation framework for pixel-level wildfire temperature prediction and segmentation using RGB input only. A multimodal teacher network trained on paired RGB-Thermal imagery and radiometric TIFF ground truth distills knowledge to a unimodal RGB student network, enabling thermal-sensor-free inference. Segmentation supervision is generated using a hybrid approach of segment anything (SAM)-guided mask generation, and selection via TOPSIS, along with Canny edge detection and Otsu's thresholding pipeline for automatic point prompt selection. Our method is the first to perform per-pixel temperature regression from RGB UAV data, demonstrating strong generalization on the recent FLAME 3 dataset. This work lays the foundation for lightweight, cost-effective UAV-based wildfire monitoring systems without thermal sensors.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, its performance in the field of image manipulation detection remains largely unexplored and unconfirmed. There are two main challenges in applying SAM to image manipulation detection: a) reliance on manual prompts, and b) the difficulty of single-view information in supporting cross-dataset generalization. To address these challenges, we develops a cross-view prompt learning paradigm called IMDPrompter based on SAM. Benefiting from the design of automated prompts, IMDPrompter no longer relies on manual guidance, enabling automated detection and localization. Additionally, we propose components such as Cross-view Feature Perception, Optimal Prompt Selection, and Cross-View Prompt Consistency, which facilitate cross-view perceptual learning and guide SAM to generate accurate masks. Extensive experimental results from five datasets (CASIA, Columbia, Coverage, IMD2020, and NIST16) validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAM-Guided Robust Representation Learning for One-Shot 3D Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20501v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-shot medical image segmentation (MIS) is crucial for medical analysis due to the burden of medical experts on manual annotation. The recent emergence of the segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable adaptation in MIS but cannot be directly applied to one-shot medical image segmentation (MIS) due to its reliance on labor-intensive user interactions and the high computational cost. To cope with these limitations, we propose a novel SAM-guided robust representation learning framework, named RRL-MedSAM, to adapt SAM to one-shot 3D MIS, which exploits the strong generalization capabilities of the SAM encoder to learn better feature representation. We devise a dual-stage knowledge distillation (DSKD) strategy to distill general knowledge between natural and medical images from the foundation model to train a lightweight encoder, and then adopt a mutual exponential moving average (mutual-EMA) to update the weights of the general lightweight encoder and medical-specific encoder. Specifically, pseudo labels from the registration network are used to perform mutual supervision for such two encoders. Moreover, we introduce an auto-prompting (AP) segmentation decoder which adopts the mask generated from the general lightweight model as a prompt to assist the medical-specific model in boosting the final segmentation performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets, i.e., OASIS, CT-lung demonstrate that the proposed RRL-MedSAM outperforms state-of-the-art one-shot MIS methods for both segmentation and registration tasks. Especially, our lightweight encoder uses only 3\% of the parameters compared to the encoder of SAM-Base.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Tuning SAM: From Generalist to Specialist with only 2048 Parameters and 16 Training Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16739v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is widely used for segmenting a diverse range of objects in natural images from simple user prompts like points or bounding boxes. However, SAM's performance decreases substantially when applied to non-natural domains like microscopic imaging. Furthermore, due to SAM's interactive design, it requires a precise prompt for each image and object, which is unfeasible in many automated biomedical applications. Previous solutions adapt SAM by training millions of parameters via fine-tuning large parts of the model or of adapter layers. In contrast, we show that as little as 2,048 additional parameters are sufficient for turning SAM into a use-case specialist for a certain downstream task. Our novel PTSAM (prompt-tuned SAM) method uses prompt-tuning, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, to adapt SAM for a specific task. We validate the performance of our approach on multiple microscopic and one medical dataset. Our results show that prompt-tuning only SAM's mask decoder already leads to a performance on-par with state-of-the-art techniques while requiring roughly 2,000x less trainable parameters. For addressing domain gaps, we find that additionally prompt-tuning SAM's image encoder is beneficial, further improving segmentation accuracy by up to 18% over state-of-the-art results. Since PTSAM can be reliably trained with as little as 16 annotated images, we find it particularly helpful for applications with limited training data and domain shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable Adversarial Attacks on SAM and Its Downstream Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20197v3)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The utilization of large foundational models has a dilemma: while fine-tuning downstream tasks from them holds promise for making use of the well-generalized knowledge in practical applications, their open accessibility also poses threats of adverse usage. This paper, for the first time, explores the feasibility of adversarial attacking various downstream models fine-tuned from the segment anything model (SAM), by solely utilizing the information from the open-sourced SAM. In contrast to prevailing transfer-based adversarial attacks, we demonstrate the existence of adversarial dangers even without accessing the downstream task and dataset to train a similar surrogate model. To enhance the effectiveness of the adversarial attack towards models fine-tuned on unknown datasets, we propose a universal meta-initialization (UMI) algorithm to extract the intrinsic vulnerability inherent in the foundation model, which is then utilized as the prior knowledge to guide the generation of adversarial perturbations. Moreover, by formulating the gradient difference in the attacking process between the open-sourced SAM and its fine-tuned downstream models, we theoretically demonstrate that a deviation occurs in the adversarial update direction by directly maximizing the distance of encoded feature embeddings in the open-sourced SAM. Consequently, we propose a gradient robust loss that simulates the associated uncertainty with gradient-based noise augmentation to enhance the robustness of generated adversarial examples (AEs) towards this deviation, thus improving the transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed universal meta-initialized and gradient robust adversarial attack (UMI-GRAT) toward SAMs and their downstream models.

| **[SAUGE: Taming SAM for Uncertainty-Aligned Multi-Granularity Edge Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12892v3)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge labels are typically at various granularity levels owing to the varying preferences of annotators, thus handling the subjectivity of per-pixel labels has been a focal point for edge detection. Previous methods often employ a simple voting strategy to diminish such label uncertainty or impose a strong assumption of labels with a pre-defined distribution, e.g., Gaussian. In this work, we unveil that the segment anything model (SAM) provides strong prior knowledge to model the uncertainty in edge labels. Our key insight is that the intermediate SAM features inherently correspond to object edges at various granularities, which reflects different edge options due to uncertainty. Therefore, we attempt to align uncertainty with granularity by regressing intermediate SAM features from different layers to object edges at multi-granularity levels. In doing so, the model can fully and explicitly explore diverse ``uncertainties'' in a data-driven fashion. Specifically, we inject a lightweight module (~ 1.5% additional parameters) into the frozen SAM to progressively fuse and adapt its intermediate features to estimate edges from coarse to fine. It is crucial to normalize the granularity level of human edge labels to match their innate uncertainty. For this, we simply perform linear blending to the real edge labels at hand to create pseudo labels with varying granularities. Consequently, our uncertainty-aligned edge detector can flexibly produce edges at any desired granularity (including an optimal one). Thanks to SAM, our model uniquely demonstrates strong generalizability for cross-dataset edge detection. Extensive experimental results on BSDS500, Muticue and NYUDv2 validate our model's superiority.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[SAM-Based Building Change Detection with Distribution-Aware Fourier Adaptation and Edge-Constrained Warping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12619v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building change detection remains challenging for urban development, disaster assessment, and military reconnaissance. While foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) show strong segmentation capabilities, SAM is limited in the task of building change detection due to domain gap issues. Existing adapter-based fine-tuning approaches face challenges with imbalanced building distribution, resulting in poor detection of subtle changes and inaccurate edge extraction. Additionally, bi-temporal misalignment in change detection, typically addressed by optical flow, remains vulnerable to background noises. This affects the detection of building changes and compromises both detection accuracy and edge recognition. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new SAM-Based Network with Distribution-Aware Fourier Adaptation and Edge-Constrained Warping (FAEWNet) for building change detection. FAEWNet utilizes the SAM encoder to extract rich visual features from remote sensing images. To guide SAM in focusing on specific ground objects in remote sensing scenes, we propose a Distribution-Aware Fourier Aggregated Adapter to aggregate task-oriented changed information. This adapter not only effectively addresses the domain gap issue, but also pays attention to the distribution of changed buildings. Furthermore, to mitigate noise interference and misalignment in height offset estimation, we design a novel flow module that refines building edge extraction and enhances the perception of changed buildings. Our state-of-the-art results on the LEVIR-CD, S2Looking and WHU-CD datasets highlight the effectiveness of FAEWNet. The code is available at https://github.com/SUPERMAN123000/FAEWNet.</p></details> |  |

One promising strategy for SDG is to leverage consistent semantic shape priors across different imaging protocols, scanner vendors, and clinical sites. However, existing dictionary learning methods that encode shape priors often suffer from limited representational power with a small set of offline computed shape elements, or overfitting when the dictionary size grows. Moreover, they are not readily compatible with large foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM). In this paper, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Shape-Experts (MoSE) framework that seamlessly integrates the idea of mixture-of-experts (MoE) training into dictionary learning to efficiently capture diverse and robust shape priors. Our method conceptualizes each dictionary atom as a shape expert, which specializes in encoding distinct semantic shape information. A gating network dynamically fuses these shape experts into a robust shape map, with sparse activation guided by SAM encoding to prevent overfitting. We further provide this shape map as a prompt to SAM, utilizing the powerful generalization capability of SAM through bidirectional integration. All modules, including the shape dictionary, are trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 workshop</p></details> |

This paper presents SAM-CP, a simple approach that establishes two types of composable prompts beyond SAM and composes them for versatile segmentation. Specifically, given a set of classes (in texts) and a set of SAM patches, the Type-I prompt judges whether a SAM patch aligns with a text label, and the Type-II prompt judges whether two SAM patches with the same text label also belong to the same instance. To decrease the complexity in dealing with a large number of semantic classes and patches, we establish a unified framework that calculates the affinity between (semantic and instance) queries and SAM patches and merges patches with high affinity to the query. Experiments show that SAM-CP achieves semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation in both open and closed domains. In particular, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary segmentation. Our research offers a novel and generalized methodology for equipping vision foundation models like SAM with multi-grained semantic perception abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025; codes:https://github.com/ucas-vg/SAM-CP</p></details> |

Open-vocabulary image Segmentation addresses these generalization issues in traditional supervised segmentation models while reducing reliance on extensive per-pixel annotations, which are both expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. Most Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) methods are designed for natural images but struggle with remote sensing data due to scale variations, orientation changes, and complex scene compositions. This necessitates the development of OVS approaches specifically tailored for remote sensing. In this context, we propose AerOSeg, a novel OVS approach for remote sensing data. First, we compute robust image-text correlation features using multiple rotated versions of the input image and domain-specific prompts. These features are then refined through spatial and class refinement blocks. Inspired by the success of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in diverse domains, we leverage SAM features to guide the spatial refinement of correlation features. Additionally, we introduce a semantic back-projection module and loss to ensure the seamless propagation of SAM's semantic information throughout the segmentation pipeline. Finally, we enhance the refined correlation features using a multi-scale attention-aware decoder to produce the final segmentation map. We validate our SAM-guided Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Segmentation model on three benchmark remote sensing datasets: iSAID, DLRSD, and OpenEarthMap. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.54 h-mIoU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EarthVision workshop, CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Given SAM's wide applications, understanding its robustness against adversarial attacks is crucial for real-world deployment. However, research on SAM's robustness is still in its early stages. Existing attacks often overlook the role of prompts in evaluating SAM's robustness, and there has been insufficient exploration of defense methods to balance the robustness and accuracy. To address these gaps, this paper proposes an adversarial robustness framework designed to evaluate and enhance the robustness of SAM. Specifically, we introduce a cross-prompt attack method to enhance the attack transferability across different prompt types. Besides attacking, we propose a few-parameter adaptation strategy to defend SAM against various adversarial attacks. To balance robustness and accuracy, we use the singular value decomposition (SVD) to constrain the space of trainable parameters, where only singular values are adaptable. Experiments demonstrate that our cross-prompt attack method outperforms previous approaches in terms of attack success rate on both SAM and SAM 2. By adapting only 512 parameters, we achieve at least a 15\% improvement in mean intersection over union (mIoU) against various adversarial attacks. Compared to previous defense methods, our approach enhances the robustness of SAM while maximally maintaining its original performance.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

Current teacher-student frameworks still suffer from performance constraints due to unreliable pseudo-label quality stemming from limited labeled data. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers robust segmentation capabilities at various granularities, directly applying SAM to this task introduces challenges such as class-agnostic predictions and potential over-segmentation. To address these complexities, we carefully integrate SAM into the semi-supervised instance segmentation framework, developing a novel distillation method that effectively captures the precise localization capabilities of SAM without compromising semantic recognition. Furthermore, we incorporate pseudo-label refinement as well as a specialized data augmentation with the refined pseudo-labels, resulting in superior performance. We establish state-of-the-art performance, and provide comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[CMaP-SAM: Contraction Mapping Prior for SAM-driven Few-shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05049v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment new classes using few annotated images. While recent FSS methods have shown considerable improvements by leveraging Segment Anything Model (SAM), they face two critical limitations: insufficient utilization of structural correlations in query images, and significant information loss when converting continuous position priors to discrete point prompts. To address these challenges, we propose CMaP-SAM, a novel framework that introduces contraction mapping theory to optimize position priors for SAM-driven few-shot segmentation. CMaP-SAM consists of three key components: (1) a contraction mapping module that formulates position prior optimization as a Banach contraction mapping with convergence guarantees. This module iteratively refines position priors through pixel-wise structural similarity, generating a converged prior that preserves both semantic guidance from reference images and structural correlations in query images; (2) an adaptive distribution alignment module bridging continuous priors with SAM's binary mask prompt encoder; and (3) a foreground-background decoupled refinement architecture producing accurate final segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate CMaP-SAM's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 71.1 mIoU on PASCAL-$5^i$ and 56.1 on COCO-$20^i$ datasets.</p></details> | 7 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose U-SAM, a novel framework that imbibes semantic awareness into SAM, enabling it to generate targeted masks for user-specified object categories. Given only object class names as input from the user, U-SAM provides pixel-level semantic annotations for images without requiring any labeled/unlabeled samples from the test data distribution. Our approach leverages synthetically generated or web crawled images to accumulate semantic information about the desired object classes. We then learn a mapping function between SAM's mask embeddings and object class labels, effectively enhancing SAM with granularity-specific semantic recognition capabilities. As a result, users can obtain meaningful and targeted segmentation masks for specific objects they request, rather than generic and unlabeled masks. We evaluate U-SAM on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MSCOCO-80, achieving significant mIoU improvements of +17.95% and +5.20%, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods. By transforming SAM into a semantically aware segmentation model, U-SAM offers a practical and flexible solution for pixel-level annotation across diverse and unseen domains in a resource-constrained environment.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches in image manipulation detection have largely been driven by fully supervised approaches, which require labor-intensive pixel-level annotations. Thus, it is essential to explore weakly supervised image manipulation localization methods that only require image-level binary labels for training. However, existing weakly supervised image manipulation methods overlook the importance of edge information for accurate localization, leading to suboptimal localization performance. To address this, we propose a Context-Aware Boundary Localization (CABL) module to aggregate boundary features and learn context-inconsistency for localizing manipulated areas. Furthermore, by leveraging Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and Segment Anything Model (SAM), we introduce the CAM-Guided SAM Refinement (CGSR) module to generate more accurate manipulation localization maps. By integrating two modules, we present a novel weakly supervised framework based on a dual-branch Transformer-CNN architecture. Our method achieves outstanding localization performance across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods address this by sequentially connecting a powerful mask proposal generator, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP. But these two-stage approaches often suffer from high computational costs, memory inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose ESC-Net, a novel one-stage open-vocabulary segmentation model that leverages the SAM decoder blocks for class-agnostic segmentation within an efficient inference framework. By embedding pseudo prompts generated from image-text correlations into SAM's promptable segmentation framework, ESC-Net achieves refined spatial aggregation for accurate mask predictions. ESC-Net achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks, including ADE20K, PASCAL-VOC, and PASCAL-Context, outperforming prior methods in both efficiency and accuracy.

However, although SAM excels in fine-grained segmentation, it faces major challenges when applying it to semantic-aware segmentation. While CLIP exhibits a strong semantic understanding capability via aligning the global features of language and vision, it has deficiencies in fine-grained segmentation tasks. Human parsing requires to segment human bodies into constituent parts and involves both accurate fine-grained segmentation and high semantic understanding of each part. Based on traits of SAM and CLIP, we formulate high efficient modules to effectively integrate features of them to benefit human parsing. We propose a Semantic-Refinement Module to integrate semantic features of CLIP with SAM features to benefit parsing. Moreover, we formulate a high efficient Fine-tuning Module to adjust the pretrained SAM for human parsing that needs high semantic information and simultaneously demands spatial details, which significantly reduces the training time compared with full-time training and achieves notable performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on LIP, PPP, and CIHP databases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving SAM for Camouflaged Object Detection via Dual Stream Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06042v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment anything model (SAM) has shown impressive general-purpose segmentation performance on natural images, but its performance on camouflaged object detection (COD) is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose SAM-COD that performs camouflaged object detection for RGB-D inputs. While keeping the SAM architecture intact, dual stream adapters are expanded on the image encoder to learn potential complementary information from RGB images and depth images, and fine-tune the mask decoder and its depth replica to perform dual-stream mask prediction. In practice, the dual stream adapters are embedded into the attention block of the image encoder in a parallel manner to facilitate the refinement and correction of the two types of image embeddings. To mitigate channel discrepancies arising from dual stream embeddings that do not directly interact with each other, we augment the association of dual stream embeddings using bidirectional knowledge distillation including a model distiller and a modal distiller. In addition, to predict the masks for RGB and depth attention maps, we hybridize the two types of image embeddings which are jointly learned with the prompt embeddings to update the initial prompt, and then feed them into the mask decoders to synchronize the consistency of image embeddings and prompt embeddings. Experimental results on four COD benchmarks show that our SAM-COD achieves excellent detection performance gains over SAM and achieves state-of-the-art results with a given fine-tuning paradigm.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods address this issue through modality fusion, integrating textual and image information to provide more detailed priors. In this study, we argue that the granularity of text and the domain gap affect the accuracy of the priors. Furthermore, the discrepancy between high-level abstract semantics and pixel-level boundary details in images can introduce noise into the fusion process. To address this, we propose Prior-Guided SAM (PG-SAM), which employs a fine-grained modality prior aligner to leverage specialized medical knowledge for better modality alignment. The core of our method lies in efficiently addressing the domain gap with fine-grained text from a medical LLM. Meanwhile, it also enhances the priors' quality after modality alignment, ensuring more accurate segmentation. In addition, our decoder enhances the model's expressive capabilities through multi-level feature fusion and iterative mask optimizer operations, supporting unprompted learning. We also propose a unified pipeline that effectively supplies high-quality semantic information to SAM. Extensive experiments on the Synapse dataset demonstrate that the proposed PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Current monitoring methods involve measuring trees by hand for each species, requiring extensive cost, time, and labour. Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping and characterizing trees from aerial imagery, and large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), may be a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare SAM methods for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery of young tree plantations. We explore the potential of SAM for this task, and find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts, but that there is potential for methods which tune SAM further.

Although early research prioritized visual quality, preserving fine details and adapting to downstream tasks remains challenging. Recent approaches attempt task-specific design but rarely achieve "The Best of Both Worlds" due to inconsistent optimization goals. To address these issues, we propose a novel method that leverages the semantic knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to Grow the quality of fusion results and Enable downstream task adaptability, namely SAGE. Specifically, we design a Semantic Persistent Attention (SPA) Module that efficiently maintains source information via the persistent repository while extracting high-level semantic priors from SAM. More importantly, to eliminate the impractical dependence on SAM during inference, we introduce a bi-level optimization-driven distillation mechanism with triplet losses, which allow the student network to effectively extract knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a balance between high-quality visual results and downstream task adaptability while maintaining practical deployment efficiency.

However, SAM does not work when directly applied to medical image segmentation, since SAM lacks the ability to predict semantic labels, requires additional prompts, and presents suboptimal performance. Following the above issues, we propose MaskSAM, a novel mask classification prompt-free SAM adaptation framework for medical image segmentation. We design a prompt generator combined with the image encoder in SAM to generate a set of auxiliary classifier tokens, auxiliary binary masks, and auxiliary bounding boxes. Each pair of auxiliary mask and box prompts can solve the requirements of extra prompts. The semantic label prediction can be addressed by the sum of the auxiliary classifier tokens and the learnable global classifier tokens in the mask decoder of SAM. Meanwhile, we design a 3D depth-convolution adapter for image embeddings and a 3D depth-MLP adapter for prompt embeddings to efficiently fine-tune SAM. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AMOS2022, 90.52% Dice, which improved by 2.7% compared to nnUNet. Our method surpasses nnUNet by 1.7% on ACDC and 1.0% on Synapse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surgical SAM 2: Real-time Segment Anything in Surgical Video by Efficient Frame Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07931v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery and is vital for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has shown superior advancements in image and video segmentation. However, SAM2 struggles with efficiency due to the high computational demands of processing high-resolution images and complex and long-range temporal dynamics in surgical videos. To address these challenges, we introduce Surgical SAM 2 (SurgSAM2), an advanced model to utilize SAM2 with an Efficient Frame Pruning (EFP) mechanism, to facilitate real-time surgical video segmentation. The EFP mechanism dynamically manages the memory bank by selectively retaining only the most informative frames, reducing memory usage and computational cost while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgSAM2 significantly improves both efficiency and segmentation accuracy compared to the vanilla SAM2. Remarkably, SurgSAM2 achieves a 3$\times$ FPS compared with SAM2, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance after fine-tuning with lower-resolution data. These advancements establish SurgSAM2 as a leading model for surgical video analysis, making real-time surgical video segmentation in resource-constrained environments a reality.

However, such models are supervised in nature, still relying on large annotated datasets or prompts supplied by experts. Conventional techniques such as active learning to alleviate such limitations are limited in scope and still necessitate continuous human involvement and complex domain knowledge for label refinement or establishing reward ground truth. To address these challenges, we propose an enhanced Segment Anything Model (SAM) framework that utilizes annotation-efficient prompts generated in a fully unsupervised fashion, while still capturing essential semantic, location, and shape information through contrastive language-image pretraining and visual question answering. We adopt the direct preference optimization technique to design an optimal policy that enables the model to generate high-fidelity segmentations with simple ratings or rankings provided by a virtual annotator simulating the human annotation process. State-of-the-art performance of our framework in tasks such as lung segmentation, breast tumor segmentation, and organ segmentation across various modalities, including X-ray, ultrasound, and abdominal CT, justifies its effectiveness in low-annotation data scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Currently, several recent works have utilized the segmenting anything model (SAM) to boost the segmentation performance in medical images, where most of them focus on training an adaptor for fine-tuning a large amount of pixel-wise annotated medical images following a fully supervised manner. In this paper, to reduce the labeling cost, we investigate a novel weakly-supervised SAM-based segmentation model, namely WeakMedSAM. Specifically, our proposed WeakMedSAM contains two modules: 1) to mitigate severe co-occurrence in medical images, a sub-class exploration module is introduced to learn accurate feature representations. 2) to improve the quality of the class activation maps, our prompt affinity mining module utilizes the prompt capability of SAM to obtain an affinity map for random-walk refinement. Our method can be applied to any SAM-like backbone, and we conduct experiments with SAMUS and EfficientSAM. The experimental results on three popularly-used benchmark datasets, i.e., BraTS 2019, AbdomenCT-1K, and MSD Cardiac dataset, show the promising results of our proposed WeakMedSAM.

However, current scribble-supervised learning methods are limited in their ability to effectively propagate sparse annotation labels to dense segmentation masks and accurately segment object boundaries. To address these issues, we propose a Progressive Collaborative Learning framework that leverages novel algorithms and the Med-SAM foundation model to enhance information quality during training. (1) We enrich ground truth scribble segmentation labels through a new algorithm, propagating scribbles to estimate object boundaries. (2) We enhance feature representation by optimizing Med-SAM-guided training through the fusion of feature embeddings from Med-SAM and our proposed Sparse Mamba network. This enriched representation also facilitates the fine-tuning of the Med-SAM decoder with enriched scribbles. (3) For inference, we introduce a Sparse Mamba network, which is highly capable of capturing local and global dependencies by replacing the traditional sequential patch processing method with a skip-sampling procedure. Experiments on the ACDC, CHAOS, and MSCMRSeg datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, outperforming nine state-of-the-art methods.

This can make the model selection process slow, non-extensive and highly subjective, while producing unrealistic looking parameter estimates with discrete jumps. We propose to model age-dependent SAM parameters using smoothing spline functions. This can lead to more smooth parameter estimates, while speeding up and making the model selection process more automatic and less subjective. We develop different spline models and compare them with already existing SAM models for a selection of 17 different fish stocks, using cross- and forward-validation methods. The results show that our automated spline models overall outcompete the officially developed SAM models. We also demonstrate how the developed spline models can be employed as a diagnostics tool for improving and better understanding properties of the officially developed SAM models.</p></details> |  |

While CLIP, SAM, and Grad- CAM are established components, their integration within this structured pipeline represents a significant contribution to the field. The resulting segmented masks, generated through this combined approach, can be effectively utilized as inputs for robotic systems, enabling more precise and adaptive object manipulation in the context of convenience store products.</p></details> |  |
| **[LORENZA: Enhancing Generalization in Low-Rank Gradient LLM Training via Efficient Zeroth-Order Adaptive SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19571v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study robust parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques designed to improve accuracy and generalization while operating within strict computational and memory hardware constraints, specifically focusing on large-language models (LLMs). Existing PEFT methods often lack robustness and fail to generalize effectively across diverse tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. To address this, we present a new highly computationally efficient framework called AdaZo-SAM, combining Adam and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) while requiring only a single-gradient computation in every iteration. This is achieved using a stochastic zeroth-order estimation to find SAM's ascent perturbation. We provide a convergence guarantee for AdaZo-SAM and show that it improves the generalization ability of state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Additionally, we design a low-rank gradient optimization method named LORENZA, which is a memory-efficient version of AdaZo-SAM. LORENZA utilizes a randomized SVD scheme to efficiently compute the subspace projection matrix and apply optimization steps onto the selected subspace. This technique enables full-parameter fine-tuning with adaptive low-rank gradient updates, achieving the same reduced memory consumption as gradient-low-rank-projection methods. We provide a convergence analysis of LORENZA and demonstrate its merits for pre-training and fine-tuning LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monge SAM: Robust Reparameterization-Invariant Sharpness-Aware Minimization Based on Loss Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08448v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on deep neural networks show that flat minima of the loss landscape correlate with improved generalization. Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) efficiently finds flat regions by updating the parameters according to the gradient at an adversarial perturbation. The perturbation depends on the Euclidean metric, making SAM non-invariant under reparametrizations, which blurs sharpness and generalization. We propose Monge SAM (M-SAM), a reparametrization invariant version of SAM by considering a Riemannian metric in the parameter space induced naturally by the loss surface. Compared to previous approaches, M-SAM works under any modeling choice, relies only on mild assumptions while being as computationally efficient as SAM. We theoretically argue that M-SAM varies between SAM and gradient descent (GD), which increases robustness to hyperparameter selection and reduces attraction to suboptimal equilibria like saddle points. We demonstrate this behavior both theoretically and empirically on a multi-modal representation alignment task.</p></details> |  |
| **[RFMedSAM 2: Automatic Prompt Refinement for Enhanced Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation with SAM 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02741v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), a prompt-driven foundation model extending SAM to both image and video domains, has shown superior zero-shot performance compared to its predecessor. Building on SAM's success in medical image segmentation, SAM 2 presents significant potential for further advancement. However, similar to SAM, SAM 2 is limited by its output of binary masks, inability to infer semantic labels, and dependence on precise prompts for the target object area. Additionally, direct application of SAM and SAM 2 to medical image segmentation tasks yields suboptimal results. In this paper, we explore the upper performance limit of SAM 2 using custom fine-tuning adapters, achieving a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 92.30% on the BTCV dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art nnUNet by 12%. Following this, we address the prompt dependency by investigating various prompt generators. We introduce a UNet to autonomously generate predicted masks and bounding boxes, which serve as input to SAM 2. Subsequent dual-stage refinements by SAM 2 further enhance performance. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the AMOS2022 dataset, with a Dice improvement of 2.9% compared to nnUNet, and outperforms nnUNet by 6.4% on the BTCV dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Avoiding spurious sharpness minimization broadens applicability of SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02407v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvature regularization techniques like Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) have shown great promise in improving generalization on vision tasks. However, we find that SAM performs poorly in domains like natural language processing (NLP), often degrading performance -- even with twice the compute budget. We investigate the discrepancy across domains and find that in the NLP setting, SAM is dominated by regularization of the logit statistics -- instead of improving the geometry of the function itself. We use this observation to develop an alternative algorithm we call Functional-SAM, which regularizes curvature only through modification of the statistics of the overall function implemented by the neural network, and avoids spurious minimization through logit manipulation. Furthermore, we argue that preconditioning the SAM perturbation also prevents spurious minimization, and when combined with Functional-SAM, it gives further improvements. Our proposed algorithms show improved performance over AdamW and SAM baselines when trained for an equal number of steps, in both fixed-length and Chinchilla-style training settings, at various model scales (including billion-parameter scale). On the whole, our work highlights the importance of more precise characterizations of sharpness in broadening the applicability of curvature regularization to large language models (LLMs).</p></details> |  |

Given the 3D point cloud and multiple posed RGB-D frames of 3D scenes, our approach segments 3D instances by applying the pretrained Segment Anything Model (SAM) to 2D frames. Our key idea involves locating SAM prompts in 3D to align their projected pixel prompts across frames, ensuring the view consistency of SAM-predicted masks. Moreover, we suggest selecting prompts from the initial set guided by the information of SAM-predicted masks across all views, which enhances the overall performance. We further propose to consolidate different prompts if they are segmenting different surface parts of the same 3D instance, bringing a more comprehensive segmentation. Notably, our method does not require any additional training. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that our method achieves comparable or better performance compared to previous zero-shot or fully supervised approaches, and in many cases surpasses human annotations. Furthermore, since our fine-grained predictions often lack annotations in available datasets, we present ScanNet200-Fine50 test data which provides fine-grained annotations on 50 scenes from ScanNet200 dataset.

This paper presents Synthetic Anomaly Monitoring (SAM), an innovative approach that applies synthetic control methods from causal inference to improve both the accuracy and interpretability of anomaly detection processes. By modeling normal behavior through the treatment of each feature as a control unit, SAM identifies anomalies as deviations within this causal framework. We conducted extensive experiments comparing SAM with established benchmark models, including Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), across five diverse datasets, including Credit Card Fraud, HTTP Dataset CSIC 2010, and KDD Cup 1999, among others.

To effectively deploy these models in real-world scenarios, it is essential to employ cross-domain adaptation techniques that bridge the gap between training data and real-world data. Recently, self-training with pseudo-labels has emerged as a predominant method for cross-domain adaptation in multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation. However, generating reliable pseudo-labels necessitates stringent constraints, which often result in sparse pseudo-labels after pruning. This sparsity can potentially hinder performance improvement during the adaptation process. We propose an image-guided pseudo-label enhancement approach that leverages the complementary 2D prior knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to introduce more reliable pseudo-labels, thereby boosting domain adaptation performance. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and the SAM masks from its paired image data, we collect all 3D points covered by each SAM mask that potentially belong to the same object. Then our method refines the pseudo-labels within each SAM mask in two steps. First, we determine the class label for each mask using majority voting and employ various constraints to filter out unreliable mask labels. Next, we introduce Geometry-Aware Progressive Propagation (GAPP) which propagates the mask label to all 3D points within the SAM mask while avoiding outliers caused by 2D-3D misalignment. Experiments conducted across multiple datasets and domain adaptation scenarios demonstrate that our proposed method significantly increases the quantity of high-quality pseudo-labels and enhances the adaptation performance over baseline methods.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |
| **[Vision and Language Reference Prompt into SAM for Few-shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00719v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a large-scale segmentation model that enables powerful zero-shot capabilities with flexible prompts. While SAM can segment any object in zero-shot, it requires user-provided prompts for each target image and does not attach any label information to masks. Few-shot segmentation models addressed these issues by inputting annotated reference images as prompts to SAM and can segment specific objects in target images without user-provided prompts. Previous SAM-based few-shot segmentation models only use annotated reference images as prompts, resulting in limited accuracy due to a lack of reference information. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot segmentation model, Vision and Language reference Prompt into SAM (VLP-SAM), that utilizes the visual information of the reference images and the semantic information of the text labels by inputting not only images but also language as reference information. In particular, VLP-SAM is a simple and scalable structure with minimal learnable parameters, which inputs prompt embeddings with vision-language information into SAM using a multimodal vision-language model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of VLP-SAM, we conducted experiments on the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets, and achieved high performance in the few-shot segmentation task, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art model by a large margin (6.3% and 9.5% in mIoU, respectively). Furthermore, VLP-SAM demonstrates its generality in unseen objects that are not included in the training data.

However, as a very important branch of image segmentation, the performance of SAM remains uncertain when applied to medical image segmentation due to the significant differences between natural images and medical images. Meanwhile, it is harsh to meet the SAM's requirements of extra prompts provided, such as points or boxes to specify medical regions. In this paper, we propose a novel self-prompt SAM adaptation framework for medical image segmentation, named Self-Prompt-SAM. We design a multi-scale prompt generator combined with the image encoder in SAM to generate auxiliary masks. Then, we use the auxiliary masks to generate bounding boxes as box prompts and use Distance Transform to select the most central points as point prompts. Meanwhile, we design a 3D depth-fused adapter (DfusedAdapter) and inject the DFusedAdapter into each transformer in the image encoder and mask decoder to enable pre-trained 2D SAM models to extract 3D information and adapt to 3D medical images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms nnUNet by 2.3% on AMOS2022, 1.6% on ACDCand 0.5% on Synapse datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, its significant computational requirements limit its deployment in real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel knowledge distillation approach, KD SAM, which incorporates both encoder and decoder optimization through a combination of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Perceptual Loss. This dual-loss framework captures structural and semantic features, enabling the student model to maintain high segmentation accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Based on the model evaluation on datasets, including Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2017, Fetal Head Ultrasound, and Breast Ultrasound, we demonstrate that KD SAM achieves comparable or superior performance to the baseline models, with significantly fewer parameters. KD SAM effectively balances segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for real-time medical image segmentation applications in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Unsupervised segmentation is promising to avoid human annotations while the performance is often limited. In this study, we present a novel unsupervised segmentation approach that leverages the capabilities of foundation models, and it consists of three main steps: (1) A vision-language model (i.e., CLIP) is employed to obtain image-level pseudo-labels for training a classification network. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) is then employed to extract Regions of Interest (ROIs), where an adaptive masking-based data augmentation is used to enhance ROI identification.(2) The ROIs are used to generate bounding box and point prompts for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain segmentation pseudo-labels. (3) A 3D segmentation network is trained with the SAM-derived pseudo-labels, where low-quality pseudo-labels are filtered out in a self-learning process based on the similarity between the SAM's output and the network's prediction. Evaluation on the BraTS2020 dataset demonstrates that our approach obtained an average Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 85.60%, outperforming five state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods by more than 10 percentage points. Besides, our approach outperforms directly using SAM for zero-shot inference, and its performance is close to fully supervised learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>22st ...</summary><p>22st IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2025)</p></details> |

To reduce the annotation cost and maintain satisfactory performance, in this work, we leverage the capabilities of SAM for establishing semi-supervised medical image segmentation models. Rethinking the requirements of effectiveness, efficiency, and compatibility, we propose a three-stage framework, i.e., Stitching, Fine-tuning, and Re-training (SFR). The current fine-tuning approaches mostly involve 2D slice-wise fine-tuning that disregards the contextual information between adjacent slices. Our stitching strategy mitigates the mismatch between natural and 3D medical images. The stitched images are then used for fine-tuning SAM, providing robust initialization of pseudo-labels. Afterwards, we train a 3D semi-supervised segmentation model while maintaining the same parameter size as the conventional segmenter such as V-Net. Our SFR framework is plug-and-play, and easily compatible with various popular semi-supervised methods. We also develop an extended framework SFR$^+$ with selective fine-tuning and re-training through confidence estimation. Extensive experiments validate that our SFR and SFR$^+$ achieve significant improvements in both moderate annotation and scarce annotation across five datasets. In particular, SFR framework improves the Dice score of Mean Teacher from 29.68% to 74.40% with only one labeled data of LA dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, unlike traditional vision tasks, skin images in general present unique challenges due to the limited availability of well-annotated datasets, complex variations in conditions, and the necessity for detailed interpretations to ensure patient safety. Previous segmentation methods have sought to reduce image noise and enhance diagnostic performance, but these techniques require fine-grained, pixel-level ground truth masks for training. In contrast, with the rise of foundation models, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has been introduced to facilitate promptable segmentation, enabling the automation of the segmentation process with simple yet effective prompts. Efforts applying SAM predominantly focus on dermatoscopy images, which present more easily identifiable lesion boundaries than clinical photos taken with smartphones. This limitation constrains the practicality of these approaches to real-world applications. To overcome the challenges posed by noisy clinical photos acquired via non-standardized protocols and to improve diagnostic accessibility, we propose a novel Cross-Attentive Fusion framework for interpretable skin lesion diagnosis. Our method leverages SAM to generate visual concepts for skin diseases using prompts, integrating local visual concepts with global image features to enhance model performance. Extensive evaluation on two skin disease datasets demonstrates our proposed method's effectiveness on lesion diagnosis and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by WACV 2025</p></details> |

In contrast to traditional NAS methods, recently proposed one-shot NAS methods prove to be more efficient in performing NAS. One-shot NAS works by generating a singular weight-sharing supernetwork that acts as a search space (container) of subnetworks. Despite its achievements, designing the one-shot search space remains a major challenge. In this work we propose a search space design strategy for Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architectures. In particular, we convert the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a weight-sharing supernetwork called SuperSAM. Our approach involves automating the search space design via layer-wise structured pruning and parameter prioritization. While the structured pruning applies probabilistic removal of certain transformer layers, parameter prioritization performs weight reordering and slicing of MLP-blocks in the remaining layers. We train supernetworks on several datasets using the sandwich rule. For deployment, we enhance subnetwork discovery by utilizing a program autotuner to identify efficient subnetworks within the search space. The resulting subnetworks are 30-70% smaller in size compared to the original pre-trained SAM ViT-B, yet outperform the pretrained model. Our work introduces a new and effective method for ViT NAS search-space design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided SAM: Label-Efficient Part Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07434v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localizing object parts precisely is essential for tasks such as object recognition and robotic manipulation. Recent part segmentation methods require extensive training data and labor-intensive annotations. Segment-Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated good performance on a wide range of segmentation problems, but requires (manual) positional prompts to guide it where to segment. Furthermore, since it has been trained on full objects instead of object parts, it is prone to over-segmentation of parts. To address this, we propose a novel approach that guides SAM towards the relevant object parts. Our method learns positional prompts from coarse patch annotations that are easier and cheaper to acquire. We train classifiers on image patches to identify part classes and aggregate patches into regions of interest (ROIs) with positional prompts. SAM is conditioned on these ROIs and prompts. This approach, termed `Guided SAM', enhances efficiency and reduces manual effort, allowing effective part segmentation with minimal labeled data. We demonstrate the efficacy of Guided SAM on a dataset of car parts, improving the average IoU on state of the art models from 0.37 to 0.49 with annotations that are on average five times more efficient to acquire.</p></details> |  |

By significantly reducing annotation time, lowering technical barriers through its ease of deployment, and enhancing segmentation accuracy, SAM 2 addresses critical challenges faced by researchers and practitioners. Utilizing its zero-shot segmentation capabilities with minimal user input-a single click per video-we tested SAM 2 on over 14 million eye images from diverse datasets, including virtual reality setups and the world's largest unified dataset recorded using wearable eye trackers. Remarkably, in pupil segmentation tasks, SAM 2 matches the performance of domain-specific models trained solely on eye images, achieving competitive mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) scores of up to 93% without fine-tuning.

| **[Interactive 3D Medical Image Segmentation with SAM 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02635v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive medical image segmentation (IMIS) has shown significant potential in enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating iterative feedback from medical professionals. However, the limited availability of enough 3D medical data restricts the generalization and robustness of most IMIS methods. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), though effective for 2D images, requires expensive semi-auto slice-by-slice annotations for 3D medical images. In this paper, we explore the zero-shot capabilities of SAM 2, the next-generation Meta SAM model trained on videos, for 3D medical image segmentation. By treating sequential 2D slices of 3D images as video frames, SAM 2 can fully automatically propagate annotations from a single frame to the entire 3D volume. We propose a practical pipeline for using SAM 2 in 3D medical image segmentation and present key findings highlighting its efficiency and potential for further optimization. Concretely, numerical experiments on the BraTS2020 and the medical segmentation decathlon datasets demonstrate that SAM 2 still has a gap with supervised methods but can narrow the gap in specific settings and organ types, significantly reducing the annotation burden on medical professionals. Our code will be open-sourced and available at https://github.com/Chuyun-Shen/SAM_2_Medical_3D.</p></details> |  |
| **[Region-Guided Attack on the Segment Anything Model (SAM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02974v3)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a cornerstone of image segmentation, demonstrating exceptional performance across various applications, particularly in autonomous driving and medical imaging, where precise segmentation is crucial. However, SAM is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can significantly impair its functionality through minor input perturbations. Traditional techniques, such as FGSM and PGD, are often ineffective in segmentation tasks due to their reliance on global perturbations that overlook spatial nuances. Recent methods like Attack-SAM-K and UAD have begun to address these challenges, but they frequently depend on external cues and do not fully leverage the structural interdependencies within segmentation processes. This limitation underscores the need for a novel adversarial strategy that exploits the unique characteristics of segmentation tasks. In response, we introduce the Region-Guided Attack (RGA), designed specifically for SAM. RGA utilizes a Region-Guided Map (RGM) to manipulate segmented regions, enabling targeted perturbations that fragment large segments and expand smaller ones, resulting in erroneous outputs from SAM. Our experiments demonstrate that RGA achieves high success rates in both white-box and black-box scenarios, emphasizing the need for robust defenses against such sophisticated attacks. RGA not only reveals SAM's vulnerabilities but also lays the groundwork for developing more resilient defenses against adversarial threats in image segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foreground-Covering Prototype Generation and Matching for SAM-Aided Few-Shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00752v1)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Foreground-Covering Prototype Generation and Matching to resolve Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS), which aims to segment target regions in unlabeled query images based on labeled support images. Unlike previous research, which typically estimates target regions in the query using support prototypes and query pixels, we utilize the relationship between support and query prototypes. To achieve this, we utilize two complementary features: SAM Image Encoder features for pixel aggregation and ResNet features for class consistency. Specifically, we construct support and query prototypes with SAM features and distinguish query prototypes of target regions based on ResNet features. For the query prototype construction, we begin by roughly guiding foreground regions within SAM features using the conventional pseudo-mask, then employ iterative cross-attention to aggregate foreground features into learnable tokens. Here, we discover that the cross-attention weights can effectively alternate the conventional pseudo-mask. Therefore, we use the attention-based pseudo-mask to guide ResNet features to focus on the foreground, then infuse the guided ResNet feature into the learnable tokens to generate class-consistent query prototypes. The generation of the support prototype is conducted symmetrically to that of the query one, with the pseudo-mask replaced by the ground-truth mask. Finally, we compare these query prototypes with support ones to generate prompts, which subsequently produce object masks through the SAM Mask Decoder. Our state-of-the-art performances on various datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for FSS.

| **[Advanced Lung Nodule Segmentation and Classification for Early Detection of Lung Cancer using SAM and Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00586v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lung cancer is an extremely lethal disease primarily due to its late-stage diagnosis and significant mortality rate, making it the major cause of cancer-related demises globally. Machine Learning (ML) and Convolution Neural network (CNN) based Deep Learning (DL) techniques are primarily used for precise segmentation and classification of cancerous nodules in the CT (Computed Tomography) or MRI images. This study introduces an innovative approach to lung nodule segmentation by utilizing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) combined with transfer learning techniques. Precise segmentation of lung nodules is crucial for the early detection of lung cancer. The proposed method leverages Bounding Box prompts and a vision transformer model to enhance segmentation performance, achieving high accuracy, Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics. The integration of SAM and Transfer Learning significantly improves Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems in medical imaging, particularly for lung cancer diagnosis. The findings demonstrate the proposed model effectiveness in precisely segmenting lung nodules from CT scans, underscoring its potential to advance early detection and improve patient care outcomes in lung cancer diagnosis. The results show SAM Model with transfer learning achieving a DSC of 97.08% and an IoU of 95.6%, for segmentation and accuracy of 96.71% for classification indicates that ,its performance is noteworthy compared to existing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAM-Aware Graph Prompt Reasoning Network for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00303v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary challenge of cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is the domain disparity between the training and inference phases, which can exist in either the input data or the target classes. Previous models struggle to learn feature representations that generalize to various unknown domains from limited training domain samples. In contrast, the large-scale visual model SAM, pre-trained on tens of millions of images from various domains and classes, possesses excellent generalizability. In this work, we propose a SAM-aware graph prompt reasoning network (GPRN) that fully leverages SAM to guide CD-FSS feature representation learning and improve prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose a SAM-aware prompt initialization module (SPI) to transform the masks generated by SAM into visual prompts enriched with high-level semantic information. Since SAM tends to divide an object into many sub-regions, this may lead to visual prompts representing the same semantic object having inconsistent or fragmented features. We further propose a graph prompt reasoning (GPR) module that constructs a graph among visual prompts to reason about their interrelationships and enable each visual prompt to aggregate information from similar prompts, thus achieving global semantic consistency. Subsequently, each visual prompt embeds its semantic information into the corresponding mask region to assist in feature representation learning. To refine the segmentation mask during testing, we also design a non-parameter adaptive point selection module (APS) to select representative point prompts from query predictions and feed them back to SAM to refine inaccurate segmentation results. Experiments on four standard CD-FSS datasets demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art results. Code: https://github.com/CVL-hub/GPRN.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Promptable Anomaly Segmentation with SAM Through Self-Perception Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17217v4)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Model (SAM) has made great progress in anomaly segmentation tasks due to its impressive generalization ability. However, existing methods that directly apply SAM through prompting often overlook the domain shift issue, where SAM performs well on natural images but struggles in industrial scenarios. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) offers a promising solution, but it may yield suboptimal performance by not adequately addressing the perception challenges during adaptation to anomaly images. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{P}erceptinon \textbf{T}uning (\textbf{SPT}) method, aiming to enhance SAM's perception capability for anomaly segmentation. The SPT method incorporates a self-drafting tuning strategy, which generates an initial coarse draft of the anomaly mask, followed by a refinement process. Additionally, a visual-relation-aware adapter is introduced to improve the perception of discriminative relational information for mask generation. Extensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPT method can significantly outperform baseline methods, validating its effectiveness.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI-25 |
| **[SSE-SAM: Balancing Head and Tail Classes Gradually through Stage-Wise SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13715v2)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world datasets often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, where vast majority of classes known as tail classes have only few samples. Traditional methods tend to overfit on these tail classes. Recently, a new approach called Imbalanced SAM (ImbSAM) is proposed to leverage the generalization benefits of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) for long-tailed distributions. The main strategy is to merely enhance the smoothness of the loss function for tail classes. However, we argue that improving generalization in long-tail scenarios requires a careful balance between head and tail classes. We show that neither SAM nor ImbSAM alone can fully achieve this balance. For SAM, we prove that although it enhances the model's generalization ability by escaping saddle point in the overall loss landscape, it does not effectively address this for tail-class losses. Conversely, while ImbSAM is more effective at avoiding saddle points in tail classes, the head classes are trained insufficiently, resulting in significant performance drops. Based on these insights, we propose Stage-wise Saddle Escaping SAM (SSE-SAM), which uses complementary strengths of ImbSAM and SAM in a phased approach. Initially, SSE-SAM follows the majority sample to avoid saddle points of the head-class loss. During the later phase, it focuses on tail-classes to help them escape saddle points. Our experiments confirm that SSE-SAM has better ability in escaping saddles both on head and tail classes, and shows performance improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update: Add missing information and correct some grammatical issues</p></details> |

Addressing this performance gap is important to fully leverage the pre-trained weights of SAMs, particularly in the domain of volumetric medical image segmentation, where accuracy is important but well-annotated 3D medical data for fine-tuning is limited. In this work, we investigate whether introducing the memory mechanism as a plug-in, specifically the ability to memorize and recall internal representations of past inputs, can improve the performance of SAM with limited computation cost. To this end, we propose Memorizing SAM, a novel 3D SAM architecture incorporating a memory Transformer as a plug-in. Unlike conventional memorizing Transformers that save the internal representation during training or inference, our Memorizing SAM utilizes existing highly accurate internal representation as the memory source to ensure the quality of memory. We evaluate the performance of Memorizing SAM in 33 categories from the TotalSegmentator dataset, which indicates that Memorizing SAM can outperform state-of-the-art 3D SAM variant i.e., FastSAM3D with an average Dice increase of 11.36% at the cost of only 4.38 millisecond increase in inference time.

| **[Learnable Prompting SAM-induced Knowledge Distillation for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13742v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The limited availability of labeled data has driven advancements in semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation. Modern large-scale models tailored for general segmentation, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have revealed robust generalization capabilities. However, applying these models directly to medical image segmentation still exposes performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a learnable prompting SAM-induced Knowledge distillation framework (KnowSAM) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Firstly, we propose a Multi-view Co-training (MC) strategy that employs two distinct sub-networks to employ a co-teaching paradigm, resulting in more robust outcomes. Secondly, we present a Learnable Prompt Strategy (LPS) to dynamically produce dense prompts and integrate an adapter to fine-tune SAM specifically for medical image segmentation tasks. Moreover, we propose SAM-induced Knowledge Distillation (SKD) to transfer useful knowledge from SAM to two sub-networks, enabling them to learn from SAM's predictions and alleviate the effects of incorrect pseudo-labels during training. Notably, the predictions generated by our subnets are used to produce mask prompts for SAM, facilitating effective inter-module information exchange. Extensive experimental results on various medical segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation approaches. Crucially, our SAM distillation framework can be seamlessly integrated into other semi-supervised segmentation methods to enhance performance. The code will be released upon acceptance of this manuscript at: https://github.com/taozh2017/KnowSAM</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[SEG-SAM: Semantic-Guided SAM for Unified Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12660v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, developing unified medical image segmentation models gains increasing attention, especially with the advent of the Segment Anything Model (SAM). SAM has shown promising binary segmentation performance in natural domains, however, transferring it to the medical domain remains challenging, as medical images often possess substantial inter-category overlaps. To address this, we propose the SEmantic-Guided SAM (SEG-SAM), a unified medical segmentation model that incorporates semantic medical knowledge to enhance medical segmentation performance. First, to avoid the potential conflict between binary and semantic predictions, we introduce a semantic-aware decoder independent of SAM's original decoder, specialized for both semantic segmentation on the prompted object and classification on unprompted objects in images. To further enhance the model's semantic understanding, we solicit key characteristics of medical categories from large language models and incorporate them into SEG-SAM through a text-to-vision semantic module, adaptively transferring the language information into the visual segmentation task. In the end, we introduce the cross-mask spatial alignment strategy to encourage greater overlap between the predicted masks from SEG-SAM's two decoders, thereby benefiting both predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEG-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art SAM-based methods in unified binary medical segmentation and task-specific methods in semantic medical segmentation, showcasing promising results and potential for broader medical applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

Retrieval-based SD methods, one kind of model-free method, have yielded promising speedup, but they often rely on incomplete retrieval resources, inefficient retrieval methods, and are constrained to certain domains. This paper presents a novel retrieval-based speculative decoding method that adapts suffix automaton (SAM) for efficient and accurate draft generation by utilizing common text corpus and dynamic text sequence. Unlike existing $n$-gram matching methods, SAM-Decoding finds the exact longest suffix match, achieving an average time complexity of O(1) per generation step of SAM update and suffix retrieval. It can also integrate with existing methods, adaptively selecting a draft generation strategy based on match length to generalize to broader domains. Extensive experiments on Spec-Bench show that our method is $18\%+$ faster than other retrieval-based SD methods. Additionally, when combined with advanced EAGLE-2, it provides an additional speedup of $3.28\%$ -- $11.13\%$ across various-sized LLM backbones.

XCT commonly accompanied by advanced image analysis and computer vision algorithms to extract relevant information from the images. Traditional computer vision models often struggle due to noise, resolution variability, and complex internal structures, particularly in scientific imaging applications. State-of-the-art foundational models, like the Segment Anything Model (SAM)-designed for general-purpose image segmentation-have revolutionized image segmentation across various domains, yet their application in specialized fields like materials science remains under-explored. In this work, we explore the application and limitations of SAM for industrial X-ray CT inspection of additive manufacturing components. We demonstrate that while SAM shows promise, it struggles with out-of-distribution data, multiclass segmentation, and computational efficiency during fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose a fine-tuning strategy utilizing parameter-efficient techniques, specifically Conv-LoRa, to adapt SAM for material-specific datasets. Additionally, we leverage generative adversarial network (GAN)-generated data to enhance the training process and improve the model's segmentation performance on complex X-ray CT data. Our experimental results highlight the importance of tailored segmentation models for accurate inspection, showing that fine-tuning SAM on domain-specific scientific imaging data significantly improves performance. However, despite improvements, the model's ability to generalize across diverse datasets remains limited, highlighting the need for further research into robust, scalable solutions for domain-specific segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Baltimore Atlas: FreqWeaver Adapter for Semi-supervised Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15565v2)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-high Spatial Resolution (UHSR) Land Cover Classification is increasingly important for urban analysis, enabling fine-scale planning, ecological monitoring, and infrastructure management. It identifies land cover types on sub-meter remote sensing imagery, capturing details such as building outlines, road networks, and distinct boundaries. However, most existing methods focus on 1 m imagery and rely heavily on large-scale annotations, while UHSR data remain scarce and difficult to annotate, limiting practical applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce Baltimore Atlas, a UHSR land cover classification framework that reduces reliance on large-scale training data and delivers high-accuracy results. Baltimore Atlas builds on three key ideas: (1) Baltimore Atlas Dataset, a 0.3 m resolution dataset based on aerial imagery of Baltimore City; (2) FreqWeaver Adapter, a parameter-efficient adapter that transfers SAM2 to this domain, leveraging foundation model knowledge to reduce training data needs while enabling fine-grained detail and structural modeling; (3) Uncertainty-Aware Teacher Student Framework, a semi-supervised framework that exploits unlabeled data to further reduce training dependence and improve generalization across diverse scenes. Using only 5.96% of total model parameters, our approach achieves a 1.78% IoU improvement over existing parameter-efficient tuning strategies and a 3.44% IoU gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution remote sensing segmentation methods on the Baltimore Atlas Dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViRefSAM: Visual Reference-Guided Segment Anything Model for Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02294v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically, ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features, enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$, LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[RS-MTDF: Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion for Remote Sensing Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08772v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation in remote sensing images is crucial for various applications, yet its performance is heavily reliant on large-scale, high-quality pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS methods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization. To alleviate this issue, we attempt to introduce the Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) pre-trained on vast and diverse datasets into the SSS task since VFMs possess robust generalization capabilities that can effectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for SSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge embedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing. Specifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (e.g., DINOv2 and CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student features with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative power, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder. Extensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing approaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in the majority of semantic categories. These results underscore the efficacy of multi-teacher VFM guidance in significantly enhancing both generalization and semantic understanding for remote sensing segmentation. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each proposed module.</p></details> |  |
| **[F2Net: A Frequency-Fused Network for Ultra-High Resolution Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07847v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery is critical for applications like environmental monitoring and urban planning but faces computational and optimization challenges. Conventional methods either lose fine details through downsampling or fragment global context via patch processing. While multi-branch networks address this trade-off, they suffer from computational inefficiency and conflicting gradient dynamics during training. We propose F2Net, a frequency-aware framework that decomposes UHR images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing. The high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution structural details, while the low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs through dual sub-branches capturing short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module integrates these observations, guided by two novel objectives: Cross-Frequency Alignment Loss ensures semantic consistency between frequency components, and Cross-Frequency Balance Loss regulates gradient magnitudes across branches to stabilize training. Evaluated on DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial benchmarks, F2Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 and 83.39, respectively. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate the extent to which urban sounds correspond with visual scenes by comparing various visual representation strategies in capturing acoustic semantics. We employ a multimodal approach that integrates geo-referenced sound recordings with both street-level and remote sensing imagery across three major global cities: London, New York, and Tokyo. Utilizing the AST model for audio, along with CLIP and RemoteCLIP for imagery, as well as CLIPSeg and Seg-Earth OV for semantic segmentation, we extract embeddings and class-level features to evaluate cross-modal similarity. The results indicate that street view embeddings demonstrate stronger alignment with environmental sounds compared to segmentation outputs, whereas remote sensing segmentation is more effective in interpreting ecological categories through a Biophony--Geophony--Anthrophony (BGA) framework. These findings imply that embedding-based models offer superior semantic alignment, while segmentation-based methods provide interpretable links between visual structure and acoustic ecology. This work advances the burgeoning field of multimodal urban sensing by offering novel perspectives for incorporating sound into geospatial analysis.</p></details> |  |

Open-vocabulary image Segmentation addresses these generalization issues in traditional supervised segmentation models while reducing reliance on extensive per-pixel annotations, which are both expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. Most Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) methods are designed for natural images but struggle with remote sensing data due to scale variations, orientation changes, and complex scene compositions. This necessitates the development of OVS approaches specifically tailored for remote sensing. In this context, we propose AerOSeg, a novel OVS approach for remote sensing data. First, we compute robust image-text correlation features using multiple rotated versions of the input image and domain-specific prompts. These features are then refined through spatial and class refinement blocks. Inspired by the success of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in diverse domains, we leverage SAM features to guide the spatial refinement of correlation features. Additionally, we introduce a semantic back-projection module and loss to ensure the seamless propagation of SAM's semantic information throughout the segmentation pipeline. Finally, we enhance the refined correlation features using a multi-scale attention-aware decoder to produce the final segmentation map. We validate our SAM-guided Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Segmentation model on three benchmark remote sensing datasets: iSAID, DLRSD, and OpenEarthMap. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.54 h-mIoU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EarthVision workshop, CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Center-guided Classifier for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16963v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared with natural images, remote sensing images (RSIs) have the unique characteristic. i.e., larger intraclass variance, which makes semantic segmentation for remote sensing images more challenging. Moreover, existing semantic segmentation models for remote sensing images usually employ a vanilla softmax classifier, which has three drawbacks: (1) non-direct supervision for the pixel representations during training; (2) inadequate modeling ability of parametric softmax classifiers under large intraclass variance; and (3) opaque process of classification decision. In this paper, we propose a novel classifier (called CenterSeg) customized for RSI semantic segmentation, which solves the abovementioned problems with multiple prototypes, direct supervision under Grassmann manifold, and interpretability strategy. Specifically, for each class, our CenterSeg obtains local class centers by aggregating corresponding pixel features based on ground-truth masks, and generates multiple prototypes through hard attention assignment and momentum updating. In addition, we introduce the Grassmann manifold and constrain the joint embedding space of pixel features and prototypes based on two additional regularization terms. Especially, during the inference, CenterSeg can further provide interpretability to the model by restricting the prototype as a sample of the training set. Experimental results on three remote sensing segmentation datasets validate the effectiveness of the model. Besides the superior performance, CenterSeg has the advantages of simplicity, lightweight, compatibility, and interpretability.

| **[SAM2-ELNet: Label Enhancement and Automatic Annotation for Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12404v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image segmentation is crucial for environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and resource management, directly affecting the accuracy and efficiency of surface information extraction. The performance of existing supervised models in remote sensing image segmentation tasks highly depends on the quality of label data. However, current label data mainly relies on manual annotation, which comes with high time costs and is subject to subjective interference, resulting in distortion of label boundaries and often a loss of detail. To solve the above problems, our work proposes an Edge-enhanced Labeling Network, called SAM2-ELNet, which incorporates a labeling module and an edge attention mechanism. This model effectively addresses issues such as label detail loss, fragmentation, and inaccurate boundaries. Due to the scarcity of manually annotated remote sensing data, the feature extraction capabilities of traditional neural networks are limited. Our method uses the Hiera backbone of the pre-trained self-supervised large model segment anything model 2 (SAM2) as the encoder, achieves high-quality and efficient feature extraction even with small samples by fine-tuning on downstream tasks. This study compared the training effects of original and enhanced labels on the manually annotated Deep-SAR Oil Spill (SOS) dataset. Results showed that the model trained with enhanced labels performed better and had a lower final loss, indicating closer alignment with the real data distribution. Our work also explores the potential of extending the model into an efficient automatic annotation framework through generalization experiments, facilitating large-scale remote sensing image interpretation and intelligent recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detect Changes like Humans: Incorporating Semantic Priors for Improved Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16918v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When given two similar images, humans identify their differences by comparing the appearance ({\it e.g., color, texture}) with the help of semantics ({\it e.g., objects, relations}). However, mainstream change detection models adopt a supervised training paradigm, where the annotated binary change map is the main constraint. Thus, these methods primarily emphasize the difference-aware features between bi-temporal images and neglect the semantic understanding of the changed landscapes, which undermines the accuracy in the presence of noise and illumination variations. To this end, this paper explores incorporating semantic priors to improve the ability to detect changes. Firstly, we propose a Semantic-Aware Change Detection network, namely SA-CDNet, which transfers the common knowledge of the visual foundation models ({\it i.e., FastSAM}) to change detection. Inspired by the human visual paradigm, a novel dual-stream feature decoder is derived to distinguish changes by combining semantic-aware features and difference-aware features. Secondly, we design a single-temporal semantic pre-training strategy to enhance the semantic understanding of landscapes, which brings further increments. Specifically, we construct pseudo-change detection data from public single-temporal remote sensing segmentation datasets for large-scale pre-training, where an extra branch is also introduced for the proxy semantic segmentation task. Experimental results on five challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over the existing state-of-the-art methods.

This task presents two principal challenges: (1) severe inconsistencies in feature representation across different remote sensing domains, and (2) a domain gap that emerges due to the representation bias of source domain patterns when translating features to predictive logits. To tackle these issues, we propose a joint-optimized adversarial network incorporating the "Segment Anything Model (SAM) (SAM-JOANet)" for UDA-RSSeg. Our approach integrates SAM to leverage its robust generalized representation capabilities, thereby alleviating feature inconsistencies. We introduce a finetuning decoder designed to convert SAM-Encoder features into predictive logits. Additionally, a feature-level adversarial-based prompted segmentor is employed to generate class-agnostic maps, which guide the finetuning decoder's feature representations. The network is optimized end-to-end, combining the prompted segmentor and the finetuning decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including ISPRS (Potsdam/Vaihingen) and CITY-OSM (Paris/Chicago), demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The results, supported by visualization and analysis, confirm the method's interpretability and robustness.

| **[Graph Information Bottleneck for Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02545v2)** | 2024-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing segmentation has a wide range of applications in environmental protection, and urban change detection, etc. Despite the success of deep learning-based remote sensing segmentation methods (e.g., CNN and Transformer), they are not flexible enough to model irregular objects. In addition, existing graph contrastive learning methods usually adopt the way of maximizing mutual information to keep the node representations consistent between different graph views, which may cause the model to learn task-independent redundant information. To tackle the above problems, this paper treats images as graph structures and introduces a simple contrastive vision GNN (SC-ViG) architecture for remote sensing segmentation. Specifically, we construct a node-masked and edge-masked graph view to obtain an optimal graph structure representation, which can adaptively learn whether to mask nodes and edges. Furthermore, this paper innovatively introduces information bottleneck theory into graph contrastive learning to maximize task-related information while minimizing task-independent redundant information. Finally, we replace the convolutional module in UNet with the SC-ViG module to complete the segmentation and classification tasks of remote sensing images. Extensive experiments on publicly available real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art remote sensing image segmentation methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Hi-ResNet: Edge Detail Enhancement for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12691v3)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution remote sensing (HRS) semantic segmentation extracts key objects from high-resolution coverage areas. However, objects of the same category within HRS images generally show significant differences in scale and shape across diverse geographical environments, making it difficult to fit the data distribution. Additionally, a complex background environment causes similar appearances of objects of different categories, which precipitates a substantial number of objects into misclassification as background. These issues make existing learning algorithms sub-optimal. In this work, we solve the above-mentioned problems by proposing a High-resolution remote sensing network (Hi-ResNet) with efficient network structure designs, which consists of a funnel module, a multi-branch module with stacks of information aggregation (IA) blocks, and a feature refinement module, sequentially, and Class-agnostic Edge Aware (CEA) loss. Specifically, we propose a funnel module to downsample, which reduces the computational cost, and extract high-resolution semantic information from the initial input image. Secondly, we downsample the processed feature images into multi-resolution branches incrementally to capture image features at different scales and apply IA blocks, which capture key latent information by leveraging attention mechanisms, for effective feature aggregation, distinguishing image features of the same class with variant scales and shapes. Finally, our feature refinement module integrate the CEA loss function, which disambiguates inter-class objects with similar shapes and increases the data distribution distance for correct predictions. With effective pre-training strategies, we demonstrated the superiority of Hi-ResNet over state-of-the-art methods on three HRS segmentation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

To fill the gap, our work introduces an innovative auto-labeling framework named ALPS (Automatic Labeling for Pre-training in Segmentation), leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to predict precise pseudo-labels for RS images without necessitating prior annotations or additional prompts. The proposed pipeline significantly reduces the labor and resource demands traditionally associated with annotating RS datasets. By constructing two comprehensive pseudo-labeled RS datasets via ALPS for pre-training purposes, our approach enhances the performance of downstream tasks across various benchmarks, including iSAID and ISPRS Potsdam. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its ability to generalize well across multiple tasks even under the scarcity of extensively annotated datasets, offering a scalable solution to automatic segmentation and annotation challenges in the field. In addition, the proposed a pipeline is flexible and can be applied to medical image segmentation, remarkably boosting the performance. Note that ALPS utilizes pre-trained SAM to semi-automatically annotate RS images without additional manual annotations. Though every component in the pipeline has bee well explored, integrating clustering algorithms with SAM and novel pseudo-label alignment significantly enhances RS segmentation, as an off-the-shelf tool for pre-training data preparation.

Previous efforts are dedicated to mining segmentation-guiding visual cues from a constrained set of support samples. However, they still struggle to address the pronounced intra-class differences in RS images, as sparse visual cues make it challenging to establish robust class-specific representations. In this paper, we propose a holistic semantic embedding (HSE) approach that effectively harnesses general semantic knowledge, i.e., class description (CD) embeddings.Instead of the naive combination of CD embeddings and visual features for segmentation decoding, we investigate embedding the general semantic knowledge during the feature extraction stage.Specifically, in HSE, a spatial dense interaction module allows the interaction of visual support features with CD embeddings along the spatial dimension via self-attention.Furthermore, a global content modulation module efficiently augments the global information of the target category in both support and query features, thanks to the transformative fusion of visual features and CD embeddings.These two components holistically synergize general CD embeddings and visual cues, constructing a robust class-specific representation.Through extensive experiments on the standard FSS benchmark, the proposed HSE approach demonstrates superior performance compared to peer work, setting a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

This framework employs a two-stage network design: the first stage extracts features using spatial methods to obtain features with sufficient spatial details and semantic information; the second stage maps these features in both spatial and frequency domains. In the frequency domain mapping, we introduce the Wavelet Transform Feature Decomposer (WTFD) structure, which decomposes features into low-frequency and high-frequency components using the Haar wavelet transform and integrates them with spatial features. To bridge the semantic gap between frequency and spatial features, and facilitate significant feature selection to promote the combination of features from different representation domains, we design the Multiscale Dual-Representation Alignment Filter (MDAF). This structure utilizes multiscale convolutions and dual-cross attentions. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, SFFNet achieves superior performance in terms of mIoU, reaching 84.80% and 87.73% respectively.The code is located at https://github.com/yysdck/SFFNet.</p></details> |  |

Segmentation and extraction of specific targets are essential tasks when facing the vast and complex remote sensing images. Recently, the introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides a universal pre-training model for image segmentation tasks. While the direct application of SAM to remote sensing image segmentation tasks does not yield satisfactory results, we propose RSAM-Seg, which stands for Remote Sensing SAM with Semantic Segmentation, as a tailored modification of SAM for the remote sensing field and eliminates the need for manual intervention to provide prompts. Adapter-Scale, a set of supplementary scaling modules, are proposed in the multi-head attention blocks of the encoder part of SAM. Furthermore, Adapter-Feature are inserted between the Vision Transformer (ViT) blocks. These modules aim to incorporate high-frequency image information and image embedding features to generate image-informed prompts. Experiments are conducted on four distinct remote sensing scenarios, encompassing cloud detection, field monitoring, building detection and road mapping tasks . The experimental results not only showcase the improvement over the original SAM and U-Net across cloud, buildings, fields and roads scenarios, but also highlight the capacity of RSAM-Seg to discern absent areas within the ground truth of certain datasets, affirming its potential as an auxiliary annotation method. In addition, the performance in few-shot scenarios is commendable, underscores its potential in dealing with limited datasets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

There are two research gaps in the current research: 1) Most studies only focus on the relationship between design elements and pay little attention to the external information of the site; 2) GAN and other traditional generative algorithms generate results with low resolution and insufficient details. To address these two problems, we integrate GAN, Stable diffusion multimodal large-scale image pre-training model to construct a full-process park generative design method: 1) First, construct a high-precision remote sensing object extraction system for automated extraction of urban environmental information; 2) Secondly, use GAN to construct a park design generation system based on the external environment, which can quickly infer and generate design schemes from urban environmental information; 3) Finally, introduce Stable Diffusion to optimize the design plan, fill in details, and expand the resolution of the plan by 64 times. This method can achieve a fully unmanned design automation workflow. The research results show that: 1) The relationship between the inside and outside of the site will affect the algorithm generation results. 2) Compared with traditional GAN algorithms, Stable diffusion significantly improve the information richness of the generated results.</p></details> |  |

SAMRS totally possesses 105,090 images and 1,668,241 instances, surpassing existing high-resolution RS segmentation datasets in size by several orders of magnitude. It provides object category, location, and instance information that can be used for semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection, either individually or in combination.

To address this issue, this paper proposes an efficient Generative Adversarial Transfomer (GATrans) for achieving high-precision semantic segmentation while maintaining an extremely efficient size. The framework utilizes a Global Transformer Network (GTNet) as the generator, efficiently extracting multi-level features through residual connections. GTNet employs global transformer blocks with progressively linear computational complexity to reassign global features based on a learnable similarity function. To focus on object-level and pixel-level information, the GATrans optimizes the objective function by combining structural similarity losses. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on the Vaihingen dataset, achieving an average F1 score of 90.17% and an overall accuracy of 91.92%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Labeling of High Resolution Images Using EfficientUNets and Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09731v2)** | 2022-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation necessitates approaches that learn high-level characteristics while dealing with enormous amounts of data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn unique and adaptive features to achieve this aim. However, due to the large size and high spatial resolution of remote sensing images, these networks cannot analyze an entire scene efficiently. Recently, deep transformers have proven their capability to record global interactions between different objects in the image. In this paper, we propose a new segmentation model that combines convolutional neural networks with transformers, and show that this mixture of local and global feature extraction techniques provides significant advantages in remote sensing segmentation. In addition, the proposed model includes two fusion layers that are designed to represent multi-modal inputs and output of the network efficiently. The input fusion layer extracts feature maps summarizing the relationship between image content and elevation maps (DSM). The output fusion layer uses a novel multi-task segmentation strategy where class labels are identified using class-specific feature extraction layers and loss functions. Finally, a fast-marching method is used to convert all unidentified class labels to their closest known neighbors. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methodology improves segmentation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

These methods are especially valuable for remote sensing tasks where producing labeled ground truth datasets can be prohibitively expensive but there is easy access to a wealth of unlabeled imagery. We perform a rigorous evaluation of SimCLR, a self-supervised method, and FixMatch, a semi-supervised method, on three remote sensing tasks: riverbed segmentation, land cover mapping, and flood mapping. We quantify performance improvements on these remote sensing segmentation tasks when additional imagery outside of the original supervised dataset is made available for training. We also design experiments to test the effectiveness of these techniques when the test set is domain shifted to sample different geographic areas compared to the training and validation sets. We find that such techniques significantly improve generalization performance when labeled data is limited and there are geographic domain shifts between the training data and the validation/test data.</p></details> |  |

However, existing RS VQA datasets are constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain. RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1 then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises 13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs), demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Multimedia Conference (ACM Multimedia 2025)</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and (3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large language model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal large language models and remote sensing vision-language models.

A key challenge lies in the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several works introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs. However, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the quality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data, while only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for generating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using Rule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs generation methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from multiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset, including about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two VLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an image-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP and RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only 4.2\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches across benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or even exceed manual annotations.

In this work, we focus on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), a Vision-Language foundation model that achieves high accuracy across various image classification tasks and often rivals fully supervised baselines, despite not being explicitly trained for those tasks. Nevertheless, there are still domains where zero-shot CLIP performance is far from optimal, such as Remote Sensing (RS) and medical imagery. These domains do not only exhibit fundamentally different distributions compared to natural images, but also commonly rely on complementary modalities, beyond RGB, to derive meaningful insights. To this end, we propose a methodology to align distinct RS image modalities with the visual and textual modalities of CLIP. Our two-stage procedure addresses the aforementioned distribution shift, extends the zero-shot capabilities of CLIP and enriches CLIP's shared embedding space with domain-specific knowledge. Initially, we robustly fine-tune CLIP according to the PAINT (Ilharco et al., 2022) patching protocol, in order to deal with the distribution shift. Building upon this foundation, we facilitate the cross-modal alignment of a RS modality encoder by distilling knowledge from the CLIP visual and textual encoders. We empirically show that both patching and cross-modal alignment translate to significant performance gains, across several RS imagery classification and cross-modal retrieval benchmark datasets. Notably, these enhancements are achieved without the reliance on textual descriptions, without introducing any task-specific parameters, without training from scratch and without catastrophic forgetting.

These models combine various data modalities, such as optical, radar, and LiDAR imagery, with textual and geographic information, enabling more comprehensive analysis and understanding of remote sensing data. The integration of multiple modalities allows for improved performance in tasks like object detection, land cover classification, and change detection, which are often challenged by the complex and heterogeneous nature of remote sensing data. However, despite these advancements, several challenges remain. The diversity in data types, the need for large-scale annotated datasets, and the complexity of multimodal fusion techniques pose significant obstacles to the effective deployment of these models. Moreover, the computational demands of training and fine-tuning multimodal models require significant resources, further complicating their practical application in remote sensing image interpretation tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in vision and multimodal foundation models for remote sensing, focusing on their architecture, training methods, datasets and application scenarios. We discuss the key challenges these models face, such as data alignment, cross-modal transfer learning, and scalability, while also identifying emerging research directions aimed at overcoming these limitations.

While performing well in multi-modal reasoning and multi-turn conversations, the existing models lack pixel-level understanding and struggle with multi-image inputs. In this work, we propose RSUniVLM, a unified, end-to-end RS VLM designed for comprehensive vision understanding across multiple granularity, including image-level, region-level, and pixel-level tasks. RSUniVLM also performs effectively in multi-image analysis, with instances of change detection and change captioning. To enhance the model's ability to capture visual information at different levels without increasing model size, we design a novel architecture called Granularity-oriented Mixture of Experts to constraint the model to about 1 billion parameters. We also construct a large-scale RS instruction-following dataset based on a variety of existing datasets in both RS and general domain, encompassing various tasks such as object localization, visual question answering, and semantic segmentation.

However, existing remote sensing vision language models (RSVLMs) often fall short in capturing the complex characteristics of remote sensing scenes, as they typically rely on low resolution, single scale visual features and simplistic methods to map visual features to language features. In this paper, we present Aquila, an advanced visual language foundation model designed to enable richer visual feature representation and more precise visual-language feature alignment for remote sensing images. Our approach introduces a learnable Hierarchical Spatial Feature Integration (SFI) module that supports high resolution image inputs and aggregates multi scale visual features, allowing for the detailed representation of complex visual information. Additionally, the SFI module is repeatedly integrated into the layers of the large language model (LLM) to achieve deep visual language feature alignment, without compromising the model's performance in natural language processing tasks. These innovations, capturing detailed visual effects through higher resolution and multi scale input, and enhancing feature alignment significantly improve the model's ability to learn from image text data. We validate the effectiveness of Aquila through extensive quantitative experiments and qualitative analyses, demonstrating its superior performance.</p></details> |  |

In the realm of remote sensing (RS), there is a growing interest in developing large vision language models (VLMs) specifically tailored for data analysis in this domain. However, current research predominantly revolves around visual recognition tasks, lacking comprehensive, large-scale image-text datasets that are aligned and suitable for training large VLMs, which poses significant challenges to effectively training such models for RS applications. In computer vision, recent research has demonstrated that fine-tuning large vision language models on small-scale, high-quality datasets can yield impressive performance in visual and language understanding. These results are comparable to state-of-the-art VLMs trained from scratch on massive amounts of data, such as GPT-4. Inspired by this captivating idea, in this work, we build a high-quality Remote Sensing Image Captioning dataset (RSICap) that facilitates the development of large VLMs in the RS field. Unlike previous RS datasets that either employ model-generated captions or short descriptions, RSICap comprises 2,585 human-annotated captions with rich and high-quality information. This dataset offers detailed descriptions for each image, encompassing scene descriptions (e.g., residential area, airport, or farmland) as well as object information (e.g., color, shape, quantity, absolute position, etc). To facilitate the evaluation of VLMs in the field of RS, we also provide a benchmark evaluation dataset called RSIEval. This dataset consists of human-annotated captions and visual question-answer pairs, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of VLMs in the context of RS.</p></details> |  |

This work addresses Incremental Test Time Adaptation of Vision Language Models, tackling scenarios where unseen classes and unseen domains continuously appear during testing. Unlike traditional Test Time Adaptation approaches, where the test stream comes only from a predefined set of classes, our framework allows models to adapt simultaneously to both covariate and label shifts, actively incorporating new classes as they emerge. Towards this goal, we establish a new benchmark for ITTA, integrating single image TTA methods for VLMs with active labeling techniques that query an oracle for samples potentially representing unseen classes during test time. We propose a segmentation assisted active labeling module, termed SegAssist, which is training free and repurposes the segmentation capabilities of VLMs to refine active sample selection, prioritizing samples likely to belong to unseen classes. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the potential of SegAssist to enhance the performance of VLMs in real world scenarios, where continuous adaptation to emerging data is essential.

Existing single-agent approaches, however, remain limited by structural constraints. Although multi-agent systems naturally decouple different competencies, recent progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has often been hindered by inefficiency and remains incompatible with current LVLM architectures. To address these challenges, we introduce SWIRL, a staged workflow for interleaved reinforcement learning designed for multi-agent systems. SWIRL reformulates MARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating one agent at a time while keeping the others fixed. This formulation enables stable training and promotes efficient coordination across agents. Theoretically, we provide a stepwise safety bound, a cross-round monotonic improvement theorem, and convergence guarantees on return, ensuring robust and principled optimization. In application to mobile GUI control, SWIRL instantiates a Navigator that converts language and screen context into structured plans, and an Interactor that grounds these plans into executable atomic actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on both high-level and low-level GUI benchmarks. Beyond GUI tasks, SWIRL also demonstrates strong capability in multi-agent mathematical reasoning, underscoring its potential as a general framework for developing efficient and robust multi-agent systems.</p></details> | 28 pages, 12 figures |

Recent works have proposed object-level hallucination scores to estimate the likelihood of object hallucination; however, these methods typically adopt either a global or local perspective in isolation, which may limit detection reliability. In this paper, we introduce GLSim, a novel training-free object hallucination detection framework that leverages complementary global and local embedding similarity signals between image and text modalities, enabling more accurate and reliable hallucination detection in diverse scenarios. We comprehensively benchmark existing object hallucination detection methods and demonstrate that GLSim achieves superior detection performance, outperforming competitive baselines by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing the Geolocation Capabilities, Limitations and Societal Risks of Generative Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19967v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geo-localization is the task of identifying the location of an image using visual cues alone. It has beneficial applications, such as improving disaster response, enhancing navigation, and geography education. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly demonstrating capabilities as accurate image geo-locators. This brings significant privacy risks, including those related to stalking and surveillance, considering the widespread uses of AI models and sharing of photos on social media. The precision of these models is likely to improve in the future. Despite these risks, there is little work on systematically evaluating the geolocation precision of Generative VLMs, their limits and potential for unintended inferences. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the geolocation capabilities of 25 state-of-the-art VLMs on four benchmark image datasets captured in diverse environments. Our results offer insight into the internal reasoning of VLMs and highlight their strengths, limitations, and potential societal risks. Our findings indicate that current VLMs perform poorly on generic street-level images yet achieve notably high accuracy (61\%) on images resembling social media content, raising significant and urgent privacy concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI Fall Symposium 2025 on AI Trustworthiness and Risk Assessment for Challenging Contexts (ATRACC)</p></details> |

To address this challenge, text-rich Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and benchmarks have emerged for high-resource languages like English. However, a critical gap persists for low-resource languages such as Korean, where the lack of comprehensive benchmarks hinders robust model evaluation and comparison. To bridge this gap, we introduce KRETA, a benchmark for Korean Reading and rEasoning in Text-rich VQA Attuned to diverse visual contexts. KRETA facilitates an in-depth evaluation of both visual text understanding and reasoning capabilities, while also supporting a multifaceted assessment across 15 domains and 26 image types. Additionally, we introduce a semi-automated VQA generation pipeline specifically optimized for text-rich settings, leveraging refined stepwise image decomposition and a rigorous seven-metric evaluation protocol to ensure data quality. While KRETA is tailored for Korean, we hope our adaptable and extensible pipeline will facilitate the development of similar benchmarks in other languages, thereby accelerating multilingual VLM research. The code and dataset for KRETA are available at https://github.com/tabtoyou/KRETA.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging a few examples as context, LLMs can perform both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Recent advancements in auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) built upon LLMs have showcased impressive performance in text-to-image generation. However, the potential of in-context learning for general image generation tasks remains largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce X-Prompt, a purely auto-regressive large-vision language model designed to deliver competitive performance across a wide range of both seen and unseen image generation tasks, all within a unified in-context learning framework. X-Prompt incorporates a specialized design that efficiently compresses valuable features from in-context examples, supporting longer in-context token sequences and improving its ability to generalize to unseen tasks. A unified training task for both text and image prediction enables X-Prompt to handle general image generation with enhanced task awareness from in-context examples. Extensive experiments validate the model's performance across diverse seen image generation tasks and its capacity to generalize to previously unseen tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/SunzeY/X-Prompt</p></details> |

However, these models suffer from object hallucination. This study revisits the previous claim that the cause of such hallucinations lies in the limited representational capacity of the vision encoder. Our analysis implies that the capacity of the vision encoder is not necessarily a major limiting factor in detecting object hallucination. Based on this insight, we propose Fine-grained CLIPScore (F-CLIPScore), a simple yet effective evaluation metric that enhances object-level granularity by incorporating text embeddings at the noun level. Evaluations on the OHD-Caps benchmark show that F-CLIPScore significantly outperforms conventional CLIPScore in accuracy by a large margin of \textbf{39.6\%} without additional training. We further demonstrate that F-CLIPScore-based data filtering reduces object hallucination in LVLM (4.9\% in POPE).</p></details> |  |
| **[NLKI: A lightweight Natural Language Knowledge Integration Framework for Improving Small VLMs in Commonsense VQA Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19724v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commonsense visual-question answering often hinges on knowledge that is missing from the image or the question. Small vision-language models (sVLMs) such as ViLT, VisualBERT and FLAVA therefore lag behind their larger generative counterparts. To study the effect of careful commonsense knowledge integration on sVLMs, we present an end-to-end framework (NLKI) that (i) retrieves natural language facts, (ii) prompts an LLM to craft natural language explanations, and (iii) feeds both signals to sVLMs respectively across two commonsense VQA datasets (CRIC, AOKVQA) and a visual-entailment dataset (e-SNLI-VE). Facts retrieved using a fine-tuned ColBERTv2 and an object information-enriched prompt yield explanations that largely cut down hallucinations, while lifting the end-to-end answer accuracy by up to 7% (across 3 datasets), making FLAVA and other models in NLKI match or exceed medium-sized VLMs such as Qwen-2 VL-2B and SmolVLM-2.5B. As these benchmarks contain 10-25% label noise, additional finetuning using noise-robust losses (such as symmetric cross entropy and generalised cross entropy) adds another 2.5% in CRIC, and 5.5% in AOKVQA. Our findings expose when LLM-based commonsense knowledge beats retrieval from commonsense knowledge bases, how noise-aware training stabilises small models in the context of external knowledge augmentation, and why parameter-efficient commonsense reasoning is now within reach for 250M models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explain Before You Answer: A Survey on Compositional Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17298v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness, interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception. Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges (e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration, human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of compositional visual reasoning research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/pokerme7777/Compositional-Visual-Reasoning-Survey</p></details> |

However, the current fully autonomous paradigm poses potential safety risks when model understanding or reasoning capabilities are insufficient. To address this challenge, we first introduce \textbf{InquireBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate mobile agents' capabilities in safe interaction and proactive inquiry with users, encompassing 5 categories and 22 sub-categories, where most existing VLM-based agents demonstrate near-zero performance. In this paper, we aim to develop an interactive system that actively seeks human confirmation at critical decision points. To achieve this, we propose \textbf{InquireMobile}, a novel model inspired by reinforcement learning, featuring a two-stage training strategy and an interactive pre-action reasoning mechanism. Finally, our model achieves an 46.8% improvement in inquiry success rate and the best overall success rate among existing baselines on InquireBench. We will open-source all datasets, models, and evaluation codes to facilitate development in both academia and industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-TPT: Improving Adversarial Robustness of Vision-Language Models through Test-Time Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11195v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have gained significant popularity as foundation models, with numerous fine-tuning methods developed to enhance performance on downstream tasks. However, due to their inherent vulnerability and the common practice of selecting from a limited set of open-source models, VLMs suffer from a higher risk of adversarial attacks than traditional vision models. Existing defense techniques typically rely on adversarial fine-tuning during training, which requires labeled data and lacks of flexibility for downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose robust test-time prompt tuning (R-TPT), which mitigates the impact of adversarial attacks during the inference stage. We first reformulate the classic marginal entropy objective by eliminating the term that introduces conflicts under adversarial conditions, retaining only the pointwise entropy minimization. Furthermore, we introduce a plug-and-play reliability-based weighted ensembling strategy, which aggregates useful information from reliable augmented views to strengthen the defense. R-TPT enhances defense against adversarial attacks without requiring labeled training data while offering high flexibility for inference tasks. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks with various attacks demonstrate the effectiveness of R-TPT. The code is available in https://github.com/TomSheng21/R-TPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (Corrected the results on the Aircraft dataset)</p></details> |
| **[Self-Rewarding Vision-Language Model via Reasoning Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19652v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from visual hallucinations, saying things that are not actually in the image, and language shortcuts, where they skip the visual part and just rely on text priors. These issues arise because most post-training methods for VLMs rely on simple verifiable answer matching and supervise only final outputs, leaving intermediate visual reasoning without explicit guidance. As a result, VLMs receive sparse visual signals and often learn to prioritize language-based reasoning over visual perception. To mitigate this, some existing methods add visual supervision using human annotations or distilled labels from external large models. However, human annotations are labor-intensive and costly, and because external signals cannot adapt to the evolving policy, they cause distributional shifts that can lead to reward hacking. In this paper, we introduce Vision-SR1, a self-rewarding method that improves visual reasoning without relying on external visual supervisions via reinforcement learning. Vision-SR1 decomposes VLM reasoning into two stages: visual perception and language reasoning. The model is first prompted to produce self-contained visual perceptions that are sufficient to answer the question without referring back the input image. To validate this self-containment, the same VLM model is then re-prompted to perform language reasoning using only the generated perception as input to compute reward. This self-reward is combined with supervision on final outputs, providing a balanced training signal that strengthens both visual perception and language reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that Vision-SR1 improves visual reasoning, mitigates visual hallucinations, and reduces reliance on language shortcuts across diverse vision-language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, two figures</p></details> |

Despite significant efforts to combat this issue due to the severe threat that fake news videos pose to public information security, existing methods still fall short in detection accuracy, often due to lack of knowledge to verify the news is real or not. However, large Vision Language Models (VLMs) have absorbed extensive real-world knowledge from massive multimodal datasets. Motivated by this, we adapt advanced VLMs for fake news detection in short videos. Upon close examination of news samples, we observe that short video samples can be categorized into four distinct scenarios: both video and text are real (for real samples), or both are fake, or either the video or text is fake (for fake samples). Inspired by this insight, we design four experts tailored to handle each scenario and integrate them into VLM via Mixture of Experts. Specifically, we develop the Progressive MoE Adapter (PMOE) module where detection experts first provide an initial analysis, followed by attribution experts for a comprehensive diagnosis, leading to a robust decision. Additionally, we also note the fake news videos often show inconsistency between two modalities. Consequently, we further design the Alignment-driven Event Checking (ADEC) module, which perceives the fake news by capturing the inconsistency between different modalities. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, FakeSV and FakeTT, verify the superiority of our model. It significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art models by +3.32% and +5.02%, establishing a new benchmark in the field.</p></details> | EMNLP2025 Findings |

Existing benchmarks tend to focus on perception or text-based comprehension, offering limited insight into how well these models perform on structured, logic-driven tasks that require both visual and linguistic reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce NPHardEval4V, a multimodal benchmark suite grounded in four classical NP-hard problems: Knapsack, Set Cover, Traveling Salesperson, and Vertex Cover. Each task is presented through a combination of structured visual layouts and textual prompts, designed to assess the ability of LVLMs to perform combinatorial reasoning under visual-linguistic constraints. We evaluate a set of advanced open-source and closed-source vision-language models under a unified prompting and problem representation framework. This enables fair comparison across models and task types, while isolating key variables affecting performance. Our results show that while these models perform reasonably well on perception-based inputs, they struggle with global optimization, abstraction, and constraint satisfaction. No single model demonstrates consistent reasoning capability across all problem types, and common failure patterns reveal fundamental limitations in current architectures. By leveraging the structure and complexity of NP-hard problems, NPHardEval4V provides a scalable, interpretable, and challenging testbed for diagnosing reasoning behaviors in LVLMs. We hope this benchmark can support the community in building more robust, inference-capable multimodal systems. The benchmark dataset and code are available at https://github.com/lizhouf/NPHardEval4.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Given the ubiquity and information richness of vision modality inputs in real-world scenarios, Cross-Vision tasks, encompassing Vision-Language Perception (VLP) and Image-to-Image (I2I), have attracted significant attention. Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and I2I Generation Models (GMs) are employed to handle VLP and I2I tasks, respectively. Previous research indicates that printing typographic words into input images significantly induces LVLMs and I2I GMs to produce disruptive outputs that are semantically aligned with those words. Additionally, visual prompts, as a more sophisticated form of typography, are also revealed to pose security risks to various applications of cross-vision tasks. However, the specific characteristics of the threats posed by visual prompts remain underexplored. In this paper, to comprehensively investigate the performance impact induced by Typographic Visual Prompt Injection (TVPI) in various LVLMs and I2I GMs, we propose the Typographic Visual Prompts Injection Dataset and thoroughly evaluate the TVPI security risks on various open-source and closed-source LVLMs and I2I GMs under visual prompts with different target semantics, deepening the understanding of TVPI threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by IJCAI2025 Workshop on Deepfake Detection, Localization, and Interpretability</p></details> |

However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover, these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy, we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less temporal redundancy.</p></details> |  |

However, these models struggle with compositional generalization and object binding, which limit their ability to handle novel combinations of objects and their attributes. Our work explores the root causes of these failures using mechanistic interpretability techniques. We show evidence that individual neurons in the MLP layers of CLIP's vision encoder represent multiple features, and this "superposition" directly hinders its compositional feature representation which consequently affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities. We hope this study will serve as an initial step toward uncovering the mechanistic roots of compositional failures in VLMs. The code and supporting results can be found https://github.com/Mystic-Slice/Do-VLMs-Have-Bad-Eyes.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Explainable Computer Vision: Quo Vadis? workshop at ICCV'25</p></details> |

Recent works leverage pre-trained vision-language models to measure the similarity between encoded visual observations and textual instructions, and then train a model to map this similarity to robot actions. However, this two-step approach limits the model to capture the relationship between visual observations and textual instructions, leading to reduced precision in manipulation tasks. We propose to learn visual-textual associations through a self-supervised pretext task: reconstructing a masked goal image conditioned on an input image and textual instructions. This formulation allows the model to learn visual-action representations without robot action supervision. The learned representations can then be fine-tuned for manipulation tasks with only a few demonstrations. We also introduce the \textit{Omni-Object Pick-and-Place} dataset, which consists of annotated robot tabletop manipulation episodes, including 180 object classes and 3,200 instances with corresponding textual instructions. This dataset enables the model to acquire diverse object priors and allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of its generalisation capability across object instances. Experimental results on the five benchmarks, including both simulated and real-robot validations, demonstrate that our method outperforms prior art.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore the use of a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM), based on LLaMA 3.2, for classifying neutrino interactions from pixelated detector images in high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark its performance against an established CNN baseline used in experiments like NOvA and DUNE, evaluating metrics such as classification accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. Our results show that the VLM not only matches or exceeds CNN performance but also enables richer reasoning and better integration of auxiliary textual or semantic context. These findings suggest that VLMs offer a promising general-purpose backbone for event classification in HEP, paving the way for multimodal approaches in experimental neutrino physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Route-and-Execute: Auditable Model-Card Matching and Specialty-Level Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16839v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical workflows are fragmented as a patchwork of scripts and task-specific networks that often handle triage, task selection, and model deployment. These pipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency and raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model identification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model outputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that uses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First (Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an incoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow (modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i) stagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a stagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each stage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow with clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on specialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream tasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying deployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology, our single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines. Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach shows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by data scientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection (with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[mRAG: Elucidating the Design Space of Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24073v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, visual grounding, and complex reasoning. However, they remain limited by static training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to verify claims against up-to-date, external evidence, compromising their performance in dynamic real-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical solution to mitigate these challenges by allowing the LVLMs to access large-scale knowledge databases via retrieval mechanisms, thereby grounding model outputs in factual, contextually relevant information. Here in this paper, we conduct the first systematic dissection of the multimodal RAG pipeline for LVLMs, explicitly investigating (1) the retrieval phase: on the modality configurations and retrieval strategies, (2) the re-ranking stage: on strategies to mitigate positional biases and improve the relevance of retrieved evidence, and (3) the generation phase: we further investigate how to best integrate retrieved candidates into the final generation process. Finally, we extend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking and generation through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidence and suppress irrelevant context dynamically. Our full-stack exploration of RAG for LVLMs yields substantial insights, resulting in an average performance boost of 5% without any fine-tuning.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Do LVLMs Know What They Know? A Systematic Study of Knowledge Boundary Perception in LVLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19111v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question answering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model should perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does not. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by evaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three LVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable perception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three confidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To enhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods. Additionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that jointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering performance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level compared to LLMs.</p></details> | EMNLP2025 Findings |

To address this gap, we introduce AT-CXR, an uncertainty-aware agent for chest X-rays. The system estimates per-case confidence and distributional fit, then follows a stepwise policy to issue an automated decision or abstain with a suggested label for human intervention. We evaluate two router designs that share the same inputs and actions: a deterministic rule-based router and an LLM-decided router. Across five-fold evaluation on a balanced subset of NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, both variants outperform strong zero-shot vision-language models and state-of-the-art supervised classifiers, achieving higher full-coverage accuracy and superior selective-prediction performance, evidenced by a lower area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) and a lower error rate at high coverage, while operating with lower latency that meets practical clinical constraints. The two routers provide complementary operating points, enabling deployments to prioritize maximal throughput or maximal accuracy.

| **[Architecting Clinical Collaboration: Multi-Agent Reasoning Systems for Multimodal Medical VQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05520v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dermatological care via telemedicine often lacks the rich context of in-person visits. Clinicians must make diagnoses based on a handful of images and brief descriptions, without the benefit of physical exams, second opinions, or reference materials. While many medical AI systems attempt to bridge these gaps with domain-specific fine-tuning, this work hypothesized that mimicking clinical reasoning processes could offer a more effective path forward. This study tested seven vision-language models on medical visual question answering across six configurations: baseline models, fine-tuned variants, and both augmented with either reasoning layers that combine multiple model perspectives, analogous to peer consultation, or retrieval-augmented generation that incorporates medical literature at inference time, serving a role similar to reference-checking. While fine-tuning degraded performance in four of seven models with an average 30% decrease, baseline models collapsed on test data. Clinical-inspired architectures, meanwhile, achieved up to 70% accuracy, maintaining performance on unseen data while generating explainable, literature-grounded outputs critical for clinical adoption. These findings demonstrate that medical AI succeeds by reconstructing the collaborative and evidence-based practices fundamental to clinical diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events, ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels, and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous models by significant margins.

We introduce GRAS, a benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age, and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Document VQA Models via Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18984v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants - text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR - across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the "concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring its practical value for real-world Document VQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Workshop on Machine Learning in Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR WML 2025), Wuhan, China</p></details> |

MMCRICBENCH-3K comprises 1,463 synthetically generated scorecard images from ODI, T20, and Test formats, accompanied by 1,500 English QA pairs. It includes two subsets: MMCRICBENCH-E-1.5K, featuring English scorecards, and MMCRICBENCH-H-1.5K, containing visually similar Hindi scorecards, with all questions and answers kept in English to enable controlled cross-script evaluation. The task demands reasoning over structured numerical data, multi-image context, and implicit domain knowledge. Empirical results show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and exhibit a further drop in performance on the Hindi subset. This reveals key limitations in structure-aware visual text understanding, numerical reasoning, and cross-lingual generalization. The dataset is publicly available via Hugging Face at https://huggingface.co/datasets/DIALab/MMCricBench, to promote LVLM research in this direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prototype-Guided Diffusion: Visual Conditioning without External Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09922v4)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework for high-quality image generation, offering stable training and strong performance across diverse domains. However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly during the iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusion alleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, though at the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such as Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioning denoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. While effective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage and retrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP for similarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the Prototype Diffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directly into the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning - without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDM constructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image features using contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps by aligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns, enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments show that PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational and storage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-based conditioning in diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[M$^2$IV: Towards Efficient and Fine-grained Multimodal In-Context Learning via Representation Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04633v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) equips Large Vision-language Models (LVLMs) with the ability to adapt to new tasks via multiple user-provided demonstrations, without requiring any model parameter updates. However, its effectiveness is constrained by the token-intensive nature of multimodal inputs and the complexity of cross-modal few-shot reasoning, which together hinder LVLMs from extracting useful patterns from demonstrations. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{M$^2$IV}, a novel representation engineering approach that replaces explicit token-level demonstrations with a set of learnable Multimodal In-context Vectors directly injected into the residual streams of LVLMs. By analyzing the distinct roles of multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) in the ICL process, we design a training strategy that enables M$^2$IV to perform fine-grained semantic distillation and robust cross-modal representation learning. M$^2$IV not only improves performance across diverse tasks and LVLMs but also significantly reduces token overhead, enabling graceful scaling to many-shot scenarios. To further enhance usability, we introduce \textbf{VLibrary}, a repository that stores trained M$^2$IVs for flexible retrieval and injection. With VLibrary, users can steer pre-trained LVLMs in a customized manner that meets diverse requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that M$^2$IV consistently outperforms vanilla ICL and prior representation engineering baselines, achieving an average accuracy gain of 3.74\% with substantial improvements in overall efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM 2025, 30 pages, 10 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |

Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have spurred interest in automating echocardiographic interpretation. However, most existing medical VLMs rely on single-frame (image) inputs, which can reduce diagnostic accuracy for conditions identifiable only through cardiac motion. In addition, echocardiographic videos are captured from multiple views, each varying in suitability for detecting specific conditions. Leveraging multiple views may therefore improve diagnostic performance. We developed a video-language model that processes full video sequences from five standard views, trained on 60,747 echocardiographic video-report pairs. We evaluated the gains in retrieval performance from video input and multi-view support, including the contributions of various pretrained models.</p></details> |  |

Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly-Supervised 3D Visual Grounding based on Visual Language Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09625v5)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to ground natural language queries to target objects or regions in 3D point clouds is quite essential for 3D scene understanding. Nevertheless, existing 3D visual grounding approaches require a substantial number of bounding box annotations for text queries, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose 3D-VLA, a weakly supervised approach for 3D visual grounding based on Visual Linguistic Alignment. Our 3D-VLA exploits the superior ability of current large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) on aligning the semantics between texts and 2D images, as well as the naturally existing correspondences between 2D images and 3D point clouds, and thus implicitly constructs correspondences between texts and 3D point clouds with no need for fine-grained box annotations in the training procedure. During the inference stage, the learned text-3D correspondence will help us ground the text queries to the 3D target objects even without 2D images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate 3D visual grounding in a weakly supervised manner by involving large scale vision-language models, and extensive experiments on ReferIt3D and ScanRefer datasets demonstrate that our 3D-VLA achieves comparable and even superior results over the fully supervised methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hidden Tail: Adversarial Image Causing Stealthy Resource Consumption in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18805v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, but their high inference cost makes them vulnerable to resource consumption attacks. Prior attacks attempt to extend VLM output sequences by optimizing adversarial images, thereby increasing inference costs. However, these extended outputs often introduce irrelevant abnormal content, compromising attack stealthiness. This trade-off between effectiveness and stealthiness poses a major limitation for existing attacks. To address this challenge, we propose \textit{Hidden Tail}, a stealthy resource consumption attack that crafts prompt-agnostic adversarial images, inducing VLMs to generate maximum-length outputs by appending special tokens invisible to users. Our method employs a composite loss function that balances semantic preservation, repetitive special token induction, and suppression of the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, optimized via a dynamic weighting strategy. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Hidden Tail} outperforms existing attacks, increasing output length by up to 19.2$\times$ and reaching the maximum token limit, while preserving attack stealthiness. These results highlight the urgent need to improve the robustness of VLMs against efficiency-oriented adversarial threats. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangrui4041/Hidden_Tail.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Human-Object Interaction Evaluation for both Vision-Language Models and HOI-Specific Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18753v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized, affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing" is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current state of progress in HOI understanding.</p></details> |  |

Sign Language Instruction Generation (SLIG) produces step-by-step textual instructions that enable non-SL users to imitate and learn SL gestures, promoting two-way interaction. We introduce BdSLIG, the first Bengali SLIG dataset, used to evaluate Vision Language Models (VLMs) (i) on under-resourced SLIG tasks, and (ii) on long-tail visual concepts, as Bengali SL is unlikely to appear in the VLM pre-training data. To enhance zero-shot performance, we introduce Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting, which integrates standard SL parameters, like hand shape, motion, and orientation, directly into the textual prompts. Subsuming standard sign parameters into the prompt makes the instructions more structured and reproducible than free-form natural text from vanilla prompting. We envision that our work would promote inclusivity and advancement in SL learning systems for the under-resourced communities.</p></details> | CV4A11y@ICCV 2025 |
| **[Knowing or Guessing? Robust Medical Visual Question Answering via Joint Consistency and Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18687v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across diverse question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we reveal that current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) exhibit concerning fragility in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We attribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical concepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in training data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding. To address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original VQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level, sentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming performance drops (e.g., a 40\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA benchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, aligning Med-VLMs with medical knowledge rather than shallow feature patterns, and (2) bias-aware contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative representation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA benchmarks and notably improves answer consistency by 50\% on the challenging RoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness. Code will be released.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods primarily focused on single-robot centralized planning strategies, which severely limited exploration efficiency. Recent research has considered decentralized planning strategies for multiple robots, assigning separate planning models to each robot, but these approaches often overlook communication costs. In this work, we propose Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Co-Navigation (MCoCoNav), a modular approach that utilizes multimodal Chain-of-Thought to plan collaborative semantic navigation for multiple robots. MCoCoNav combines visual perception with Vision Language Models (VLMs) to evaluate exploration value through probabilistic scoring, thus reducing time costs and achieving stable outputs. Additionally, a global semantic map is used as a communication bridge, minimizing communication overhead while integrating observational results. Guided by scores that reflect exploration trends, robots utilize this map to assess whether to explore new frontier points or revisit history nodes. Experiments on HM3D_v0.2 and MP3D demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

To this end, we introduce PRISM (Principled Reasoning for Integrated Safety in Multimodality), a system2-like framework that aligns VLMs by embedding a structured, safety-aware reasoning process. Our framework consists of two key components: PRISM-CoT, a dataset that teaches safety-aware chain-of-thought reasoning, and PRISM-DPO, generated via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to further refine this reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization to help obtain a delicate safety boundary. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate PRISM's effectiveness, achieving remarkably low attack success rates including 0.15% on JailbreakV-28K for Qwen2-VL and 90% improvement over the previous best method on VLBreak for LLaVA-1.5. PRISM also exhibits strong robustness against adaptive attacks, significantly increasing computational costs for adversaries, and generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution challenges, reducing attack success rates to just 8.70% on the challenging multi-image MIS benchmark. Remarkably, this robust defense is achieved while preserving, and in some cases enhancing, model utility. To promote reproducibility, we have made our code, data, and model weights available at https://github.com/SaFoLab-WISC/PRISM.</p></details> |  |

It relies on a nuanced understanding of spatial structures and inter-object relationships, serving as the foundation for complex reasoning and decision-making. To investigate whether current vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit similar capability, we introduce Jigsaw-Puzzles, a novel benchmark consisting of 1,100 carefully curated real-world images with high spatial complexity. Based on this dataset, we design five tasks to rigorously evaluate VLMs' spatial perception, structural understanding, and reasoning capabilities, while deliberately minimizing reliance on domain-specific knowledge to better isolate and assess the general spatial reasoning capability. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 24 state-of-the-art VLMs. The results show that even the strongest model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves only 77.14% overall accuracy and performs particularly poorly on the Order Generation task, with only 30.00% accuracy, far below the performance exceeding 90% achieved by human participants. This persistent gap underscores the need for continued progress, positioning Jigsaw-Puzzles as a challenging and diagnostic benchmark for advancing spatial reasoning research in VLMs. Our project page is at https://zesen01.github.io/jigsaw-puzzles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Main conference</p></details> |

However, existing methods of visual affordance predictions often rely on manually annotated data or conditions only on a predefined set of tasks. We introduce UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation), a method for distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed $<$instruction, visual affordance$>$ pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to in-the-wild robotic scenes and to various human activities, despite only being trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10 demonstrations.

To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering (VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an 18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, Prepared for submission to IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems</p></details> |

In this work, we delve into the multilingual working pattern of LVLMs and identify a salient correlation between the multilingual understanding ability of LVLMs and language-specific neuron activations in shallow layers. Building on this insight, we introduce PLAST, a training recipe that achieves efficient multilingual enhancement for LVLMs by Precise LAnguage-Specific layers fine-Tuning. PLAST first identifies layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific neuron activations. These layers are then precisely fine-tuned with question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment. Our empirical results on MM-Bench and MMMB demonstrate that PLAST effectively improves the multilingual capabilities of LVLMs and achieves significant efficiency with only 14% of the parameters tuned. Further analysis reveals that PLAST can be generalized to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, facilitating the language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 findings</p></details> |

However, demographic biases remain a critical concern in FR, as these foundation models often fail to perform equitably across diverse demographic groups, considering ethnicity/race, gender, and age. Therefore, through our work DemoBias, we conduct an empirical evaluation to investigate the extent of demographic biases in LVLMs for biometric FR with textual token generation tasks. We fine-tuned and evaluated three widely used pre-trained LVLMs: LLaVA, BLIP-2, and PaliGemma on our own generated demographic-balanced dataset. We utilize several evaluation metrics, like group-specific BERTScores and the Fairness Discrepancy Rate, to quantify and trace the performance disparities. The experimental results deliver compelling insights into the fairness and reliability of LVLMs across diverse demographic groups. Our empirical study uncovered demographic biases in LVLMs, with PaliGemma and LLaVA exhibiting higher disparities for Hispanic/Latino, Caucasian, and South Asian groups, whereas BLIP-2 demonstrated comparably consistent.

| **[SafeBimanual: Diffusion-based Trajectory Optimization for Safe Bimanual Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18268v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bimanual manipulation has been widely applied in household services and manufacturing, which enables the complex task completion with coordination requirements. Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by 32.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is at: https://denghaoyuan123.github.io/SafeBimanip/</p></details> |
| **[MMTok: Multimodal Coverage Maximization for Efficient Inference of VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18264v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in understanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual input to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem. Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore, with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of coverage in token selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://project.ironieser.cc/mmtok</p></details> |

This in-depth review presents a structured exploration of the state-of-the-art in LVLMs, systematically organized through a three-step research review process. First, we discuss the functioning of vision language models (VLMs) for object detection, describing how these models harness natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques to revolutionize object detection and localization. We then explain the architectural innovations, training paradigms, and output flexibility of recent LVLMs for object detection, highlighting how they achieve advanced contextual understanding for object detection. The review thoroughly examines the approaches used in integration of visual and textual information, demonstrating the progress made in object detection using VLMs that facilitate more sophisticated object detection and localization strategies. This review presents comprehensive visualizations demonstrating LVLMs' effectiveness in diverse scenarios including localization and segmentation, and then compares their real-time performance, adaptability, and complexity to traditional deep learning systems. Based on the review, its is expected that LVLMs will soon meet or surpass the performance of conventional methods in object detection. The review also identifies a few major limitations of the current LVLM modes, proposes solutions to address those challenges, and presents a clear roadmap for the future advancement in this field. We conclude, based on this study, that the recent advancement in LVLMs have made and will continue to make a transformative impact on object detection and robotic applications in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First Peer Reviewed Review Paper for Object Detection with Vision-Language Models (VLMs)</p></details> |

We introduce SEAM, a benchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that have existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct notation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text pairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the textual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21 contemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision frequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems containing semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is relatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures that induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to visual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |

The modular framework was developed implementing differentiated processing strategies, effectively reducing memory requirements from 38GB to 16GB while maintaining model performance. The multi-agent architecture combines scene classification, vectorized memory, and multimodal interaction, enabling persistent storage and efficient retrieval of scene memories. Through perception-memory-reasoning workflows, the system provides environmental information beyond the current view using historical memories. Experiments show the quantized 19B-parameter model only experiences a 2.05% performance drop on MMBench and maintains 63.7 accuracy on OCR-VQA (original: 64.9), outperforming smaller models with equivalent memory requirements like the Molmo-7B series. The system maintains response latency between 2.83-3.52 seconds from scene analysis to initial speech output, substantially faster than non-streaming methods. This research advances computational efficiency and assistive technology, offering visually impaired users comprehensive real-time assistance in scene perception, text recognition, and navigation.</p></details> | 28 pages,9 figures |
| **[Controllable Hybrid Captioner for Improved Long-form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17047v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video.</p></details> |  |

Prevailing methods, often limited by shallow feature representation, inadequate reasoning mechanisms, and weak cross-modal integration, struggle to achieve this depth of cognition, resulting in prevalent issues like incomplete target separation and imprecise segmentation. Inspired by the perceptual strategy of the Hundred-eyed Giant-emphasizing holistic observation, omnidirectional focus, and intensive scrutiny-we introduce ArgusCogito, a novel zero-shot, chain-of-thought framework underpinned by cross-modal synergy and omnidirectional reasoning within Vision-Language Models (VLMs). ArgusCogito orchestrates three cognitively-inspired stages: (1) Conjecture: Constructs a strong cognitive prior through global reasoning with cross-modal fusion (RGB, depth, semantic maps), enabling holistic scene understanding and enhanced target-background disambiguation. (2) Focus: Performs omnidirectional, attention-driven scanning and focused reasoning, guided by semantic priors from Conjecture, enabling precise target localization and region-of-interest refinement. (3) Sculpting: Progressively sculpts high-fidelity segmentation masks by integrating cross-modal information and iteratively generating dense positive/negative point prompts within focused regions, emulating Argus' intensive scrutiny. Extensive evaluations on four challenging COS benchmarks and three Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) benchmarks demonstrate that ArgusCogito achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating the framework's exceptional efficacy, superior generalization capability, and robustness.</p></details> |  |

We address these limitations through an Architectural Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal fusion. Our method proposes a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation models to dense perception tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 reference, 3 figures, icassp 2026</p></details> |

However, these agents typically struggle with personalized instructions -- those containing ambiguous, user-specific context -- a challenge that has been largely overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we define personalized instructions and introduce PerInstruct, a novel human-annotated dataset covering diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios. Furthermore, given the limited personalization capabilities of existing mobile agents, we propose PerPilot, a plug-and-play framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to autonomously perceive, understand, and execute personalized user instructions. PerPilot identifies personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PerPilot effectively handles personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves its performance with continued use, underscoring the importance of personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents.

| **[3D Feature Distillation with Object-Centric Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18742v5)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grounding natural language to the physical world is a ubiquitous topic with a wide range of applications in computer vision and robotics. Recently, 2D vision-language models such as CLIP have been widely popularized, due to their impressive capabilities for open-vocabulary grounding in 2D images. Recent works aim to elevate 2D CLIP features to 3D via feature distillation, but either learn neural fields that are scene-specific and hence lack generalization, or focus on indoor room scan data that require access to multiple camera views, which is not practical in robot manipulation scenarios. Additionally, related methods typically fuse features at pixel-level and assume that all camera views are equally informative. In this work, we show that this approach leads to sub-optimal 3D features, both in terms of grounding accuracy, as well as segmentation crispness. To alleviate this, we propose a multi-view feature fusion strategy that employs object-centric priors to eliminate uninformative views based on semantic information, and fuse features at object-level via instance segmentation masks. To distill our object-centric 3D features, we generate a large-scale synthetic multi-view dataset of cluttered tabletop scenes, spawning 15k scenes from over 3300 unique object instances, which we make publicly available. We show that our method reconstructs 3D CLIP features with improved grounding capacity and spatial consistency, while doing so from single-view RGB-D, thus departing from the assumption of multiple camera views at test time. Finally, we show that our approach can generalize to novel tabletop domains and be re-purposed for 3D instance segmentation without fine-tuning, and demonstrate its utility for language-guided robotic grasping in clutter.</p></details> |  |

Trained on 12k professional lecture slides and evaluated on six academic talks (115 slides), our method achieved Pearson correlations up to 0.83 with human visual-quality ratings-1.79x to 3.23x stronger than scores from leading vision-language models (ChatGPT o4-mini-high, ChatGPT o3, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro). We demonstrate convergent validity with visual ratings, discriminant validity against speaker-delivery scores, and exploratory alignment with overall impressions. Our results show that augmenting low-level design cues with multimodal embeddings closely approximates audience perceptions of slide quality, enabling scalable, objective feedback in real time.</p></details> | 6 pages |

To further enhance these models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing (LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization. This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However, we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning. Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL, consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning. Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[PoRe: Position-Reweighted Visual Token Pruning for Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17807v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically process a significantly larger number of visual tokens compared to text tokens due to the inherent redundancy in visual signals. Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the computational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The text-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token pruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input. However, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing later in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's output. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens corresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning that disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom. In this paper, we present an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency bias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting mechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their spatial positions in the image. Our method, termed Position-reweighted Visual Token Pruning, is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly incorporated into existing visual token pruning frameworks without any changes to the model architecture or extra training. Extensive experiments on LVLMs demonstrate that our method improves the performance of visual token pruning with minimal computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Capability in Token Space: An Analysis of Large Vision Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18387v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated predictable scaling behaviors with respect to model parameters and training data. This study investigates whether a similar scaling relationship exist for vision-language models with respect to the number of vision tokens. A mathematical framework is developed to characterize a relationship between vision token number and the expected divergence of distance between vision-referencing sequences. The theoretical analysis reveals two distinct scaling regimes: sublinear scaling for less vision tokens and linear scaling for more vision tokens. This aligns with model performance relationships of the form \(S(n) \approx c / n^{\alpha(n)}\), where the scaling exponent relates to the correlation structure between vision token representations. Empirical validations across multiple vision-language benchmarks show that model performance matches the prediction from scaling relationship. The findings contribute to understanding vision token scaling in transformers through a theoretical framework that complements empirical observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSADF: Thinking Fast and Slow for Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08189v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are effective in well-defined environments, they often struggle to generalize their learned policies to dynamic settings due to their reliance on trial-and-error interactions. Recent work has explored applying Large Language Models (LLMs) or Vision Language Models (VLMs) to boost the generalization of RL agents through policy optimization guidance or prior knowledge. However, these approaches often lack seamless coordination between the RL agent and the foundation model, leading to unreasonable decision-making in unfamiliar environments and efficiency bottlenecks. Making full use of the inferential capabilities of foundation models and the rapid response capabilities of RL agents and enhancing the interaction between the two to form a dual system is still a lingering scientific question. To address this problem, we draw inspiration from Kahneman's theory of fast thinking (System 1) and slow thinking (System 2), demonstrating that balancing intuition and deep reasoning can achieve nimble decision-making in a complex world. In this study, we propose a Dual-System Adaptive Decision Framework (DSADF), integrating two complementary modules: System 1, comprising an RL agent and a memory space for fast and intuitive decision making, and System 2, driven by a VLM for deep and analytical reasoning. DSADF facilitates efficient and adaptive decision-making by combining the strengths of both systems. The empirical study in the video game environment: Crafter and Housekeep demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method, showing significant improvements in decision abilities for both unseen and known tasks.</p></details> |  |

To explore this, we introduce an analytical framework using systematically designed prompts on existing multimodal sarcasm datasets. Evaluating 12 state-of-the-art LVLMs over 2,409 samples, we examine interpretive variations within and across models, focusing on confidence levels, alignment with dataset labels, and recognition of ambiguous "neutral" cases. We further validate our findings on a diverse 100-sample mini-benchmark, incorporating multiple datasets, expanded prompt variants, and representative commercial LVLMs. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies -- across LVLMs and within the same model under varied prompts. While classification-oriented prompts yield higher internal consistency, models diverge markedly when tasked with interpretive reasoning. These results challenge binary labeling paradigms by highlighting sarcasm's subjectivity. We advocate moving beyond rigid annotation schemes toward multi-perspective, uncertainty-aware modeling, offering deeper insights into multimodal sarcasm comprehension. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/CoderChen01/LVLMSarcasmAnalysis</p></details> |  |

However, they often fail to meet users' actual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across long-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment Retrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments, comprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As a foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue retrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each naturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in real-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising real-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on these resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image fragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs, these models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within retrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval model trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning with multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and contextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally dense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum sampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and gradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in long, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.</p></details> |  |

We propose Language-Guided Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP), which leverages temporal cues from queries to adaptively prune video tokens, preserving contextual continuity while reducing computational overhead. Unlike uniform pruning or keyframe selection, LGTTP retains higher token density in temporally relevant segments. Our model-agnostic framework integrates with TimeChat and LLaVA-Video, achieving a 65% reduction in computation while preserving 97-99% of the original performance. On QVHighlights, LGTTP improves HIT@1 by +9.5%, and on Charades-STA, it retains 99.6% of R@1. It excels on queries with explicit temporal markers and remains effective across general video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a novel OOD detection framework based on vision-language models (VLMs), which integrates hierarchical visual information to cope with challenging unknown diseases that resemble known diseases. Specifically, a cross-scale visual fusion strategy is proposed to couple visual embeddings from multiple scales. This enriches the detailed representation of medical images and thus improves the discrimination of unknown diseases. Moreover, a cross-scale hard pseudo-OOD sample generation strategy is proposed to benefit OOD detection maximally. Experimental evaluations on three public medical datasets support that the proposed framework achieves superior OOD detection performance compared to existing methods.

| **[Dynamic Embedding of Hierarchical Visual Features for Efficient Vision-Language Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17638v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects visual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified sequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads to a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual information into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence length issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within the model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower visual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an efficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and fusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the inherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and language models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it dynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic granularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The fused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being directly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding layer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also dynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small number of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of cross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted experiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering on ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions. The results demonstrate that DEHVF achieves higher accuracy than existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) baselines while maintaining efficient training and inference.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we revisit temporal search paradigms for long-form video understanding and address a fundamental issue pertaining to all state-of-the-art (SOTA) long-context vision-language models (VLMs). Our contributions are twofold: First, we frame temporal search as a Long Video Haystack problem: finding a minimal set of relevant frames (e.g., one to five) from tens of thousands based on specific queries. Upon this formulation, we introduce LV-Haystack, the first dataset with 480 hours of videos, 15,092 human-annotated instances for both training and evaluation aiming to improve temporal search quality and efficiency. Results on LV-Haystack highlight a significant research gap in temporal search capabilities, with current SOTA search methods only achieving 2.1% temporal F1 score on the Longvideobench subset. Next, inspired by visual search in images, we propose a lightweight temporal search framework, T* that reframes costly temporal search as spatial search. T* leverages powerful visual localization techniques commonly used in images and introduces an adaptive zooming-in mechanism that operates across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments show that integrating T* with existing methods significantly improves SOTA long-form video understanding. Under an inference budget of 32 frames, T* improves GPT-4o's performance from 50.5% to 53.1% and LLaVA-OneVision-OV-72B's performance from 56.5% to 62.4% on the Longvideobench XL subset.

In this paper, we present TinyGiantVLM, a lightweight and modular two-stage framework designed for physical spatial reasoning, distinguishing itself from traditional geographic reasoning in complex logistics scenes. Our approach encodes both global and region-level features from RGB and depth modalities using pretrained visual backbones. To effectively handle the complexity of high-modality inputs and diverse question types, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion module, which dynamically combines spatial representations to support downstream reasoning tasks and improve convergence. Training is conducted in a two-phase strategy: the first phase focuses on generating free-form answers to enhance spatial reasoning ability, while the second phase uses normalized answers for evaluation. Evaluated on Track 3 of the AI City Challenge 2025, our 64M-parameter base model achieved 5th place on the leaderboard with a score of 66.8861, demonstrating strong performance in bridging visual perception and spatial understanding in industrial environments. We further present an 80M-parameter variant with expanded MoE capacity, which demonstrates improved performance on spatial reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) Workshops, 2025</p></details> |

However, MoEs introduce several inference-time challenges, including load imbalance across experts and the additional routing computational overhead. To address these challenges and fully harness the benefits of MoE, a systematic evaluation of hardware acceleration techniques is essential. We present MoE-Inference-Bench, a comprehensive study to evaluate MoE performance across diverse scenarios. We analyze the impact of batch size, sequence length, and critical MoE hyperparameters such as FFN dimensions and number of experts on throughput. We evaluate several optimization techniques on Nvidia H100 GPUs, including pruning, Fused MoE operations, speculative decoding, quantization, and various parallelization strategies. Our evaluation includes MoEs from the Mixtral, DeepSeek, OLMoE and Qwen families. The results reveal performance differences across configurations and provide insights for the efficient deployment of MoEs.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Multi-Level LVLM Guidance for Untrimmed Video Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17442v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition and localization in complex, untrimmed videos remain a formidable challenge in computer vision, largely due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing fine-grained actions, long-term temporal dependencies, and high-level semantic information from low-level visual features. This paper introduces the Event-Contextualized Video Transformer (ECVT), a novel architecture that leverages the advanced semantic understanding capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to bridge this gap. ECVT employs a dual-branch design, comprising a Video Encoding Branch for spatio-temporal feature extraction and a Cross-Modal Guidance Branch. The latter utilizes an LVLM to generate multi-granularity semantic descriptions, including Global Event Prompting for macro-level narrative and Temporal Sub-event Prompting for fine-grained action details. These multi-level textual cues are integrated into the video encoder's learning process through sophisticated mechanisms such as adaptive gating for high-level semantic fusion, cross-modal attention for fine-grained feature refinement, and an event graph module for temporal context calibration. Trained end-to-end with a comprehensive loss function incorporating semantic consistency and temporal calibration terms, ECVT significantly enhances the model's ability to understand video temporal structures and event logic. Extensive experiments on ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets demonstrate that ECVT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3 and mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Prompt Enhancement for Improving Zero-Shot Generalization of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17417v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale data exhibit promising zero-shot generalization but often suffer from semantic misalignment due to domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks. Existing approaches primarily focus on text prompting with class-specific descriptions and visual-text adaptation via aligning cropped image regions with textual descriptions. However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts and noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt enhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic perspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components: Topology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic Discriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of incomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates synonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and constructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy and persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual noise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative regions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model, effectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts. Given the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual prompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time adaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual alignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight Joint Optimization of General-Purpose Vision-Language Models and Retrievers for Medical Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17394v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical decision-making often involves interpreting images (e.g., radiology) for making diagnoses. Retrieving relevant visual information from medical literature and hospital records could enhance diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we develop a model in which a multimodal retriever is jointly optimized with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG where LVLM error signal is not propagated down to the retriever. We show that using only general-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able to achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel analysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved images each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these cases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these challenging cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle, and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room for improvement by future methods. Code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce MEENA (also known as PersianMMMU), the first dataset designed to evaluate Persian VLMs across scientific, reasoning, and human-level understanding tasks. Our dataset comprises approximately 7,500 Persian and 3,000 English questions, covering a wide range of topics such as reasoning, mathematics, physics, diagrams, charts, and Persian art and literature. Key features of MEENA include: (1) diverse subject coverage spanning various educational levels, from primary to upper secondary school, (2) rich metadata, including difficulty levels and descriptive answers, (3) original Persian data that preserves cultural nuances, (4) a bilingual structure to assess cross-linguistic performance, and (5) a series of diverse experiments assessing various capabilities, including overall performance, the model's ability to attend to images, and its tendency to generate hallucinations. We hope this benchmark contributes to enhancing VLM capabilities beyond English.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoViPAL: Layer-wise Contextualized Visual Token Pruning for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17243v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens, leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations. However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight, model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Simulating Vulnerabilities, and Threats in Multimodal Medical RAG System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17215v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual grounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting, we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports. These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters. While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of future multimodal medical RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sumbi...</summary><p>Sumbitted to 2025 AAAI main track</p></details> |

In this framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection, achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data, highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we apply this paradigm to the paper-to-poster generation problem, a practical yet time-consuming process faced by researchers preparing for conferences. While recent approaches have attempted to automate this task, most neglect core design and aesthetic principles, resulting in posters that require substantial manual refinement. To address these design limitations, we propose PosterGen, a multi-agent framework that mirrors the workflow of professional poster designers. It consists of four collaborative specialized agents: (1) Parser and Curator agents extract content from the paper and organize storyboard; (2) Layout agent maps the content into a coherent spatial layout; (3) Stylist agents apply visual design elements such as color and typography; and (4) Renderer composes the final poster. Together, these agents produce posters that are both semantically grounded and visually appealing. To evaluate design quality, we introduce a vision-language model (VLM)-based rubric that measures layout balance, readability, and aesthetic coherence. Experimental results show that PosterGen consistently matches in content fidelity, and significantly outperforms existing methods in visual designs, generating posters that are presentation-ready with minimal human refinements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://Y-Research-SBU.github.io/PosterGen</p></details> |

It was designed to advance the development and evaluation of vision-language models for agricultural decision-making and analysis. The PlantVillageVQA dataset comprises 193,609 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs grounded over 55,448 images spanning 14 crop species and 38 disease conditions. Questions are organised into 3 levels of cognitive complexity and 9 distinct categories.

The dataset was iteratively reviewed by domain experts for scientific accuracy and relevancy. The final dataset was evaluated using three state-of-the-art models for quality assessment. Our objective remains to provide a publicly available, standardised and expert-verified database to enhance diagnostic accuracy for plant disease identifications and advance scientific research in the agricultural domain.

In this work, we address the challenging task of food image-to-text matching, a critical component in applications such as dietary monitoring, smart kitchens, and restaurant automation. We propose F4-ITS: Fine-grained Feature Fusion for Food Image-Text Search, a training-free, vision-language model (VLM)-guided framework that significantly improves retrieval performance through enhanced multi-modal feature representations. Our approach introduces two key contributions: (1) a uni-directional(and bi-directional) multi-modal fusion strategy that combines image embeddings with VLM-generated textual descriptions to improve query expressiveness, and (2) a novel feature-based re-ranking mechanism for top-k retrieval, leveraging predicted food ingredients to refine results and boost precision. Leveraging open-source image-text encoders, we demonstrate substantial gains over standard baselines - achieving ~10% and ~7.7% improvements in top-1 retrieval under dense and sparse caption scenarios, and a ~28.6% gain in top-k ingredient-level retrieval. Additionally, we show that smaller models (e.g., ViT-B/32) can match or outperform larger counterparts (e.g., ViT-H, ViT-G, ViT-bigG) when augmented with textual fusion, highlighting the effectiveness of our method in resource-constrained settings.

Across 11 LLMs and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations, low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture task-specific units.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Interplay of Model Behavior and Model Internals Workshop co-located with COLM 2025</p></details> |

Central to our approach we introduce our new model, WebSight-7B, a fine-tuned vision-language model optimized for UI element interaction, trained using LoRA on a web-focused subset of the Wave-UI-25K dataset. WebSight integrates this model into a modular multi-agent architecture, comprising planning, reasoning, vision-action, and verification agents, coordinated through an episodic memory mechanism. WebSight-7B achieves a top-1 accuracy of 58.84% on the Showdown Clicks benchmark, outperforming several larger generalist models while maintaining lower latency. The full WebSight agent achieves a 68.0% success rate on the WebVoyager benchmark, surpassing systems from labs such as OpenAI (61.0%) and HCompany (Runner H, 67.0%). Among tasks completed, WebSight answers correctly 97.14% of the time, indicating high precision.

However, most existing methods provide only a final score without explanation or detailed analysis, limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce HieroAction, a vision-language model that delivers accurate and structured assessments of human actions. HieroAction builds on two key ideas: (1) Stepwise Action Reasoning, a tailored chain of thought process designed specifically for action assessment, which guides the model to evaluate actions step by step, from overall recognition through sub action analysis to final scoring, thus enhancing interpretability and structured understanding; and (2) Hierarchical Policy Learning, a reinforcement learning strategy that enables the model to learn fine grained sub action dynamics and align them with high level action quality, thereby improving scoring precision. The reasoning pathway structures the evaluation process, while policy learning refines each stage through reward based optimization. Their integration ensures accurate and interpretable assessments, as demonstrated by superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, efficient personalization of generated 3D content remains a critical challenge. Current 3D personalization approaches predominantly rely on knowledge distillation-based methods, which require computationally expensive retraining procedures. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{Invert3D}, a novel framework for convenient 3D content personalization. Nowadays, vision-language models such as CLIP enable direct image personalization through aligned vision-text embedding spaces. However, the inherent structural differences between 3D content and 2D images preclude direct application of these techniques to 3D personalization. Our approach bridges this gap by establishing alignment between 3D representations and text embedding spaces. Specifically, we develop a camera-conditioned 3D-to-text inverse mechanism that projects 3D contents into a 3D embedding aligned with text embeddings. This alignment enables efficient manipulation and personalization of 3D content through natural language prompts, eliminating the need for computationally retraining procedures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Invert3D achieves effective personalization of 3D content. Our work is available at: https://github.com/qsong2001/Invert3D.</p></details> |  |

Training VLA Models with Normalizing Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16845v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without compromising performance.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has evaluated cultural awareness in text-only models and VLM object recognition tasks, no research has systematically assessed how VLMs adapt outputs when cultural identity cues are embedded in both textual prompts and visual inputs during generative tasks. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of VLM cultural competence through multimodal story generation, developing a novel multimodal framework that perturbs cultural identity and evaluates 5 contemporary VLMs on a downstream task: story generation. Our analysis reveals significant cultural adaptation capabilities, with rich culturally-specific vocabulary spanning names, familial terms, and geographic markers. However, we uncover concerning limitations: cultural competence varies dramatically across architectures, some models exhibit inverse cultural alignment, and automated metrics show architectural bias contradicting human assessments. Cross-modal evaluation shows that culturally distinct outputs are indeed detectable through visual-semantic similarity (28.7% within-nationality vs. 0.2% cross-nationality recall), yet visual-cultural understanding remains limited. In essence, we establish the promise and challenges of cultural competence in multimodal AI.

While VLMs can recall factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic, detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we provide informed recommendations for future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at EMNLP 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total of 14 datasets.

However, ICL remains unstable, even with well-matched in-context demonstrations (ICDs), suggesting that LVLMs struggle to fully utilize the provided context. While existing efforts focus on prompt engineering or post-hoc logit calibration, we instead investigate the underlying attention dynamics to overcome LVLMs' inherent limitations. We identify two critical deficits in their self-attention that impair effective ICL. To bridge the gap, we propose \textbf{Context-Aware Modulated Attention} (CAMA), a plug-and-play and training-free method that dynamically modulates LVLM's attention logits based on the input in-context sequence. CAMA employs a two-stage attention modulation to address both identified deficits, enhancing the focus on semantically significant tokens, particularly visual ones. Across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks, CAMA consistently outperforms vanilla models and baselines, demonstrating great effectiveness and generalization. It can also activate the desired effects of prompt engineering methods and remains robust under diverse sequence configurations. Thus, CAMA paves the way for deeper explorations of attention dynamics to advance multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this paper we focus on the application of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring, where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents. Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates. This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over traditional training paradigms.</p></details> | 10pageV0 |
| **[RAGSR: Regional Attention Guided Diffusion for Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16158v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution (SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism, our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding. In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoSketch: VLM-assisted Style-Aware Vector Sketch Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06860v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to automatically complete a partial sketch that depicts a complex scene, e.g., "a woman chatting with a man in the park", is very useful. However, existing sketch generation methods create sketches from scratch; they do not complete a partial sketch in the style of the original. To address this challenge, we introduce AutoSketch, a styleaware vector sketch completion method that accommodates diverse sketch styles. Our key observation is that the style descriptions of a sketch in natural language preserve the style during automatic sketch completion. Thus, we use a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) to describe the styles of the partial sketches in natural language and replicate these styles using newly generated strokes. We initially optimize the strokes to match an input prompt augmented by style descriptions extracted from the VLM. Such descriptions allow the method to establish a diffusion prior in close alignment with that of the partial sketch. Next, we utilize the VLM to generate an executable style adjustment code that adjusts the strokes to conform to the desired style. We compare our method with existing methods across various sketch styles and prompts, performed extensive ablation studies and qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and demonstrate that AutoSketch can support various sketch scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, Hsiao-Yuan Chin and I-Chao Shen contributed equally to the paper</p></details> |
| **[Glo-VLMs: Leveraging Vision-Language Models for Fine-Grained Diseased Glomerulus Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15960v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained, disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics, aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained medical image classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Cache Enhanced Prototype Learning for Test-Time Generalization of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01225v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance.

| **[VIBE: Video-to-Text Information Bottleneck Evaluation for TL;DR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17423v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many decision-making tasks, where both accuracy and efficiency matter, still require human supervision. For example, tasks like traffic officers reviewing hour-long dashcam footage or researchers screening conference videos can benefit from concise summaries that reduce cognitive load and save time. Yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often produce verbose, redundant outputs that hinder task performance. Existing video caption evaluation depends on costly human annotations and overlooks the summaries' utility in downstream tasks. We address these gaps with Video-to-text Information Bottleneck Evaluation (VIBE), an annotation-free method that scores VLM outputs using two metrics: grounding (how well the summary aligns with visual content) and utility (how informative it is for the task). VIBE selects from randomly sampled VLM outputs by ranking them according to the two scores to support effective human decision-making. Human studies on LearningPaper24, SUTD-TrafficQA, and LongVideoBench show that summaries selected by VIBE consistently improve performance-boosting task accuracy by up to 61.23% and reducing response time by 75.77% compared to naive VLM summaries or raw video.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic-Aware Ship Detection with Vision-Language Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15930v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical task with wide-ranging applications, such as maritime activity monitoring, shipping logistics, and environmental studies. However, existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained semantic information, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel detection framework that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a multi-scale adaptive sliding window strategy. To facilitate Semantic-Aware Ship Detection (SASD), we introduce ShipSem-VL, a specialized Vision-Language dataset designed to capture fine-grained ship attributes. We evaluate our framework through three well-defined tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing SASD from multiple perspectives.</p></details> | 5 pages |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR (Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences" through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module, specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods (e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning, while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-empowered Dynamic Prompt Routing for Vision-Language Models Tuning under Long-Tailed Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15688v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs' pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks, including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mind and Motion Aligned: A Joint Evaluation IsaacSim Benchmark for Task Planning and Low-Level Policies in Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15663v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI. However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution, and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands. This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500 complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot. We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Devil is in the EOS: Sequence Training for Detailed Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20077v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Referring Expression Instance Retrieval and A Strong End-to-End Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18246v4)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using natural language to query visual information is a fundamental need in real-world applications. Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves a target image from a gallery based on an image-level description, while Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) localizes a target object within a given image using an instance-level description. However, real-world applications often present more complex demands. Users typically query an instance-level description across a large gallery and expect to receive both relevant image and the corresponding instance location. In such scenarios, TIR struggles with fine-grained descriptions and object-level localization, while REC is limited in its ability to efficiently search large galleries and lacks an effective ranking mechanism. In this paper, we introduce a new task called \textbf{Referring Expression Instance Retrieval (REIR)}, which supports both instance-level retrieval and localization based on fine-grained referring expressions. First, we propose a large-scale benchmark for REIR, named REIRCOCO, constructed by prompting advanced vision-language models to generate high-quality referring expressions for instances in the MSCOCO and RefCOCO datasets. Second, we present a baseline method, Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment with Relation Experts (CLARE), which employs a dual-stream architecture to address REIR in an end-to-end manner. Given a referring expression, the textual branch encodes it into a query embedding. The visual branch detects candidate objects and extracts their instance-level visual features. The most similar candidate to the query is selected for bounding box prediction. CLARE is first trained on object detection and REC datasets to establish initial grounding capabilities, then optimized via Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment (CLIA) for improved retrieval across images. We will release our code and benchmark publicly.</p></details> | ACMMM2025 |
