| **[Lost in Translation? Vocabulary Alignment for Source-Free Domain Adaptation in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15225v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce VocAlign, a novel source-free domain adaptation framework specifically designed for VLMs in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Our method adopts a student-teacher paradigm enhanced with a vocabulary alignment strategy, which improves pseudo-label generation by incorporating additional class concepts. To ensure efficiency, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model, preserving its original capabilities while minimizing computational overhead. In addition, we propose a Top-K class selection mechanism for the student model, which significantly reduces memory requirements while further improving adaptation performance. Our approach achieves a notable 6.11 mIoU improvement on the CityScapes dataset and demonstrates superior performance on zero-shot segmentation benchmarks, setting a new standard for source-free adaptation in the open-vocabulary setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>BMVC ...</summary><p>BMVC 2025 - Project Page: https://thegoodailab.org/blog/vocalign - Code: https://github.com/Sisso16/VocAlign</p></details> |
| **[OpenUrban3D: Annotation-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation of Large-Scale Urban Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10842v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation enables models to recognize and segment objects from arbitrary natural language descriptions, offering the flexibility to handle novel, fine-grained, or functionally defined categories beyond fixed label sets. While this capability is crucial for large-scale urban point clouds that support applications such as digital twins, smart city management, and urban analytics, it remains largely unexplored in this domain. The main obstacles are the frequent absence of high-quality, well-aligned multi-view imagery in large-scale urban point cloud datasets and the poor generalization of existing three-dimensional (3D) segmentation pipelines across diverse urban environments with substantial variation in geometry, scale, and appearance. To address these challenges, we present OpenUrban3D, the first 3D open-vocabulary semantic segmentation framework for large-scale urban scenes that operates without aligned multi-view images, pre-trained point cloud segmentation networks, or manual annotations. Our approach generates robust semantic features directly from raw point clouds through multi-view, multi-granularity rendering, mask-level vision-language feature extraction, and sample-balanced fusion, followed by distillation into a 3D backbone model. This design enables zero-shot segmentation for arbitrary text queries while capturing both semantic richness and geometric priors. Extensive experiments on large-scale urban benchmarks, including SensatUrban and SUM, show that OpenUrban3D achieves significant improvements in both segmentation accuracy and cross-scene generalization over existing methods, demonstrating its potential as a flexible and scalable solution for 3D urban scene understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Novel Category Discovery with X-Agent Attention for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01275v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge, existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored, making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent, an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2025</p></details> |
| **[DGL-RSIS: Decoupling Global Spatial Context and Local Class Semantics for Training-Free Remote Sensing Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00598v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD) module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS), under review</p></details> |
| **[Annotation-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation for Remote-Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18067v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp, a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images, where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and open-world Earth observation.</p></details> | <details><summary>All c...</summary><p>All codes and models will be released at https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-OV-2</p></details> |
| **[CitySeg: A 3D Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation Foundation Model in City-scale Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09470v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds is a critical technology for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perception systems, enabling the classification of 3D points without relying on any visual information to achieve comprehensive 3D understanding. However, existing models are frequently constrained by the limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual information.</p></details> |  |
| **[SynSeg: Feature Synergy for Multi-Category Contrastive Learning in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06115v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories. Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS). Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance, SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Free Class Purification for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00557v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However, the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS. Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance. However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity. The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP, as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when combined with other OVSS methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[OpenSeg-R: Improving Open-Vocabulary Segmentation via Step-by-Step Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16974v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) has drawn increasing attention for its capacity to generalize segmentation beyond predefined categories. However, existing methods typically predict segmentation masks with simple forward inference, lacking explicit reasoning and interpretability. This makes it challenging for OVS model to distinguish similar categories in open-world settings due to the lack of contextual understanding and discriminative visual cues. To address this limitation, we propose a step-by-step visual reasoning framework for open-vocabulary segmentation, named OpenSeg-R. The proposed OpenSeg-R leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to perform hierarchical visual reasoning before segmentation. Specifically, we generate both generic and image-specific reasoning for each image, forming structured triplets that explain the visual reason for objects in a coarse-to-fine manner. Based on these reasoning steps, we can compose detailed description prompts, and feed them to the segmentor to produce more accurate segmentation masks. To the best of our knowledge, OpenSeg-R is the first framework to introduce explicit step-by-step visual reasoning into OVS. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenSeg-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across five benchmark datasets. Moreover, it achieves consistent gains across all metrics on open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Qualitative results further highlight the effectiveness of our reasoning-guided framework in improving both segmentation precision and interpretability. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Hanzy1996/OpenSeg-R.</p></details> |  |
| **[CorrCLIP: Reconstructing Patch Correlations in CLIP for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10086v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to each pixel without being constrained by a predefined set of categories. While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in zero-shot classification, it struggles to align image patches with category embeddings because of its incoherent patch correlations. This study reveals that inter-class correlations are the main reason for impairing CLIP's segmentation performance. Accordingly, we propose CorrCLIP, which reconstructs the scope and value of patch correlations. Specifically, CorrCLIP leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to define the scope of patch interactions, reducing inter-class correlations. To mitigate the problem that SAM-generated masks may contain patches belonging to different classes, CorrCLIP incorporates self-supervised models to compute coherent similarity values, suppressing the weight of inter-class correlations. Additionally, we introduce two additional branches to strengthen patch features' spatial details and semantic representation. Finally, we update segmentation maps with SAM-generated masks to improve spatial consistency. Based on the improvement across patch correlations, feature representations, and segmentation maps, CorrCLIP achieves superior performance across eight benchmarks. Codes are available at: https://github.com/zdk258/CorrCLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 Oral</p></details> |
| **[FLOSS: Free Lunch in Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10487v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we challenge the conventional practice in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) of using averaged class-wise text embeddings, which are typically obtained by encoding each class name with multiple templates (e.g., a photo of <class>, a sketch of a <class>). We investigate the impact of templates for OVSS, and find that for each class, there exist single-template classifiers--which we refer to as class-experts--that significantly outperform the conventional averaged classifier. First, to identify these class-experts, we introduce a novel approach that estimates them without any labeled data or training. By leveraging the class-wise prediction entropy of single-template classifiers, we select those yielding the lowest entropy as the most reliable class-experts. Second, we combine the outputs of class-experts in a new fusion process. Our plug-and-play method, coined FLOSS, is orthogonal and complementary to existing OVSS methods, offering an improvement without the need for additional labels or training. Extensive experiments show that FLOSS consistently enhances state-of-the-art OVSS models, generalizes well across datasets with different distribution shifts, and delivers substantial improvements in low-data scenarios where only a few unlabeled images are available. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/FLOSS .</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025; Project Page: https://yasserben.github.io/FLOSS/</p></details> |
| **[FA-Seg: A Fast and Accurate Diffusion-Based Method for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23323v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets. Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the computation costs and the quality of the segmentation mask. In this work, we present FA-Seg, a Fast and Accurate training-free framework for open-vocabulary segmentation based on diffusion models. FA-Seg performs segmentation using only a (1+1)-step from a pretrained diffusion model. Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FA-Seg performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the segmentation quality, FA-Seg introduces three key components: (i) a dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction, (ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances semantic precision via multi-resolution attention fusion, and (iii) a Test-Time Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive experiments show that FA-Seg achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our results demonstrate that FA-Seg provides a strong foundation for extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference efficiency. The source code will be open-sourced after this paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized OVSS: Understanding Personal Concept in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11030v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) can segment an image into semantic regions based on arbitrarily given text descriptions even for classes unseen during training, it fails to understand personal texts (e.g., `my mug cup') for segmenting regions of specific interest to users. This paper addresses challenges like recognizing `my mug cup' among `multiple mug cups'. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel task termed \textit{personalized open-vocabulary semantic segmentation} and propose a text prompt tuning-based plug-in method designed to recognize personal visual concepts using a few pairs of images and masks, while maintaining the performance of the original OVSS. Based on the observation that reducing false predictions is essential when applying text prompt tuning to this task, our proposed method employs `negative mask proposal' that captures visual concepts other than the personalized concept. We further improve the performance by enriching the representation of text prompts by injecting visual embeddings of the personal concept into them. This approach enhances personalized OVSS without compromising the original OVSS performance. We demonstrate the superiority of our method on our newly established benchmarks for this task, including FSS$^\text{per}$, CUB$^\text{per}$, and ADE$^\text{per}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025; 15 pages</p></details> |
| **[Beyond-Labels: Advancing Open-Vocabulary Segmentation With Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16769v5)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation attempts to classify and outline objects in an image using arbitrary text labels, including those unseen during training. Self-supervised learning resolves numerous visual and linguistic processing problems when effectively trained. This study investigates simple yet efficient methods for adapting previously learned foundation models for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks. Our research proposes "Beyond-Labels", a lightweight transformer-based fusion module that uses a small amount of image segmentation data to fuse frozen visual representations with language concepts. This strategy allows the model to leverage the extensive knowledge of pre-trained models without requiring significant retraining, making the approach data-efficient and scalable. Furthermore, we capture positional information in images using Fourier embeddings, improving generalization and enabling smooth and consistent spatial encoding. We perform thorough ablation studies to examine the main components of our proposed method. On the standard benchmark PASCAL-5i, the method performs better despite being trained on frozen vision and language representations.

| **[RadZero: Similarity-Based Cross-Attention for Explainable Vision-Language Alignment in Radiology with Zero-Shot Multi-Task Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07416v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multi-modal models have significantly improved vision-language (VL) alignment in radiology. However, existing approaches struggle to effectively utilize complex radiology reports for learning and offer limited interpretability through attention probability visualizations. To address these challenges, we introduce RadZero, a novel framework for VL alignment in radiology with zero-shot multi-task capability. A key component of our approach is VL-CABS (Vision-Language Cross-Attention Based on Similarity), which aligns text embeddings with local image features for interpretable, fine-grained VL reasoning. RadZero leverages large language models to extract concise semantic sentences from radiology reports and employs multi-positive contrastive training to effectively capture relationships between images and multiple relevant textual descriptions. It uses a pre-trained vision encoder with additional trainable Transformer layers, allowing efficient high-resolution image processing. By computing similarity between text embeddings and local image patch features, VL-CABS enables zero-shot inference with similarity probability for classification, and pixel-level VL similarity maps for grounding and segmentation. Experimental results on public chest radiograph benchmarks show that RadZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation. Furthermore, VL similarity map analysis highlights the potential of VL-CABS for improving explainability in VL alignment. Additionally, qualitative evaluation demonstrates RadZero's capability for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness in medical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Image Augmentation for Semantic Segmentation in Outdoor Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00153v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of leaning-based perception algorithms suffer when deployed in out-of-distribution and underrepresented environments. Outdoor robots are particularly susceptible to rapid changes in visual scene appearance due to dynamic lighting, seasonality and weather effects that lead to scenes underrepresented in the training data of the learning-based perception system. In this conceptual paper, we focus on preparing our autonomous vehicle for deployment in snow-filled environments. We propose a novel method for diffusion-based image augmentation to more closely represent the deployment environment in our training data. Diffusion-based image augmentations rely on the public availability of vision foundation models learned on internet-scale datasets. The diffusion-based image augmentations allow us to take control over the semantic distribution of the ground surfaces in the training data and to fine-tune our model for its deployment environment. We employ open vocabulary semantic segmentation models to filter out augmentation candidates that contain hallucinations. We believe that diffusion-based image augmentations can be extended to many other environments apart from snow surfaces, like sandy environments and volcanic terrains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 IEEE ICRA Workshop on Field Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing the Multi-View Fusion Potential: Noise Correction in VLM for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22817v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding approaches mainly focus on training 3D networks through contrastive learning with point-text pairs or by distilling 2D features into 3D models via point-pixel alignment. While these methods show considerable performance in benchmarks with limited vocabularies, they struggle to handle diverse object categories as the limited amount of 3D data upbound training strong open-vocabulary 3d models. We observe that 2D multi-view fusion methods take precedence in understanding diverse concepts in 3D scenes. However, inherent noises in vision-language models lead multi-view fusion to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we introduce MVOV3D, a novel approach aimed at unleashing the potential of 2D multi-view fusion for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. We focus on reducing the inherent noises without training, thereby preserving the generalizability while enhancing open-world capabilities. Specifically, MVOV3D improves multi-view 2D features by leveraging precise region-level image features and text features encoded by CLIP encoders and incorporates 3D geometric priors to optimize multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, our MVOV3D achieves a new record with 14.7% mIoU on ScanNet200 and 16.2% mIoU on Matterport160 for challenge open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, outperforming current leading trained 3D networks by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReME: A Data-Centric Framework for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21233v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets. In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing OVS without training.

| **[LPOSS: Label Propagation Over Patches and Pixels for Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19777v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a training-free method for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation using Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs). Our approach enhances the initial per-patch predictions of VLMs through label propagation, which jointly optimizes predictions by incorporating patch-to-patch relationships. Since VLMs are primarily optimized for cross-modal alignment and not for intra-modal similarity, we use a Vision Model (VM) that is observed to better capture these relationships. We address resolution limitations inherent to patch-based encoders by applying label propagation at the pixel level as a refinement step, significantly improving segmentation accuracy near class boundaries. Our method, called LPOSS+, performs inference over the entire image, avoiding window-based processing and thereby capturing contextual interactions across the full image. LPOSS+ achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free methods, across a diverse set of datasets. Code: https://github.com/vladan-stojnic/LPOSS</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Depth and Language for Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09881v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) and domain generalization in semantic segmentation (DGSS) highlight a subtle complementarity that motivates Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (OV-DGSS). OV-DGSS aims to generate pixel-level masks for unseen categories while maintaining robustness across unseen domains, a critical capability for real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We introduce Vireo, a novel single-stage framework for OV-DGSS that unifies the strengths of OVSS and DGSS for the first time. Vireo builds upon the frozen Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) and incorporates scene geometry via Depth VFMs to extract domain-invariant structural features. To bridge the gap between visual and textual modalities under domain shift, we propose three key components: (1) GeoText Prompts, which align geometric features with language cues and progressively refine VFM encoder representations; (2) Coarse Mask Prior Embedding (CMPE) for enhancing gradient flow for faster convergence and stronger textual influence; and (3) the Domain-Open-Vocabulary Vector Embedding Head (DOV-VEH), which fuses refined structural and semantic features for robust prediction. Comprehensive evaluation on these components demonstrates the effectiveness of our designs. Our proposed Vireo achieves the state-of-the-art performance and surpasses existing methods by a large margin in both domain generalization and open-vocabulary recognition, offering a unified and scalable solution for robust visual understanding in diverse and dynamic environments. Code is available at https://github.com/anonymouse-9c53tp182bvz/Vireo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-time Contrastive Concepts for Open-world Semantic Segmentation with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05061v3)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent CLIP-like Vision-Language Models (VLMs), pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs to align both modalities with a simple contrastive objective, have paved the way to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Given an arbitrary set of textual queries, image pixels are assigned the closest query in feature space. However, this works well when a user exhaustively lists all possible visual concepts in an image that contrast against each other for the assignment. This corresponds to the current evaluation setup in the literature, which relies on having access to a list of in-domain relevant concepts, typically classes of a benchmark dataset. Here, we consider the more challenging (and realistic) scenario of segmenting a single concept, given a textual prompt and nothing else. To achieve good results, besides contrasting with the generic 'background' text, we propose two different approaches to automatically generate, at test time, query-specific textual contrastive concepts. We do so by leveraging the distribution of text in the VLM's training set or crafted LLM prompts. We also propose a metric designed to evaluate this scenario and show the relevance of our approach on commonly used datasets.</p></details> | TMLR camera-ready |

We assess state-of-the-art OVSS models on the proposed benchmark and investigate the key factors that impact the performance of zero-shot transfer models. Our work pioneers the creation of a robustness benchmark, offering valuable insights and establishing a foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Workshop on Foundation Models Meet Embodied Agents at CVPR 2025 (Non-archival Track)</p></details> |

To enhance out-of-domain generalization, we propose Cost Aggregation with Optimal Transport (OV-COAST) for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To align visual-language features within the framework of optimal transport theory, we employ cost volume to construct a cost matrix, which quantifies the distance between two distributions. Our approach adopts a two-stage optimization strategy: in the first stage, the optimal transport problem is solved using cost volume via Sinkhorn distance to obtain an alignment solution; in the second stage, this solution is used to guide the training of the CAT-Seg model. We evaluate state-of-the-art OVSS models on the MESS benchmark, where our approach notably improves the performance of the cost-aggregation model CAT-Seg with ViT-B backbone, achieving superior results, surpassing CAT-Seg by 1.72 % and SAN-B by 4.9 % mIoU.

| **[A Survey on Training-free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22209v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is one of the most fundamental tasks in image understanding with a long history of research, and subsequently a myriad of different approaches. Traditional methods strive to train models up from scratch, requiring vast amounts of computational resources and training data. In the advent of moving to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which asks models to classify beyond learned categories, large quantities of finely annotated data would be prohibitively expensive. Researchers have instead turned to training-free methods where they leverage existing models made for tasks where data is more easily acquired. Specifically, this survey will cover the history, nuance, idea development and the state-of-the-art in training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation that leverages existing multi-modal classification models. We will first give a preliminary on the task definition followed by an overview of popular model archetypes and then spotlight over 30 approaches split into broader research branches: purely CLIP-based, those leveraging auxiliary visual foundation models and ones relying on generative methods. Subsequently, we will discuss the limitations and potential problems of current research, as well as provide some underexplored ideas for future study. We believe this survey will serve as a good onboarding read to new researchers and spark increased interest in the area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21844v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, test-time adaptation has attracted wide interest in the context of vision-language models for image classification. However, to the best of our knowledge, the problem is completely overlooked in dense prediction tasks such as Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS). In response, we propose a novel TTA method tailored to adapting VLMs for segmentation during test time. Unlike TTA methods for image classification, our Multi-Level and Multi-Prompt (MLMP) entropy minimization integrates features from intermediate vision-encoder layers and is performed with different text-prompt templates at both the global CLS token and local pixel-wise levels. Our approach could be used as plug-and-play for any segmentation network, does not require additional training data or labels, and remains effective even with a single test sample. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive OVSS TTA benchmark suite, which integrates a rigorous evaluation protocol, seven segmentation datasets, and 15 common corruptions, with a total of 82 distinct test scenarios, establishing a standardized and comprehensive testbed for future TTA research in open-vocabulary segmentation. Our experiments on this suite demonstrate that our segmentation-tailored method consistently delivers significant gains over direct adoption of TTA classification baselines.</p></details> |  |

Current methods utilize text embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP but struggle with the inherent domain gap between image and text embeddings, even after extensive alignment during training. Additionally, relying solely on deep text-aligned features limits shallow-level feature guidance, which is crucial for detecting small objects and fine details, ultimately reducing segmentation accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a dual prompting framework, DPSeg, for this task. Our approach combines dual-prompt cost volume generation, a cost volume-guided decoder, and a semantic-guided prompt refinement strategy that leverages our dual prompting scheme to mitigate alignment issues in visual prompt generation. By incorporating visual embeddings from a visual prompt encoder, our approach reduces the domain gap between text and image embeddings while providing multi-level guidance through shallow features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on multiple public datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[3D Vision-Language Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07577v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models have propelled the development of multi-modal 3D scene understanding, which has vital applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual/augmented reality. However, current multi-modal scene understanding approaches have naively embedded semantic representations into 3D reconstruction methods without striking a balance between visual and language modalities, which leads to unsatisfying semantic rasterization of translucent or reflective objects, as well as over-fitting on color modality. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a solution that adequately handles the distinct visual and semantic modalities, i.e., a 3D vision-language Gaussian splatting model for scene understanding, to put emphasis on the representation learning of language modality. We propose a novel cross-modal rasterizer, using modality fusion along with a smoothed semantic indicator for enhancing semantic rasterization. We also employ a camera-view blending technique to improve semantic consistency between existing and synthesized views, thereby effectively mitigating over-fitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

These foundational models, especially CLIP, have accelerated research in open-vocabulary computer vision tasks, including Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS). Although the initial results are promising, the dense prediction capabilities of VLMs still require further improvement. In this study, we enhance the semantic segmentation performance of CLIP by introducing new modules and modifications: 1) architectural changes in the last layer of ViT and the incorporation of attention maps from the middle layers with the last layer, 2) Image Engineering: applying data augmentations to enrich input image representations, and 3) using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate definitions and synonyms for each class name to leverage CLIP's open-vocabulary capabilities. Our training-free method, ITACLIP, outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on segmentation benchmarks such as COCO-Stuff, COCO-Object, Pascal Context, and Pascal VOC.

However, most existing works over-trusted SAM to regularize image-level CLIP without any further refinement. Moreover, several existing works improved efficiency by dimensionality reduction of semantic features from 2D VLMs before fusing with 3DGS semantic fields, which inevitably leads to multi-view inconsistency. In this work, we propose econSG for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with 3DGS. Our econSG consists of: 1) A Confidence-region Guided Regularization (CRR) that mutually refines SAM and CLIP to get the best of both worlds for precise semantic features with complete and precise boundaries. 2) A low dimensional contextual space to enforce 3D multi-view consistency while improving computational efficiency by fusing backprojected multi-view 2D features and follow by dimensional reduction directly on the fused 3D features instead of operating on each 2D view separately. Our econSG shows state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets compared to the existing methods. Furthermore, we are also the most efficient training among all the methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling Spectral Graph for Object-Context Aware Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17150v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) has advanced with recent vision-language models (VLMs), enabling segmentation beyond predefined categories through various learning schemes. Notably, training-free methods offer scalable, easily deployable solutions for handling unseen data, a key goal of OVSS. Yet, a critical issue persists: lack of object-level context consideration when segmenting complex objects in the challenging environment of OVSS based on arbitrary query prompts. This oversight limits models' ability to group semantically consistent elements within object and map them precisely to user-defined arbitrary classes. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that overcomes this limitation by incorporating object-level contextual knowledge within images. Specifically, our model enhances intra-object consistency by distilling spectral-driven features from vision foundation models into the attention mechanism of the visual encoder, enabling semantically coherent components to form a single object mask. Additionally, we refine the text embeddings with zero-shot object presence likelihood to ensure accurate alignment with the specific objects represented in the images. By leveraging object-level contextual knowledge, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalizability across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods address this by sequentially connecting a powerful mask proposal generator, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP. But these two-stage approaches often suffer from high computational costs, memory inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose ESC-Net, a novel one-stage open-vocabulary segmentation model that leverages the SAM decoder blocks for class-agnostic segmentation within an efficient inference framework. By embedding pseudo prompts generated from image-text correlations into SAM's promptable segmentation framework, ESC-Net achieves refined spatial aggregation for accurate mask predictions. ESC-Net achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks, including ADE20K, PASCAL-VOC, and PASCAL-Context, outperforming prior methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate its robustness across challenging conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Autonomous assistive robots, such as smart wheelchairs, require robust capabilities in spatial segmentation and semantic recognition to navigate complex built environments effectively. Place segmentation involves delineating spatial regions like rooms or functional areas, while semantic recognition assigns semantic labels to these regions, enabling accurate localization to user-specific needs. Existing approaches often utilize deep learning; however, these close-vocabulary detection systems struggle to interpret intuitive and casual human instructions. Additionally, most existing methods ignore the uncertainty of the scene recognition problem, leading to low success rates, particularly in ambiguous and complex environments. To address these challenges, we propose an open-vocabulary scene semantic segmentation and detection pipeline leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach follows a 'Segment Detect Select' framework for open-vocabulary scene classification, enabling adaptive and intuitive navigation for assistive robots in built environments.</p></details> | 32 pages, 7 figures |

However, large shifts between training and test domains degrade their performance, requiring fine-tuning for effective real-world applications. We introduce Semantic Library Adaptation (SemLA), a novel framework for training-free, test-time domain adaptation. SemLA leverages a library of LoRA-based adapters indexed with CLIP embeddings, dynamically merging the most relevant adapters based on proximity to the target domain in the embedding space. This approach constructs an ad-hoc model tailored to each specific input without additional training. Our method scales efficiently, enhances explainability by tracking adapter contributions, and inherently protects data privacy, making it ideal for sensitive applications. Comprehensive experiments on a 20-domain benchmark built over 10 standard datasets demonstrate SemLA's superior adaptability and performance across diverse settings, establishing a new standard in domain adaptation for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Rethinking the Global Knowledge of CLIP in Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06818v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works modify CLIP to perform open-vocabulary semantic segmentation in a training-free manner (TF-OVSS). In vanilla CLIP, patch-wise image representations mainly encode homogeneous image-level properties, which hinders the application of CLIP to the dense prediction task. Previous TF-OVSS works sacrifice globality to enhance the locality of CLIP features, by making each patch mainly attend to itself or its neighboring patches within a narrow local window. With their modifications,the ability of CLIP to aggregate global context information is largely weakened. Differently, in this paper, we rethink the global knowledge encoded by CLIP and propose GCLIP to answer how to extract and utilize beneficial global knowledge of CLIP for TF-OVSS. As the representation of each patch is finally determined by the attention weights and the Value embeddings, we propose to reshape the last-block attention and Value embeddings to aggregate useful global context into final features. Firstly, we aim to equip the last-block attention with image-level properties while not introducing homogeneous attention patterns across patches. To realize the goal, we fuse the attention from the global-token emerging blocks with the Query-Query attention. Secondly, we aim to make Value embeddings of the last-block attention module more semantically correlated. To realize this, we design a novel channel suppression strategy.Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | Under review |

While current open-vocabulary approaches show impressive performance on standard segmentation benchmarks under zero-shot settings, they fall short of supervised counterparts on highly domain-specific datasets. We focus on segmentation-specific test-time optimization to address this gap. Segmentation requires an understanding of multiple concepts within a single image while retaining the locality and spatial structure of representations. We propose a novel self-supervised objective adhering to these requirements and use it to align the model parameters with input images at test time. In the textual modality, we learn multiple embeddings for each category to capture diverse concepts within an image, while in the visual modality, we calculate pixel-level losses followed by embedding aggregation operations specific to preserving spatial structure. Our resulting framework termed Seg-TTO is a plug-and-play module. We integrate Seg-TTO with three state-of-the-art OVSS approaches and evaluate across 22 challenging OVSS tasks covering a range of specialized domains. Our Seg-TTO demonstrates clear performance improvements (up to 27% mIoU increase on some datasets) establishing new state-of-the-art. Our code and models will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |

While this flexibility represents a significant advancement, current approaches still rely on manually specified class names as input, creating an inherent bottleneck in real-world applications. This work proposes a Vocabulary-Free Semantic Segmentation pipeline, eliminating the need for predefined class vocabularies. Specifically, we address the chicken-and-egg problem where users need knowledge of all potential objects within a scene to identify them, yet the purpose of segmentation is often to discover these objects. The proposed approach leverages Vision-Language Models to automatically recognize objects and generate appropriate class names, aiming to solve the challenge of class specification and naming quality. Through extensive experiments on several public datasets, we highlight the crucial role of the text encoder in model performance, particularly when the image text classes are paired with generated descriptions. Despite the challenges introduced by the sensitivity of the segmentation text encoder to false negatives within the class tagging process, which adds complexity to the task, we demonstrate that our fully automated pipeline significantly enhances vocabulary-free segmentation accuracy across diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to: Pattern Recognition Letters, Klara Reichard and Giulia Rizzoli equally contributed to this work</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Redundancy Reduction for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17642v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is an open-world task that aims to assign each pixel within an image to a specific class defined by arbitrary text descriptions. Recent advancements in large-scale vision-language models have demonstrated their open-vocabulary understanding capabilities, significantly facilitating the development of OVSS. However, most existing methods suffer from either suboptimal performance or long latency. This study introduces ERR-Seg, a novel framework that effectively reduces redundancy to balance accuracy and efficiency. ERR-Seg incorporates a training-free Channel Reduction Module (CRM) that leverages prior knowledge from vision-language models like CLIP to identify the most relevant classes while discarding others. Moreover, it incorporates Efficient Semantic Context Fusion (ESCF) with spatial-level and class-level sequence reduction strategies. CRM and ESCF result in substantial memory and computational savings without compromising accuracy. Additionally, recognizing the significance of hierarchical semantics extracted from middle-layer features for closed-set semantic segmentation, ERR-Seg introduces the Hierarchical Semantic Module (HSM) to exploit hierarchical semantics in the context of OVSS. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods under the ADE20K-847 setting, ERR-Seg achieves +$5.6\%$ mIoU improvement and reduces latency by $67.3\%$.</p></details> |  |
| **[InvSeg: Test-Time Prompt Inversion for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11473v2)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-textual correlations in the attention maps derived from text-to-image diffusion models are proven beneficial to dense visual prediction tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation. However, a significant challenge arises due to the input distributional discrepancy between the context-rich sentences used for image generation and the isolated class names typically used in semantic segmentation. This discrepancy hinders diffusion models from capturing accurate visual-textual correlations. To solve this, we propose InvSeg, a test-time prompt inversion method that tackles open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by inverting image-specific visual context into text prompt embedding space, leveraging structure information derived from the diffusion model's reconstruction process to enrich text prompts so as to associate each class with a structure-consistent mask. Specifically, we introduce Contrastive Soft Clustering (CSC) to align derived masks with the image's structure information, softly selecting anchors for each class and calculating weighted distances to push inner-class pixels closer while separating inter-class pixels, thereby ensuring mask distinction and internal consistency. By incorporating sample-specific context, InvSeg learns context-rich text prompts in embedding space and achieves accurate semantic alignment across modalities. Experiments show that InvSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context and COCO Object datasets.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[FGAseg: Fine-Grained Pixel-Text Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00877v2)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary segmentation aims to identify and segment specific regions and objects based on text-based descriptions. A common solution is to leverage powerful vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to bridge the gap between vision and text information. However, VLMs are typically pretrained for image-level vision-text alignment, focusing on global semantic features. In contrast, segmentation tasks require fine-grained pixel-level alignment and detailed category boundary information, which VLMs alone cannot provide. As a result, information extracted directly from VLMs can't meet the requirements of segmentation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose FGAseg, a model designed for fine-grained pixel-text alignment and category boundary supplementation. The core of FGAseg is a Pixel-Level Alignment module that employs a cross-modal attention mechanism and a text-pixel alignment loss to refine the coarse-grained alignment from CLIP, achieving finer-grained pixel-text semantic alignment. Additionally, to enrich category boundary information, we introduce the alignment matrices as optimizable pseudo-masks during forward propagation and propose Category Information Supplementation module. These pseudo-masks, derived from cosine and convolutional similarity, provide essential global and local boundary information between different categories. By combining these two strategies, FGAseg effectively enhances pixel-level alignment and category boundary information, addressing key challenges in open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FGAseg outperforms existing methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods mostly lift knowledge from large 2D vision models into 3DGS on a scene-by-scene basis, restricting the capabilities of open-vocabulary querying within their training scenes so that lacking the generalizability to novel scenes. In this work, we propose \textbf{OVGaussian}, a generalizable \textbf{O}pen-\textbf{V}ocabulary 3D semantic segmentation framework based on the 3D \textbf{Gaussian} representation. We first construct a large-scale 3D scene dataset based on 3DGS, dubbed \textbf{SegGaussian}, which provides detailed semantic and instance annotations for both Gaussian points and multi-view images. To promote semantic generalization across scenes, we introduce Generalizable Semantic Rasterization (GSR), which leverages a 3D neural network to learn and predict the semantic property for each 3D Gaussian point, where the semantic property can be rendered as multi-view consistent 2D semantic maps. In the next, we propose a Cross-modal Consistency Learning (CCL) framework that utilizes open-vocabulary annotations of 2D images and 3D Gaussians within SegGaussian to train the 3D neural network capable of open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across Gaussian-based 3D scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that OVGaussian significantly outperforms baseline methods, exhibiting robust cross-scene, cross-domain, and novel-view generalization capabilities. Code and the SegGaussian dataset will be released. (https://github.com/runnanchen/OVGaussian).</p></details> |  |

However, unlike vision-language models such as CLIP, self-supervised visual features are not readily aligned with language, hindering their adoption in open-vocabulary tasks. Our method, named dino.txt, unlocks this new ability for DINOv2, a widely used self-supervised visual encoder. We build upon the LiT training strategy, which trains a text encoder to align with a frozen vision model but leads to unsatisfactory results on dense tasks. We propose several key ingredients to improve performance on both global and dense tasks, such as concatenating the [CLS] token with the patch average to train the alignment and curating data using both text and image modalities. With these, we successfully train a CLIP-like model with only a fraction of the computational cost compared to CLIP while achieving state-of-the-art results in zero-shot classification and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Feature Pyramid Tokenization and Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14145v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The visual understanding are often approached from 3 granular levels: image, patch and pixel. Visual Tokenization, trained by self-supervised reconstructive learning, compresses visual data by codebook in patch-level with marginal information loss, but the visual tokens does not have semantic meaning. Open Vocabulary semantic segmentation benefits from the evolving Vision-Language models (VLMs) with strong image zero-shot capability, but transferring image-level to pixel-level understanding remains an imminent challenge. In this paper, we treat segmentation as tokenizing pixels and study a united perceptual and semantic token compression for all granular understanding and consequently facilitate open vocabulary semantic segmentation. Referring to the cognitive process of pretrained VLM where the low-level features are progressively composed to high-level semantics, we propose Feature Pyramid Tokenization (PAT) to cluster and represent multi-resolution feature by learnable codebooks and then decode them by joint learning pixel reconstruction and semantic segmentation. We design loosely coupled pixel and semantic learning branches. The pixel branch simulates bottom-up composition and top-down visualization of codebook tokens, while the semantic branch collectively fuse hierarchical codebooks as auxiliary segmentation guidance. Our experiments show that PAT enhances the semantic intuition of VLM feature pyramid, improves performance over the baseline segmentation model and achieves competitive performance on open vocabulary semantic segmentation benchmark. Our model is parameter-efficient for VLM integration and flexible for the independent tokenization. We hope to give inspiration not only on improving segmentation but also on semantic visual token utilization.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

To address this, researchers have explored two independent approaches: adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and leveraging synthetic data. However, VLMs often struggle with granularity, failing to disentangle fine-grained concepts, while synthetic data-based methods remain limited by the scope of available datasets. This paper proposes enhancing segmentation accuracy across diverse domains by integrating Vision-Language reasoning with key strategies for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). First, we improve the fine-grained segmentation capabilities of VLMs through multi-scale contextual data, robust text embeddings with prompt augmentation, and layer-wise fine-tuning in our proposed Foundational-Retaining Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (FROVSS) framework. Next, we incorporate these enhancements into a UDA framework by employing distillation to stabilize training and cross-domain mixed sampling to boost adaptability without compromising generalization. The resulting UDA-FROVSS framework is the first UDA approach to effectively adapt across domains without requiring shared categories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Vision-Text Representation Optimizing for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00744v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models, e.g. CLIP, have been increasingly used to address the challenging Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) task, benefiting from their well-aligned vision-text embedding space. Typical solutions involve either freezing CLIP during training to unilaterally maintain its zero-shot capability, or fine-tuning CLIP vision encoder to achieve perceptual sensitivity to local regions. However, few of them incorporate vision-text collaborative optimization. Based on this, we propose the Content-Dependent Transfer to adaptively enhance each text embedding by interacting with the input image, which presents a parameter-efficient way to optimize the text representation. Besides, we additionally introduce a Representation Compensation strategy, reviewing the original CLIP-V representation as compensation to maintain the zero-shot capability of CLIP. In this way, the vision and text representation of CLIP are optimized collaboratively, enhancing the alignment of the vision-text feature space. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to establish the collaborative vision-text optimizing mechanism within the OVS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior performance on popular OVS benchmarks. In open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches by +0.5, +2.3, +3.4, +0.4 and +1.1 mIoU, respectively on A-847, A-150, PC-459, PC-59 and PAS-20. Furthermore, in a panoptic setting on ADE20K, we achieve the performance of 27.1 PQ, 73.5 SQ, and 32.9 RQ.

Recent studies have expanded their applications in autonomous reconstruction through task assignment methods. However, these methods are mainly limited to single robot, and rapid reconstruction of large-scale scenes remains challenging. Additionally, task-driven planning based on surface uncertainty is prone to being trapped in local optima. To this end, we propose the first 3DGS-based centralized multi-robot autonomous 3D reconstruction framework. To further reduce time cost of task generation and improve reconstruction quality, we integrate online open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with surface uncertainty of 3DGS, focusing view sampling on regions with high instance uncertainty. Finally, we develop a multi-robot collaboration strategy with mode and task assignments improving reconstruction quality while ensuring planning efficiency. Our method demonstrates the highest reconstruction quality among all planning methods and superior planning efficiency compared to existing multi-robot methods. We deploy our method on multiple robots, and results show that it can effectively plan view paths and reconstruct scenes with high quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMSeg: Unleashing the Power of Large-Scale Models for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00364v1)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is widely agreed that open-vocabulary-based approaches outperform classical closed-set training solutions for recognizing unseen objects in images for semantic segmentation. Existing open-vocabulary approaches leverage vision-language models, such as CLIP, to align visual features with rich semantic features acquired through pre-training on large-scale vision-language datasets. However, the text prompts employed in these methods are short phrases based on fixed templates, failing to capture comprehensive object attributes. Moreover, while the CLIP model excels at exploiting image-level features, it is less effective at pixel-level representation, which is crucial for semantic segmentation tasks. In this work, we propose to alleviate the above-mentioned issues by leveraging multiple large-scale models to enhance the alignment between fine-grained visual features and enriched linguistic features. Specifically, our method employs large language models (LLMs) to generate enriched language prompts with diverse visual attributes for each category, including color, shape/size, and texture/material. Additionally, for enhanced visual feature extraction, the SAM model is adopted as a supplement to the CLIP visual encoder through a proposed learnable weighted fusion strategy. Built upon these techniques, our method, termed LMSeg, achieves state-of-the-art performance across all major open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks. The code will be made available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning in Hyperspherical Space for Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18840v2)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation seeks to label each pixel in an image with arbitrary text descriptions. Vision-language foundation models, especially CLIP, have recently emerged as powerful tools for acquiring open-vocabulary capabilities. However, fine-tuning CLIP to equip it with pixel-level prediction ability often suffers three issues: 1) high computational cost, 2) misalignment between the two inherent modalities of CLIP, and 3) degraded generalization ability on unseen categories. To address these issues, we propose H-CLIP a symmetrical parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy conducted in hyperspherical space for both of the two CLIP modalities. Specifically, the PEFT strategy is achieved by a series of efficient block-diagonal learnable transformation matrices and a dual cross-relation communication module among all learnable matrices. Since the PEFT strategy is conducted symmetrically to the two CLIP modalities, the misalignment between them is mitigated. Furthermore, we apply an additional constraint to PEFT on the CLIP text encoder according to the hyperspherical energy principle, i.e., minimizing hyperspherical energy during fine-tuning preserves the intrinsic structure of the original parameter space, to prevent the destruction of the generalization ability offered by the CLIP text encoder. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks show that H-CLIP achieves new SOTA open-vocabulary semantic segmentation results while only requiring updating approximately 4% of the total parameters of CLIP.</p></details> |  |

The key is to improve spatial representation of image-level CLIP, such as replacing self-attention map at last layer with self-self attention map or vision foundation model based attention map. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical framework, named CLIPer, that hierarchically improves spatial representation of CLIP. The proposed CLIPer includes an early-layer fusion module and a fine-grained compensation module. We observe that, the embeddings and attention maps at early layers can preserve spatial structural information. Inspired by this, we design the early-layer fusion module to generate segmentation map with better spatial coherence. Afterwards, we employ a fine-grained compensation module to compensate the local details using the self-attention maps of diffusion model. We conduct the experiments on seven segmentation datasets. Our proposed CLIPer achieves the state-of-the-art performance on these datasets. For instance, using ViT-L, CLIPer has the mIoU of 69.8% and 43.3% on VOC and COCO Object, outperforming ProxyCLIP by 9.2% and 4.1% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepange and code: https://linsun449.github.io/cliper</p></details> |

Nevertheless, traditional techniques such as global feature alignment or vision-language model distillation tend to impose only approximate correspondence, struggling notably with delineating fine-grained segmentation boundaries. To address this gap, we propose a more meticulous mask-level alignment between 3D features and the 2D-text embedding space through a cross-modal mask reasoning framework, XMask3D. In our approach, we developed a mask generator based on the denoising UNet from a pre-trained diffusion model, leveraging its capability for precise textual control over dense pixel representations and enhancing the open-world adaptability of the generated masks. We further integrate 3D global features as implicit conditions into the pre-trained 2D denoising UNet, enabling the generation of segmentation masks with additional 3D geometry awareness. Subsequently, the generated 2D masks are employed to align mask-level 3D representations with the vision-language feature space, thereby augmenting the open vocabulary capability of 3D geometry embeddings. Finally, we fuse complementary 2D and 3D mask features, resulting in competitive performance across multiple benchmarks for 3D open vocabulary semantic segmentation.

Pixel-level interpretation is a critical aspect of remote sensing image applications; however, a prevalent limitation remains the need for extensive manual annotation. For this, we try to introduce open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) into the remote sensing context. However, due to the sensitivity of remote sensing images to low-resolution features, distorted target shapes and ill-fitting boundaries are exhibited in the prediction mask. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple and general upsampler, SimFeatUp, to restore lost spatial information in deep features in a training-free style. Further, based on the observation of the abnormal response of local patch tokens to [CLS] token in CLIP, we propose to execute a straightforward subtraction operation to alleviate the global bias in patch tokens. Extensive experiments are conducted on 17 remote sensing datasets spanning semantic segmentation, building extraction, road detection, and flood detection tasks. Our method achieves an average of 5.8%, 8.2%, 4.0%, and 15.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods on 4 tasks.

Meanwhile, the recent Open-vocabulary Semantic Scene understanding based on large-scale vision language models is effective in open-set settings because it can learn diverse concepts and categories. However, these prior methods fail to generalize across different camera views due to the lack of cross-view geometric modeling. At present, there are limited studies analyzing cross-view learning. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Unsupervised Cross-view Adaptation Learning approach to modeling the geometric structural change across views in Semantic Scene Understanding. First, we introduce a novel Cross-view Geometric Constraint on Unpaired Data to model structural changes in images and segmentation masks across cameras. Second, we present a new Geodesic Flow-based Correlation Metric to efficiently measure the geometric structural changes across camera views. Third, we introduce a novel view-condition prompting mechanism to enhance the view-information modeling of the open-vocabulary segmentation network in cross-view adaptation learning. The experiments on different cross-view adaptation benchmarks have shown the effectiveness of our approach in cross-view modeling, demonstrating that we achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance compared to prior unsupervised domain adaptation and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS'24</p></details> |

Traditional RGB-T semantic segmentation models often struggle to generalize across diverse scenarios due to their reliance on pretrained models and predefined categories. Recent advancements in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have facilitated a shift from closed-set to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods. However, these models face challenges in dealing with intricate scenes, primarily due to the heterogeneity between RGB and thermal modalities. To address this gap, we present Open-RGBT, a novel open-vocabulary RGB-T semantic segmentation model. Specifically, we obtain instance-level detection proposals by incorporating visual prompts to enhance category understanding. Additionally, we employ the CLIP model to assess image-text similarity, which helps correct semantic consistency and mitigates ambiguities in category identification. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Open-RGBT achieves superior performance in diverse and challenging real-world scenarios, even in the wild, significantly advancing the field of RGB-T semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, unlike previous research that ignores the ``noise'' raised during feature projection from 2D to 3D, we propose a novel distillation learning framework named CUS3D. In our approach, an object-level denosing projection module is designed to screen out the ``noise'' and ensure more accurate 3D feature. Based on the obtained features, a multimodal distillation learning module is designed to align the 3D feature with CLIP semantic feature space with object-centered constrains to achieve advanced unsupervised semantic segmentation. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both unsupervised and open-vocabulary segmentation, and the results consistently showcase the superiority of our model in achieving advanced unsupervised segmentation results and its effectiveness in open-vocabulary segmentation.</p></details> | 6 pages,3 figures |

Meanwhile, vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, have showcased remarkable effectiveness in numerous zero-shot image-level tasks, owing to their robust generalizability. Recently, a body of work has investigated utilizing these models in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However, existing approaches often rely on impractical supervised pre-training or access to additional pre-trained networks. In this work, we propose a strong baseline for training-free OVSS, termed Neighbour-Aware CLIP (NACLIP), representing a straightforward adaptation of CLIP tailored for this scenario. Our method enforces localization of patches in the self-attention of CLIP's vision transformer which, despite being crucial for dense prediction tasks, has been overlooked in the OVSS literature. By incorporating design choices favouring segmentation, our approach significantly improves performance without requiring additional data, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or extensive hyperparameter tuning, making it highly practical for real-world applications.

However, existing approaches utilizing CLIP's text and patch embeddings to generate semantic masks often misidentify input pixels from unseen classes, leading to confusion between novel classes and semantically similar ones. In this work, we propose a novel approach, TagCLIP (Trusty-aware guided CLIP), to address this issue. We disentangle the ill-posed optimization problem into two parallel processes: semantic matching performed individually and reliability judgment for improving discrimination ability. Building on the idea of special tokens in language modeling representing sentence-level embeddings, we introduce a trusty token that enables distinguishing novel classes from known ones in prediction. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012, COCO-Stuff 164K and PASCAL Context. Our results show that TagCLIP improves the Intersection over Union (IoU) of unseen classes by 7.4%, 1.7% and 2.1%, respectively, with negligible overheads.

However, challenges arise due to limited event-based data and the absence of large-scale segmentation benchmarks. Current works are confined to closed-set semantic segmentation, limiting their adaptability to other applications. In this paper, we introduce OVOSE, the first Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation algorithm for Event cameras. OVOSE leverages synthetic event data and knowledge distillation from a pre-trained image-based foundation model to an event-based counterpart, effectively preserving spatial context and transferring open-vocabulary semantic segmentation capabilities. We evaluate the performance of OVOSE on two driving semantic segmentation datasets DDD17, and DSEC-Semantic, comparing it with existing conventional image open-vocabulary models adapted for event-based data. Similarly, we compare OVOSE with state-of-the-art methods designed for closed-set settings in unsupervised domain adaptation for event-based semantic segmentation. OVOSE demonstrates superior performance, showcasing its potential for real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/ram95d/OVOSE.</p></details> | conference |

Plenty of the previous art casts this task as pixel-to-text classification without object-level comprehension, leveraging the image-to-text classification capability of pretrained vision-and-language models. We argue that visual objects are distinguishable without the prior text information as segmentation is essentially a vision task. Lazy visual grounding first discovers object masks covering an image with iterative Normalized cuts and then later assigns text on the discovered objects in a late interaction manner. Our model requires no additional training yet shows great performance on five public datasets: Pascal VOC, Pascal Context, COCO-object, COCO-stuff, and ADE 20K.

While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models shine in recognizing visual concepts from text, they often struggle with segment coherence due to their limited localization ability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) excel at acquiring spatially consistent local visual representations, yet they fall short in semantic understanding. This paper introduces ProxyCLIP, an innovative framework designed to harmonize the strengths of both CLIP and VFMs, facilitating enhanced open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. ProxyCLIP leverages the spatial feature correspondence from VFMs as a form of proxy attention to augment CLIP, thereby inheriting the VFMs' robust local consistency and maintaining CLIP's exceptional zero-shot transfer capacity. We propose an adaptive normalization and masking strategy to get the proxy attention from VFMs, allowing for adaptation across different VFMs. Remarkably, as a training-free approach, ProxyCLIP significantly improves the average mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) across eight benchmarks from 40.3 to 44.4, showcasing its exceptional efficacy in bridging the gap between spatial precision and semantic richness for the open-vocabulary segmentation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

In this paper, we carefully re-investigate the architecture of CLIP, and identify residual connections as the primary source of noise that degrades segmentation quality. With a comparative analysis of statistical properties in the residual connection and the attention output across different pretrained models, we discover that CLIP's image-text contrastive training paradigm emphasizes global features at the expense of local discriminability, leading to noisy segmentation results. In response, we propose ClearCLIP, a novel approach that decomposes CLIP's representations to enhance open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. We introduce three simple modifications to the final layer: removing the residual connection, implementing the self-self attention, and discarding the feed-forward network. ClearCLIP consistently generates clearer and more accurate segmentation maps and outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks, affirming the significance of our discoveries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024. code available at https://github.com/mc- lan/ClearCLIP</p></details> |

However, it is not only costly to obtain training-sufficient dense-annotated panoramas but also application-restricted when training models in a close-vocabulary setting. To tackle this problem, in this work, we define a new task termed Open Panoramic Segmentation (OPS), where models are trained with FoV-restricted pinhole images in the source domain in an open-vocabulary setting while evaluated with FoV-open panoramic images in the target domain, enabling the zero-shot open panoramic semantic segmentation ability of models. Moreover, we propose a model named OOOPS with a Deformable Adapter Network (DAN), which significantly improves zero-shot panoramic semantic segmentation performance. To further enhance the distortion-aware modeling ability from the pinhole source domain, we propose a novel data augmentation method called Random Equirectangular Projection (RERP) which is specifically designed to address object deformations in advance. Surpassing other state-of-the-art open-vocabulary semantic segmentation approaches, a remarkable performance boost on three panoramic datasets, WildPASS, Stanford2D3D, and Matterport3D, proves the effectiveness of our proposed OOOPS model with RERP on the OPS task, especially +2.2% on outdoor WildPASS and +2.4% mIoU on indoor Stanford2D3D.

However, leveraging the learned association for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet extremely effective, training-free technique, Plug-and-Play Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (PnP-OVSS) for this task. PnP-OVSS leverages a VLM with direct text-to-image cross-attention and an image-text matching loss.

PnP-OVSS does not require any neural network training and performs hyperparameter tuning without the need for any segmentation annotations, even for a validation set. PnP-OVSS demonstrates substantial improvements over comparable baselines (+26.2% mIoU on Pascal VOC, +20.5% mIoU on MS COCO, +3.1% mIoU on COCO Stuff and +3.0% mIoU on ADE20K).

| **[Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Image Embedding Balancing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09829v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is a challenging task, which requires the model to output semantic masks of an image beyond a close-set vocabulary. Although many efforts have been made to utilize powerful CLIP models to accomplish this task, they are still easily overfitting to training classes due to the natural gaps in semantic information between training and new classes. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel framework for openvocabulary semantic segmentation called EBSeg, incorporating an Adaptively Balanced Decoder (AdaB Decoder) and a Semantic Structure Consistency loss (SSC Loss). The AdaB Decoder is designed to generate different image embeddings for both training and new classes. Subsequently, these two types of embeddings are adaptively balanced to fully exploit their ability to recognize training classes and generalization ability for new classes. To learn a consistent semantic structure from CLIP, the SSC Loss aligns the inter-classes affinity in the image feature space with that in the text feature space of CLIP, thereby improving the generalization ability of our model. Furthermore, we employ a frozen SAM image encoder to complement the spatial information that CLIP features lack due to the low training image resolution and image-level supervision inherent in CLIP. Extensive experiments conducted across various benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed EBSeg outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Previous works have trained over large amounts of image-caption pairs to enforce pixel-level multimodal alignments. However, captions provide global information about the semantics of a given image but lack direct localization of individual concepts. Further, training on large-scale datasets inevitably brings significant computational costs. In this paper, we propose FreeDA, a training-free diffusion-augmented method for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which leverages the ability of diffusion models to visually localize generated concepts and local-global similarities to match class-agnostic regions with semantic classes. Our approach involves an offline stage in which textual-visual reference embeddings are collected, starting from a large set of captions and leveraging visual and semantic contexts. At test time, these are queried to support the visual matching process, which is carried out by jointly considering class-agnostic regions and global semantic similarities. Extensive analyses demonstrate that FreeDA achieves state-of-the-art performance on five datasets, surpassing previous methods by more than 7.0 average points in terms of mIoU and without requiring any training.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024.

However, most previous best-performing methods, whether pixel grouping methods or region recognition methods, suffer from false matches between image features and category labels. We attribute this to the natural gap between the textual features and visual features. In this work, we rethink how to mitigate false matches from the perspective of image-to-image matching and propose a novel relation-aware intra-modal matching (RIM) framework for OVS based on visual foundation models. RIM achieves robust region classification by firstly constructing diverse image-modal reference features and then matching them with region features based on relation-aware ranking distribution. The proposed RIM enjoys several merits. First, the intra-modal reference features are better aligned, circumventing potential ambiguities that may arise in cross-modal matching. Second, the ranking-based matching process harnesses the structure information implicit in the inter-class relationships, making it more robust than comparing individually.

However, its lack of spatial awareness makes it unsuitable for dense computer vision tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation, without an additional fine-tuning step that often uses annotations and can potentially suppress its original open-vocabulary properties. Meanwhile, self-supervised representation methods have demonstrated good localization properties without human-made annotations nor explicit supervision. In this work, we take the best of both worlds and propose an open-vocabulary semantic segmentation method, which does not require any annotations. We propose to locally improve dense MaskCLIP features, which are computed with a simple modification of CLIP's last pooling layer, by integrating localization priors extracted from self-supervised features. By doing so, we greatly improve the performance of MaskCLIP and produce smooth outputs. Moreover, we show that the used self-supervised feature properties can directly be learnt from CLIP features. Our method CLIP-DINOiser needs only a single forward pass of CLIP and two light convolutional layers at inference, no extra supervision nor extra memory and reaches state-of-the-art results on challenging and fine-grained benchmarks such as COCO, Pascal Context, Cityscapes and ADE20k. The code to reproduce our results is available at https://github.com/wysoczanska/clip_dinoiser.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAG: Guidance-free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11197v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision, where each pixel in an image is classified into a category. However, traditional methods face significant challenges, including the need for pixel-level annotations and extensive training. Furthermore, because supervised learning uses a limited set of predefined categories, models typically struggle with rare classes and cannot recognize new ones. Unsupervised and open-vocabulary segmentation, proposed to tackle these issues, faces challenges, including the inability to assign specific class labels to clusters and the necessity of user-provided text queries for guidance. In this context, we propose a novel approach, TAG which achieves Training, Annotation, and Guidance-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. TAG utilizes pre-trained models such as CLIP and DINO to segment images into meaningful categories without additional training or dense annotations. It retrieves class labels from an external database, providing flexibility to adapt to new scenarios. Our TAG achieves state-of-the-art results on PascalVOC, PascalContext and ADE20K for open-vocabulary segmentation without given class names, i.e. improvement of +15.3 mIoU on PascalVOC.

Additionally, due to the limited predefined categories in supervised learning, models typically struggle with infrequent classes and are unable to predict novel classes. To address these limitations, we propose MaskDiffusion, an innovative approach that leverages pretrained frozen Stable Diffusion to achieve open-vocabulary semantic segmentation without the need for additional training or annotation, leading to improved performance compared to similar methods. We also demonstrate the superior performance of MaskDiffusion in handling open vocabularies, including fine-grained and proper noun-based categories, thus expanding the scope of segmentation applications. Overall, our MaskDiffusion shows significant qualitative and quantitative improvements in contrast to other comparable unsupervised segmentation methods, i.e. on the Potsdam dataset (+10.5 mIoU compared to GEM) and COCO-Stuff (+14.8 mIoU compared to DiffSeg).

| **[Multi-Grained Cross-modal Alignment for Learning Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation from Text Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03707v1)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, learning open-vocabulary semantic segmentation from text supervision has achieved promising downstream performance. Nevertheless, current approaches encounter an alignment granularity gap owing to the absence of dense annotations, wherein they learn coarse image/region-text alignment during training yet perform group/pixel-level predictions at inference. Such discrepancy leads to suboptimal learning efficiency and inferior zero-shot segmentation results. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Grained Cross-modal Alignment (MGCA) framework, which explicitly learns pixel-level alignment along with object- and region-level alignment to bridge the granularity gap without any dense annotations. Specifically, MGCA ingeniously constructs pseudo multi-granular semantic correspondences upon image-text pairs and collaborates with hard sampling strategies to facilitate fine-grained cross-modal contrastive learning. Further, we point out the defects of existing group and pixel prediction units in downstream segmentation and develop an adaptive semantic unit which effectively mitigates their dilemmas including under- and over-segmentation. Training solely on CC3M, our method achieves significant advancements over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

Most existing methods explore utilizing pre-trained vision-language models, in which the key is to adopt the image-level model for pixel-level segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a simple encoder-decoder, named SED, for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which comprises a hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation and a gradual fusion decoder with category early rejection. The hierarchical encoder-based cost map generation employs hierarchical backbone, instead of plain transformer, to predict pixel-level image-text cost map. Compared to plain transformer, hierarchical backbone better captures local spatial information and has linear computational complexity with respect to input size. Our gradual fusion decoder employs a top-down structure to combine cost map and the feature maps of different backbone levels for segmentation. To accelerate inference speed, we introduce a category early rejection scheme in the decoder that rejects many no-existing categories at the early layer of decoder, resulting in at most 4.7 times acceleration without accuracy degradation. Experiments are performed on multiple open-vocabulary semantic segmentation datasets, which demonstrates the efficacy of our SED method. When using ConvNeXt-B, our SED method achieves mIoU score of 31.6\% on ADE20K with 150 categories at 82 millisecond ($ms$) per image on a single A6000. We will release it at \url{https://github.com/xb534/SED.git}.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 |
| **[Generalizable Semantic Vision Query Generation for Zero-shot Panoptic and Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13697v1)** | 2024-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Panoptic Segmentation (ZPS) aims to recognize foreground instances and background stuff without images containing unseen categories in training. Due to the visual data sparsity and the difficulty of generalizing from seen to unseen categories, this task remains challenging. To better generalize to unseen classes, we propose Conditional tOken aligNment and Cycle trAnsiTion (CONCAT), to produce generalizable semantic vision queries. First, a feature extractor is trained by CON to link the vision and semantics for providing target queries. Formally, CON is proposed to align the semantic queries with the CLIP visual CLS token extracted from complete and masked images. To address the lack of unseen categories, a generator is required. However, one of the gaps in synthesizing pseudo vision queries, ie, vision queries for unseen categories, is describing fine-grained visual details through semantic embeddings. Therefore, we approach CAT to train the generator in semantic-vision and vision-semantic manners. In semantic-vision, visual query contrast is proposed to model the high granularity of vision by pulling the pseudo vision queries with the corresponding targets containing segments while pushing those without segments away. To ensure the generated queries retain semantic information, in vision-semantic, the pseudo vision queries are mapped back to semantic and supervised by real semantic embeddings. Experiments on ZPS achieve a 5.2% hPQ increase surpassing SOTA. We also examine inductive ZPS and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation and obtain comparative results while being 2 times faster in testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Generative and Discriminative Models for Unified Visual Perception with Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16459v1)** | 2024-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable prowess of diffusion models in image generation has spurred efforts to extend their application beyond generative tasks. However, a persistent challenge exists in lacking a unified approach to apply diffusion models to visual perception tasks with diverse semantic granularity requirements. Our purpose is to establish a unified visual perception framework, capitalizing on the potential synergies between generative and discriminative models. In this paper, we propose Vermouth, a simple yet effective framework comprising a pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model containing rich generative priors, a unified head (U-head) capable of integrating hierarchical representations, and an adapted expert providing discriminative priors. Comprehensive investigations unveil potential characteristics of Vermouth, such as varying granularity of perception concealed in latent variables at distinct time steps and various U-net stages. We emphasize that there is no necessity for incorporating a heavyweight or intricate decoder to transform diffusion models into potent representation learners. Extensive comparative evaluations against tailored discriminative models showcase the efficacy of our approach on zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR), few-shot classification, and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks. The promising results demonstrate the potential of diffusion models as formidable learners, establishing their significance in furnishing informative and robust visual representations.</p></details> | 18 pages,11 figures |
| **[Exploring Simple Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12217v1)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation models aim to accurately assign a semantic label to each pixel in an image from a set of arbitrary open-vocabulary texts. In order to learn such pixel-level alignment, current approaches typically rely on a combination of (i) image-level VL model (e.g. CLIP), (ii) ground truth masks, and (iii) custom grouping encoders. In this paper, we introduce S-Seg, a novel model that can achieve surprisingly strong performance without depending on any of the above elements. S-Seg leverages pseudo-mask and language to train a MaskFormer, and can be easily trained from publicly available image-text datasets. Contrary to prior works, our model directly trains for pixel-level features and language alignment. Once trained, S-Seg generalizes well to multiple testing datasets without requiring fine-tuning. In addition, S-Seg has the extra benefits of scalability with data and consistently improvement when augmented with self-training. We believe that our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/zlai0/S-Seg</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Model is Secretly a Training-free Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmenter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02773v3)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-trained text-image discriminative models, such as CLIP, has been explored for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with unsatisfactory results due to the loss of crucial localization information and awareness of object shapes. Recently, there has been a growing interest in expanding the application of generative models from generation tasks to semantic segmentation. These approaches utilize generative models either for generating annotated data or extracting features to facilitate semantic segmentation. This typically involves generating a considerable amount of synthetic data or requiring additional mask annotations. To this end, we uncover the potential of generative text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) as highly efficient open-vocabulary semantic segmenters, and introduce a novel training-free approach named DiffSegmenter. The insight is that to generate realistic objects that are semantically faithful to the input text, both the complete object shapes and the corresponding semantics are implicitly learned by diffusion models. We discover that the object shapes are characterized by the self-attention maps while the semantics are indicated through the cross-attention maps produced by the denoising U-Net, forming the basis of our segmentation results.Additionally, we carefully design effective textual prompts and a category filtering mechanism to further enhance the segmentation results. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed DiffSegmenter achieves impressive results for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Such methods are able to segment scenes into arbitrary classes based on text descriptions provided during runtime. In this paper, we propose to the best of our knowledge the first algorithm for open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation in 3D scenes. Our algorithm, Panoptic Vision-Language Feature Fields (PVLFF), learns a semantic feature field of the scene by distilling vision-language features from a pretrained 2D model, and jointly fits an instance feature field through contrastive learning using 2D instance segments on input frames. Despite not being trained on the target classes, our method achieves panoptic segmentation performance similar to the state-of-the-art closed-set 3D systems on the HyperSim, ScanNet and Replica dataset and additionally outperforms current 3D open-vocabulary systems in terms of semantic segmentation. We ablate the components of our method to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model architecture.

| **[AttrSeg: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation via Attribute Decomposition-Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00096v2)** | 2024-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is a challenging task that requires segmenting novel object categories at inference time. Recent studies have explored vision-language pre-training to handle this task, but suffer from unrealistic assumptions in practical scenarios, i.e., low-quality textual category names. For example, this paradigm assumes that new textual categories will be accurately and completely provided, and exist in lexicons during pre-training. However, exceptions often happen when encountering ambiguity for brief or incomplete names, new words that are not present in the pre-trained lexicons, and difficult-to-describe categories for users. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel attribute decomposition-aggregation framework, AttrSeg, inspired by human cognition in understanding new concepts. Specifically, in the decomposition stage, we decouple class names into diverse attribute descriptions to complement semantic contexts from multiple perspectives. Two attribute construction strategies are designed: using large language models for common categories, and involving manually labeling for human-invented categories. In the aggregation stage, we group diverse attributes into an integrated global description, to form a discriminative classifier that distinguishes the target object from others. One hierarchical aggregation architecture is further proposed to achieve multi-level aggregations, leveraging the meticulously designed clustering module. The final results are obtained by computing the similarity between aggregated attributes and images embeddings. To evaluate the effectiveness, we annotate three types of datasets with attribute descriptions, and conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies. The results show the superior performance of attribute decomposition-aggregation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |

The zero-shot classification capabilities of the model are impressive but are harder to use for dense tasks such as image segmentation. Several methods have proposed different modifications and learning schemes to produce dense output. Instead, we propose in this work an open-vocabulary semantic segmentation method, dubbed CLIP-DIY, which does not require any additional training or annotations, but instead leverages existing unsupervised object localization approaches. In particular, CLIP-DIY is a multi-scale approach that directly exploits CLIP classification abilities on patches of different sizes and aggregates the decision in a single map. We further guide the segmentation using foreground/background scores obtained using unsupervised object localization methods. With our method, we obtain state-of-the-art zero-shot semantic segmentation results on PASCAL VOC and perform on par with the best methods on COCO.

| **[Convolutions Die Hard: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation with Single Frozen Convolutional CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02487v2)** | 2023-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary segmentation is a challenging task requiring segmenting and recognizing objects from an open set of categories. One way to address this challenge is to leverage multi-modal models, such as CLIP, to provide image and text features in a shared embedding space, which bridges the gap between closed-vocabulary and open-vocabulary recognition. Hence, existing methods often adopt a two-stage framework to tackle the problem, where the inputs first go through a mask generator and then through the CLIP model along with the predicted masks. This process involves extracting features from images multiple times, which can be ineffective and inefficient. By contrast, we propose to build everything into a single-stage framework using a shared Frozen Convolutional CLIP backbone, which not only significantly simplifies the current two-stage pipeline, but also remarkably yields a better accuracy-cost trade-off. The proposed FC-CLIP, benefits from the following observations: the frozen CLIP backbone maintains the ability of open-vocabulary classification and can also serve as a strong mask generator, and the convolutional CLIP generalizes well to a larger input resolution than the one used during contrastive image-text pretraining. When training on COCO panoptic data only and testing in a zero-shot manner, FC-CLIP achieve 26.8 PQ, 16.8 AP, and 34.1 mIoU on ADE20K, 18.2 PQ, 27.9 mIoU on Mapillary Vistas, 44.0 PQ, 26.8 AP, 56.2 mIoU on Cityscapes, outperforming the prior art by +4.2 PQ, +2.4 AP, +4.2 mIoU on ADE20K, +4.0 PQ on Mapillary Vistas and +20.1 PQ on Cityscapes, respectively. Additionally, the training and testing time of FC-CLIP is 7.5x and 6.6x significantly faster than the same prior art, while using 5.9x fewer parameters. FC-CLIP also sets a new state-of-the-art performance across various open-vocabulary semantic segmentation datasets.

| **[Uncovering Prototypical Knowledge for Weakly Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19001v1)** | 2023-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the problem of weakly open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (WOVSS), which learns to segment objects of arbitrary classes using mere image-text pairs. Existing works turn to enhance the vanilla vision transformer by introducing explicit grouping recognition, i.e., employing several group tokens/centroids to cluster the image tokens and perform the group-text alignment. Nevertheless, these methods suffer from a granularity inconsistency regarding the usage of group tokens, which are aligned in the all-to-one v.s. one-to-one manners during the training and inference phases, respectively. We argue that this discrepancy arises from the lack of elaborate supervision for each group token. To bridge this granularity gap, this paper explores explicit supervision for the group tokens from the prototypical knowledge. To this end, this paper proposes the non-learnable prototypical regularization (NPR) where non-learnable prototypes are estimated from source features to serve as supervision and enable contrastive matching of the group tokens. This regularization encourages the group tokens to segment objects with less redundancy and capture more comprehensive semantic regions, leading to increased compactness and richness. Based on NPR, we propose the prototypical guidance segmentation network (PGSeg) that incorporates multi-modal regularization by leveraging prototypical sources from both images and texts at different levels, progressively enhancing the segmentation capability with diverse prototypical patterns. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

While significant progress has been made in object-level Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS), i.e., segmenting objects with arbitrary text, the corresponding part-level research poses additional challenges. Firstly, part segmentation inherently involves intricate boundaries, while limited annotated data compounds the challenge. Secondly, part segmentation introduces an open granularity challenge due to the diverse and often ambiguous definitions of parts in the open world. Furthermore, the large-scale vision and language models, which play a key role in the open vocabulary setting, struggle to recognize parts as effectively as objects. To comprehensively investigate and tackle these challenges, we propose an Open-Vocabulary Part Segmentation (OV-PARTS) benchmark. OV-PARTS includes refined versions of two publicly available datasets: Pascal-Part-116 and ADE20K-Part-234. And it covers three specific tasks: Generalized Zero-Shot Part Segmentation, Cross-Dataset Part Segmentation, and Few-Shot Part Segmentation, providing insights into analogical reasoning, open granularity and few-shot adapting abilities of models. Moreover, we analyze and adapt two prevailing paradigms of existing object-level OVSS methods for OV-PARTS. Extensive experimental analysis is conducted to inspire future research in leveraging foundational models for OV-PARTS.

| **[Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Decoupled One-Pass Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01198v2)** | 2023-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the open-vocabulary semantic segmentation problem has attracted increasing attention and the best performing methods are based on two-stream networks: one stream for proposal mask generation and the other for segment classification using a pretrained visual-language model. However, existing two-stream methods require passing a great number of (up to a hundred) image crops into the visual-language model, which is highly inefficient. To address the problem, we propose a network that only needs a single pass through the visual-language model for each input image. Specifically, we first propose a novel network adaptation approach, termed patch severance, to restrict the harmful interference between the patch embeddings in the pre-trained visual encoder. We then propose classification anchor learning to encourage the network to spatially focus on more discriminative features for classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods while being 4 to 7 times faster at inference.

| **[Global Knowledge Calibration for Fast Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09181v2)** | 2023-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, have enabled the segmentation of arbitrary concepts solely from textual inputs, a process commonly referred to as open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS). However, existing OVS techniques confront a fundamental challenge: the trained classifier tends to overfit on the base classes observed during training, resulting in suboptimal generalization performance to unseen classes. To mitigate this issue, recent studies have proposed the use of an additional frozen pre-trained CLIP for classification. Nonetheless, this approach incurs heavy computational overheads as the CLIP vision encoder must be repeatedly forward-passed for each mask, rendering it impractical for real-world applications. To address this challenge, our objective is to develop a fast OVS model that can perform comparably or better without the extra computational burden of the CLIP image encoder during inference. To this end, we propose a core idea of preserving the generalizable representation when fine-tuning on known classes. Specifically, we introduce a text diversification strategy that generates a set of synonyms for each training category, which prevents the learned representation from collapsing onto specific known category names. Additionally, we employ a text-guided knowledge distillation method to preserve the generalizable knowledge of CLIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves robust generalization performance across various datasets. Furthermore, we perform a preliminary exploration of open-vocabulary video segmentation and present a benchmark that can facilitate future open-vocabulary research in the video domain.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2023 |

The pre-trained model can capture enriched visual concepts for images by learning from a large scale of text-image data. However, transferring the learned visual knowledge to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a CLIP-based model named SegCLIP for the topic of open-vocabulary segmentation in an annotation-free manner. The SegCLIP achieves segmentation based on ViT and the main idea is to gather patches with learnable centers to semantic regions through training on text-image pairs. The gathering operation can dynamically capture the semantic groups, which can be used to generate the final segmentation results. We further propose a reconstruction loss on masked patches and a superpixel-based KL loss with pseudo-labels to enhance the visual representation. Experimental results show that our model achieves comparable or superior segmentation accuracy on the PASCAL VOC 2012 (+0.3% mIoU), PASCAL Context (+2.3% mIoU), and COCO (+2.2% mIoU) compared with baselines.

However, existing approaches often rely on expensive human annotations as supervision for model training, limiting their scalability to large, unlabeled datasets. To address this challenge, we present ZeroSeg, a novel method that leverages the existing pretrained vision-language (VL) model (e.g. CLIP) to train open-vocabulary zero-shot semantic segmentation models. Although acquired extensive knowledge of visual concepts, it is non-trivial to exploit knowledge from these VL models to the task of semantic segmentation, as they are usually trained at an image level. ZeroSeg overcomes this by distilling the visual concepts learned by VL models into a set of segment tokens, each summarizing a localized region of the target image. We evaluate ZeroSeg on multiple popular segmentation benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO, in a zero-shot manner (i.e., no training or adaption on target segmentation datasets). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared to other zero-shot segmentation methods under the same training data, while also performing competitively compared to strongly supervised methods. Finally, we also demonstrated the effectiveness of ZeroSeg on open-vocabulary segmentation, through both human studies and qualitative visualizations.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we first demonstrate the necessity of image-pixel CLIP feature adaption, then provide Multi-View Prompt learning (MVP-SEG) as an effective solution to achieve image-pixel adaptation and to solve open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Concretely, MVP-SEG deliberately learns multiple prompts trained by our Orthogonal Constraint Loss (OCLoss), by which each prompt is supervised to exploit CLIP feature on different object parts, and collaborative segmentation masks generated by all prompts promote better segmentation. Moreover, MVP-SEG introduces Global Prompt Refining (GPR) to further eliminate class-wise segmentation noise. Experiments show that the multi-view prompts learned from seen categories have strong generalization to unseen categories, and MVP-SEG+ which combines the knowledge transfer stage significantly outperforms previous methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, qualitative results justify that MVP-SEG does lead to better focus on different local parts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Mask-adapted CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04150v3)** | 2023-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to segment an image into semantic regions according to text descriptions, which may not have been seen during training. Recent two-stage methods first generate class-agnostic mask proposals and then leverage pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, to classify masked regions. We identify the performance bottleneck of this paradigm to be the pre-trained CLIP model, since it does not perform well on masked images. To address this, we propose to finetune CLIP on a collection of masked image regions and their corresponding text descriptions. We collect training data by mining an existing image-caption dataset (e.g., COCO Captions), using CLIP to match masked image regions to nouns in the image captions. Compared with the more precise and manually annotated segmentation labels with fixed classes (e.g., COCO-Stuff), we find our noisy but diverse dataset can better retain CLIP's generalization ability. Along with finetuning the entire model, we utilize the "blank" areas in masked images using a method we dub mask prompt tuning. Experiments demonstrate mask prompt tuning brings significant improvement without modifying any weights of CLIP, and it can further improve a fully finetuned model. In particular, when trained on COCO and evaluated on ADE20K-150, our best model achieves 29.6% mIoU, which is +8.5% higher than the previous state-of-the-art.

| **[Side Adapter Network for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12242v2)** | 2023-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a new framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with the pre-trained vision-language model, named Side Adapter Network (SAN). Our approach models the semantic segmentation task as a region recognition problem. A side network is attached to a frozen CLIP model with two branches: one for predicting mask proposals, and the other for predicting attention bias which is applied in the CLIP model to recognize the class of masks. This decoupled design has the benefit CLIP in recognizing the class of mask proposals. Since the attached side network can reuse CLIP features, it can be very light. In addition, the entire network can be trained end-to-end, allowing the side network to be adapted to the frozen CLIP model, which makes the predicted mask proposals CLIP-aware. Our approach is fast, accurate, and only adds a few additional trainable parameters. We evaluate our approach on multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our method significantly outperforms other counterparts, with up to 18 times fewer trainable parameters and 19 times faster inference speed. We hope our approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. The code will be available at https://github.com/MendelXu/SAN.</p></details> | CVPR2023 Highlight |
| **[Learning Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation Models From Natural Language Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09121v2)** | 2023-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider the problem of open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS), which aims to segment objects of arbitrary classes instead of pre-defined, closed-set categories. The main contributions are as follows: First, we propose a transformer-based model for OVS, termed as OVSegmentor, which only exploits web-crawled image-text pairs for pre-training without using any mask annotations. OVSegmentor assembles the image pixels into a set of learnable group tokens via a slot-attention based binding module, and aligns the group tokens to the corresponding caption embedding. Second, we propose two proxy tasks for training, namely masked entity completion and cross-image mask consistency. The former aims to infer all masked entities in the caption given the group tokens, that enables the model to learn fine-grained alignment between visual groups and text entities. The latter enforces consistent mask predictions between images that contain shared entities, which encourages the model to learn visual invariance. Third, we construct CC4M dataset for pre-training by filtering CC12M with frequently appeared entities, which significantly improves training efficiency. Fourth, we perform zero-shot transfer on three benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object. Our model achieves superior segmentation results over the state-of-the-art method by using only 3\% data (4M vs 134M) for pre-training. Code and pre-trained models will be released for future research.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2023 |
| **[A Language-Guided Benchmark for Weakly Supervised Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14163v1)** | 2023-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasing attention is being diverted to data-efficient problem settings like Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) which deals with segmenting an arbitrary object that may or may not be seen during training. The closest standard problems related to OVSS are Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Segmentation (ZSS, FSS) and their Cross-dataset variants where zero to few annotations are needed to segment novel classes. The existing FSS and ZSS methods utilize fully supervised pixel-labelled seen classes to segment unseen classes. Pixel-level labels are hard to obtain, and using weak supervision in the form of inexpensive image-level labels is often more practical. To this end, we propose a novel unified weakly supervised OVSS pipeline that can perform ZSS, FSS and Cross-dataset segmentation on novel classes without using pixel-level labels for either the base (seen) or the novel (unseen) classes in an inductive setting. We propose Weakly-Supervised Language-Guided Segmentation Network (WLSegNet), a novel language-guided segmentation pipeline that i) learns generalizable context vectors with batch aggregates (mean) to map class prompts to image features using frozen CLIP (a vision-language model) and ii) decouples weak ZSS/FSS into weak semantic segmentation and Zero-Shot segmentation. The learned context vectors avoid overfitting on seen classes during training and transfer better to novel classes during testing. WLSegNet avoids fine-tuning and the use of external datasets during training. The proposed pipeline beats existing methods for weak generalized Zero-Shot and weak Few-Shot semantic segmentation by 39 and 3 mIOU points respectively on PASCAL VOC and weak Few-Shot semantic segmentation by 5 mIOU points on MS COCO. On a harder setting of 2-way 1-shot weak FSS, WLSegNet beats the baselines by 13 and 22 mIOU points on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class Enhancement Losses with Pseudo Labels for Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07336v1)** | 2023-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent mask proposal models have significantly improved the performance of zero-shot semantic segmentation. However, the use of a `background' embedding during training in these methods is problematic as the resulting model tends to over-learn and assign all unseen classes as the background class instead of their correct labels. Furthermore, they ignore the semantic relationship of text embeddings, which arguably can be highly informative for zero-shot prediction as seen classes may have close relationship with unseen classes. To this end, this paper proposes novel class enhancement losses to bypass the use of the background embbedding during training, and simultaneously exploit the semantic relationship between text embeddings and mask proposals by ranking the similarity scores. To further capture the relationship between seen and unseen classes, we propose an effective pseudo label generation pipeline using pretrained vision-language model. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our method achieves overall the best performance for zero-shot semantic segmentation. Our method is flexible, and can also be applied to the challenging open-vocabulary semantic segmentation problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Baseline for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Pre-trained Vision-language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14757v2)** | 2022-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, open-vocabulary image classification by vision language pre-training has demonstrated incredible achievements, that the model can classify arbitrary categories without seeing additional annotated images of that category. However, it is still unclear how to make the open-vocabulary recognition work well on broader vision problems. This paper targets open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by building it on an off-the-shelf pre-trained vision-language model, i.e., CLIP. However, semantic segmentation and the CLIP model perform on different visual granularity, that semantic segmentation processes on pixels while CLIP performs on images. To remedy the discrepancy in processing granularity, we refuse the use of the prevalent one-stage FCN based framework, and advocate a two-stage semantic segmentation framework, with the first stage extracting generalizable mask proposals and the second stage leveraging an image based CLIP model to perform open-vocabulary classification on the masked image crops which are generated in the first stage. Our experimental results show that this two-stage framework can achieve superior performance than FCN when trained only on COCO Stuff dataset and evaluated on other datasets without fine-tuning. Moreover, this simple framework also surpasses previous state-of-the-arts of zero-shot semantic segmentation by a large margin: +29.5 hIoU on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset, and +8.9 hIoU on the COCO Stuff dataset. With its simplicity and strong performance, we hope this framework to serve as a baseline to facilitate future research. The code are made publicly available at~\url{https://github.com/MendelXu/zsseg.baseline}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Patch Aligned Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04994v1)** | 2022-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Patch Aligned Contrastive Learning (PACL), a modified compatibility function for CLIP's contrastive loss, intending to train an alignment between the patch tokens of the vision encoder and the CLS token of the text encoder. With such an alignment, a model can identify regions of an image corresponding to a given text input, and therefore transfer seamlessly to the task of open vocabulary semantic segmentation without requiring any segmentation annotations during training. Using pre-trained CLIP encoders with PACL, we are able to set the state-of-the-art on the task of open vocabulary zero-shot segmentation on 4 different segmentation benchmarks: Pascal VOC, Pascal Context, COCO Stuff and ADE20K. Furthermore, we show that PACL is also applicable to image-level predictions and when used with a CLIP backbone, provides a general improvement in zero-shot classification accuracy compared to CLIP, across a suite of 12 image classification datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate simple, yet effective approaches for adapting the pre-trained foundation models to the downstream task of interest, namely, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) we introduce Fusioner, with a lightweight, transformer-based fusion module, that pairs the frozen visual representation with language concept through a handful of image segmentation data. As a consequence, the model gains the capability of zero-shot transfer to segment novel categories; (ii) without loss of generality, we experiment on a broad range of self-supervised models that have been pre-trained with different schemes, e.g. visual-only models (MoCo v3, DINO), language-only models (BERT), visual-language model (CLIP), and show that, the proposed fusion approach is effective to any pair of visual and language models, even those pre-trained on a corpus of uni-modal data; (iii) we conduct thorough ablation studies to analyze the critical components in our proposed Fusioner, while evaluating on standard benchmarks, e.g. PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i , it surpasses existing state-of-the-art models by a large margin, despite only being trained on frozen visual and language features; (iv) to measure the model's robustness on learning visual-language correspondence, we further evaluate on synthetic dataset, named Mosaic-4, where images are constructed by mosaicking the samples from FSS-1000. Fusioner demonstrates superior performance over previous models.</p></details> | BMVC 2022 Oral |

Traditional methods like geometric algorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning often face issues with noise, limited generalization, and loss of geometric details. We propose FloorSAM, a framework that integrates point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for accurate floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data. Using grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement, we create robust top-down density maps. FloorSAM uses SAM's zero-shot learning for precise room segmentation, improving reconstruction across diverse layouts. Room masks are generated via adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering, followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and regularization. This produces accurate floor plans and recovers room topological relationships. Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets show better accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially in noisy and complex settings.

| **[Re-purposing SAM into Efficient Visual Projectors for MLLM-Based Referring Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13676v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) frameworks that pair the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have achieved impressive results. However, adapting MLLM to segmentation is computationally intensive, primarily due to visual token redundancy. We observe that traditional patch-wise visual projectors struggle to strike a balance between reducing the number of visual tokens and preserving semantic clarity, often retaining overly long token sequences to avoid performance drops. Inspired by text tokenizers, we propose a novel semantic visual projector that leverages semantic superpixels generated by SAM to identify "visual words" in an image. By compressing and projecting semantic superpixels as visual tokens, our approach adaptively shortens the token sequence according to scene complexity while minimizing semantic loss in compression. To mitigate loss of information, we propose a semantic superpixel positional embedding to strengthen MLLM's awareness of superpixel geometry and position, alongside a semantic superpixel aggregator to preserve both fine-grained details inside superpixels and global context outside. Experiments show that our method cuts visual tokens by 93% without compromising performance, notably speeding up MLLM training and inference, and outperforming existing compressive visual projectors on RIS.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAMIR, an efficient registration framework via robust feature learning from SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13629v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis. Deformations are often closely related to the morphological characteristics of tissues, making accurate feature extraction crucial. Recent weakly supervised methods improve registration by incorporating anatomical priors such as segmentation masks or landmarks, either as inputs or in the loss function. However, such weak labels are often not readily available, limiting their practical use. Motivated by the strong representation learning ability of visual foundation models, this paper introduces SAMIR, an efficient medical image registration framework that utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance feature extraction. SAM is pretrained on large-scale natural image datasets and can learn robust, general-purpose visual representations. Rather than using raw input images, we design a task-specific adaptation pipeline using SAM's image encoder to extract structure-aware feature embeddings, enabling more accurate modeling of anatomical consistency and deformation patterns. We further design a lightweight 3D head to refine features within the embedding space, adapting to local deformations in medical images. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Feature Consistency Loss to guide coarse-to-fine feature matching and improve anatomical alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAMIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets for both intra-subject cardiac image registration and inter-subject abdomen CT image registration, achieving performance improvements of 2.68% on ACDC and 6.44% on the abdomen dataset. The source code will be publicly available on GitHub following the acceptance of this paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal SAM-adapter for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10408v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation, a key task in computer vision with broad applications in autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics, has advanced substantially with deep learning. Nevertheless, current approaches remain vulnerable to challenging conditions such as poor lighting, occlusions, and adverse weather. To address these limitations, multimodal methods that integrate auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have recently emerged, providing complementary information that enhances robustness. In this work, we present MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that extends the capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. The proposed method employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into SAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong generalization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating auxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM SAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We evaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES, where MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze modality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard subsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms competing methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding. The code is available at the following link: https://github.com/iacopo97/Multimodal-SAM-Adapter.</p></details> |  |
| **[SGDFuse: SAM-Guided Diffusion for High-Fidelity Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05264v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks. However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at https://github.com/boshizhang123/SGDFuse.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Information Fusion</p></details> |

This task can be performed using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability. However, foundational models often present a considerable number of non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization, limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$, that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces, and nanoscale features.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |
| **[EdgeSAM: Prompt-In-the-Loop Distillation for SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06660v3)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents EdgeSAM, an accelerated variant of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), optimized for efficient execution on edge devices with minimal compromise in performance. Our approach involves distilling the original ViT-based SAM image encoder into a purely CNN-based architecture, better suited for edge devices. We carefully benchmark various distillation strategies and demonstrate that task-agnostic encoder distillation fails to capture the full knowledge embodied in SAM. To overcome this bottleneck, we include both the prompt encoder and mask decoder in the distillation process, with box and point prompts in the loop, so that the distilled model can accurately capture the intricate dynamics between user input and mask generation. To mitigate dataset bias issues stemming from point prompt distillation, we incorporate a lightweight module within the encoder. As a result, EdgeSAM achieves a 37-fold speed increase compared to the original SAM, and it also outperforms MobileSAM/EfficientSAM, being over 7 times as fast when deployed on edge devices while enhancing the mIoUs on COCO and LVIS by 2.3/1.5 and 3.1/1.6, respectively. It is also the first SAM variant that can run at over 30 FPS on an iPhone 14.

However, these models struggle in adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging, where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases, we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter (UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts. We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets. Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather, while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Repurposing SAM for User-Defined Semantics Aware Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02420v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) excels at generating precise object masks from input prompts but lacks semantic awareness, failing to associate its generated masks with specific object categories. To address this limitation, we propose U-SAM, a novel framework that imbibes semantic awareness into SAM, enabling it to generate targeted masks for user-specified object categories. Given only object class names as input from the user, U-SAM provides pixel-level semantic annotations for images without requiring any labeled/unlabeled samples from the test data distribution. Our approach leverages synthetically generated or web crawled images to accumulate semantic information about the desired object classes. We then learn a mapping function between SAM's mask embeddings and object class labels, effectively enhancing SAM with granularity-specific semantic recognition capabilities. As a result, users can obtain meaningful and targeted segmentation masks for specific objects they request, rather than generic and unlabeled masks. We evaluate U-SAM on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MSCOCO-80, achieving significant mIoU improvements of +17.95% and +5.20%, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods. By transforming SAM into a semantically aware segmentation model, U-SAM offers a practical and flexible solution for pixel-level annotation across diverse and unseen domains in a resource-constrained environment.</p></details> |  |

A critical challenge arises from the domain gap between natural images and medical volumes: existing FMs, pre-trained on 2D data, struggle to capture 3D anatomical context, limiting their utility in clinical applications like tumor segmentation. To address this, we propose an adaptation framework called TAGS: Tumor Adaptive Guidance for SAM, which unlocks 2D FMs for 3D medical tasks through multi-prompt fusion. By preserving most of the pre-trained weights, our approach enhances SAM's spatial feature extraction using CLIP's semantic insights and anatomy-specific prompts. Extensive experiments on three open-source tumor segmentation datasets prove that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models (+46.88% over nnUNet), interactive segmentation frameworks, and other established medical FMs, including SAM-Med2D, SAM-Med3D, SegVol, Universal, 3D-Adapter, and SAM-B (at least +13% over them).

Leveraging such unprecedented data diversity, they exhibit strong open-world segmentation capabilities, with SAM~2 further enhancing these capabilities to support high-quality video segmentation. While SAMs (SAM and SAM~2) have demonstrated excellent performance in segmenting context-independent concepts like people, cars, and roads, they overlook more challenging context-dependent (CD) concepts, such as visual saliency, camouflage, industrial defects, and medical lesions. CD concepts rely heavily on global and local contextual information, making them susceptible to shifts in different contexts, which requires strong discriminative capabilities from the model. The lack of comprehensive evaluation of SAMs limits understanding of their performance boundaries, which may hinder the design of future models. In this paper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of SAMs on 11 CD concepts across 2D and 3D images and videos in various visual modalities within natural, medical, and industrial scenes. We develop a unified evaluation framework for SAM and SAM~2 that supports manual, automatic, and intermediate self-prompting, aided by our specific prompt generation and interaction strategies. We further explore the potential of SAM~2 for in-context learning and introduce prompt robustness testing to simulate real-world imperfect prompts. Finally, we analyze the benefits and limitations of SAMs in understanding CD concepts and discuss their future development in segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission to International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)</p></details> |

To overcome these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image), (ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\% vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability, and interpretability, E-BayesSAM bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs, advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications.

This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods: prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, accepted by Journal of Medical Imaging</p></details> |
| **[GeoSAM: Fine-tuning SAM with Multi-Modal Prompts for Mobility Infrastructure Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11319v4)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In geographical image segmentation, performance is often constrained by the limited availability of training data and a lack of generalizability, particularly for segmenting mobility infrastructure such as roads, sidewalks, and crosswalks. Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pre-trained on millions of natural images, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot segmentation performance, providing a potential solution. However, SAM struggles with geographical images, such as aerial and satellite imagery, due to its training being confined to natural images and the narrow features and textures of these objects blending into their surroundings. To address these challenges, we propose Geographical SAM (GeoSAM), a SAM-based framework that fine-tunes SAM using automatically generated multi-modal prompts. Specifically, GeoSAM integrates point prompts from a pre-trained task-specific model as primary visual guidance, and text prompts generated by a large language model as secondary semantic guidance, enabling the model to better capture both spatial structure and contextual meaning. GeoSAM outperforms existing approaches for mobility infrastructure segmentation in both familiar and completely unseen regions by at least 5\% in mIoU, representing a significant leap in leveraging foundation models to segment mobility infrastructure, including both road and pedestrian infrastructure in geographical images.

| **[Adapting SAM via Cross-Entropy Masking for Class Imbalance in Remote Sensing Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10568v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational models have achieved significant success in diverse domains of computer vision. They learn general representations that are easily transferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is Segment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images. We propose adapting the SAM encoder via fine-tuning for remote sensing change detection (RSCD) along with spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) and multi-scale decoder fusion (MSDF) to detect changes robustly at multiple scales. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss to handle high class imbalance in change detection datasets. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four change detection datasets, Levir-CD, WHU-CD, CLCD, and S2Looking. We achieved 2.5% F1-score improvement on a large complex S2Looking dataset. The code is available at: https://github.com/humza909/SAM-CEM-CD</p></details> | work in progress |

Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However, VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously. Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers, achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective, optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and indicator measurements.

The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown great effectiveness across various video segmentation tasks. However, its application to offline RVOS is challenged by the translation of the text into effective prompts and a lack of global context awareness. In this paper, we propose a novel RVOS framework, termed MPG-SAM 2, to address these challenges. Specifically, MPG-SAM 2 employs a unified multimodal encoder to jointly encode video and textual features, generating semantically aligned video and text embeddings, along with multimodal class tokens. A mask prior generator utilizes the video embeddings and class tokens to create pseudo masks of target objects and global context. These masks are fed into the prompt encoder as dense prompts along with multimodal class tokens as sparse prompts to generate accurate prompts for SAM 2. To provide the online SAM 2 with a global view, we introduce a hierarchical global-historical aggregator, which allows SAM 2 to aggregate global and historical information of target objects at both pixel and object levels, enhancing the target representation and temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on several RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MPG-SAM 2 and the effectiveness of our proposed modules. The code is available at https://github.com/rongfu-dsb/MPG-SAM2.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[SAM Encoder Breach by Adversarial Simplicial Complex Triggers Downstream Model Failures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06127v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications. Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative. Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex. Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,recived by ICCV2025</p></details> |
| **[Segment Any Vehicle: Semantic and Visual Context Driven SAM and A Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04260v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception, particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge. Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. % Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released upon acceptance. Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/SAV</p></details> |  |
| **[BrainSegDMlF: A Dynamic Fusion-enhanced SAM for Brain Lesion Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06133v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The segmentation of substantial brain lesions is a significant and challenging task in the field of medical image segmentation. Substantial brain lesions in brain imaging exhibit high heterogeneity, with indistinct boundaries between lesion regions and normal brain tissue. Small lesions in single slices are difficult to identify, making the accurate and reproducible segmentation of abnormal regions, as well as their feature description, highly complex. Existing methods have the following limitations: 1) They rely solely on single-modal information for learning, neglecting the multi-modal information commonly used in diagnosis. This hampers the ability to comprehensively acquire brain lesion information from multiple perspectives and prevents the effective integration and utilization of multi-modal data inputs, thereby limiting a holistic understanding of lesions. 2) They are constrained by the amount of data available, leading to low sensitivity to small lesions and difficulty in detecting subtle pathological changes. 3) Current SAM-based models rely on external prompts, which cannot achieve automatic segmentation and, to some extent, affect diagnostic efficiency.To address these issues, we have developed a large-scale fully automated segmentation model specifically designed for brain lesion segmentation, named BrainSegDMLF. This model has the following features: 1) Dynamic Modal Interactive Fusion (DMIF) module that processes and integrates multi-modal data during the encoding process, providing the SAM encoder with more comprehensive modal information. 2) Layer-by-Layer Upsampling Decoder, enabling the model to extract rich low-level and high-level features even with limited data, thereby detecting the presence of small lesions. 3) Automatic segmentation masks, allowing the model to generate lesion masks automatically without requiring manual prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProSAM: Enhancing the Robustness of SAM-based Visual Reference Segmentation with Probabilistic Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21835v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes, texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts at boundaries of target regions due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[SAM-PTx: Text-Guided Fine-Tuning of SAM with Parameter-Efficient, Parallel-Text Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00213v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we present SAM(a Stability-Aware Manager), an autonomic cache manager that establishes decision stability as a first-class design principle. It achieves this through its core control policy, AURA(Autonomic Utility-balancing Resource Allocator), which resolves the classic exploitation-exploration dilemma by synthesizing two orthogonal factors: the H-factor, representing proven historical efficiency (exploitation), and the V-factor, for estimated marginal gain (exploration). Through this practical synthesis and adaptive control, SAM achieves sustained high performance with strategic stability and robustness in volatile conditions. Extensive experiments against 14 diverse baselines demonstrate SAM's superiority. It achieves top-tier throughput while being uniquely resilient to complex workload shifts and adversarial workloads like cache pollution. Furthermore, its decision latency is highly scalable, remaining nearly constant as the system grows to 120 databases. Crucially, SAM achieves superior decision stability -- maintaining consistent optimization directions despite noise, avoiding performance oscillations while ensuring predictable Quality of Service. These results prove that a principled, stability-aware design is essential for sustained high performance in real-world, large-scale systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures.

However, existing SSCOD methods based on Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically, ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training. Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient SSCOD.

However, the speckle noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight, text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas, TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation, TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS segmentation.

| **[SAM2Long: Enhancing SAM 2 for Long Video Segmentation with a Training-Free Memory Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16268v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has emerged as a powerful foundation model for object segmentation in both images and videos, paving the way for various downstream video applications. The crucial design of SAM 2 for video segmentation is its memory module, which prompts object-aware memories from previous frames for current frame prediction. However, its greedy-selection memory design suffers from the "error accumulation" problem, where an errored or missed mask will cascade and influence the segmentation of the subsequent frames, which limits the performance of SAM 2 toward complex long-term videos. To this end, we introduce SAM2Long, an improved training-free video object segmentation strategy, which considers the segmentation uncertainty within each frame and chooses the video-level optimal results from multiple segmentation pathways in a constrained tree search manner. In practice, we maintain a fixed number of segmentation pathways throughout the video. For each frame, multiple masks are proposed based on the existing pathways, creating various candidate branches. We then select the same fixed number of branches with higher cumulative scores as the new pathways for the next frame. After processing the final frame, the pathway with the highest cumulative score is chosen as the final segmentation result. Benefiting from its heuristic search design, SAM2Long is robust toward occlusions and object reappearances, and can effectively segment and track objects for complex long-term videos. Notably, SAM2Long achieves an average improvement of 3.0 points across all 24 head-to-head comparisons, with gains of up to 5.3 points in J&F on long-term video object segmentation benchmarks such as SA-V and LVOS.

| **[Fully Automated SAM for Single-source Domain Generalization in Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17281v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although SAM-based single-source domain generalization models for medical image segmentation can mitigate the impact of domain shift on the model in cross-domain scenarios, these models still face two major challenges. First, the segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated prompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image segmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second, providing poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large) to the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask results. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain generalization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully automated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted Generation Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty Modeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module integrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty distribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding box prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with SAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image embeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the target object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts. Extensive experiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate the effectiveness of FA-SAM and highlight its potential to address the above challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for presentation at the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (IEEE SMC 2025) and is copyrighted by IEEE</p></details> |

Recent foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization capability in general segmentation tasks, making it a promising solution for few-shot scenarios. However, adapting SAM to CD-FSS faces two critical challenges: reliance on manual prompt and limited cross-domain ability. Therefore, we propose the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework that introduces three key modules: (i) the Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for semantic expansion, (ii) the Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) module for automated meta-prompt synthesis, and (iii) the Frequency-Aware Interaction (FAI) module for domain discrepancy mitigation. Evaluations across four cross-domain datasets demonstrate CMP's state-of-the-art performance, achieving 71.8\% and 74.5\% mIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios respectively.</p></details> | 3 figures |

Additionally, reliance on large-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and error-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong generalizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts, effectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since manually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and time-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework based on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated image, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional annotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation (CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to adapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead of dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for iterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality. Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness. Notably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 11.44%.</p></details> | accepted by ICCV2025 |

To harness the vast pool of unlabeled remote sensing data, we propose SAMST, a semi-supervised semantic segmentation method. SAMST leverages the strengths of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in zero-shot generalization and boundary detection. SAMST iteratively refines pseudo-labels through two main components: supervised model self-training using both labeled and pseudo-labeled data, and a SAM-based Pseudo-label Refiner. The Pseudo-label Refiner comprises three modules: a Threshold Filter Module for preprocessing, a Prompt Generation Module for extracting connected regions and generating prompts for SAM, and a Label Refinement Module for final label stitching. By integrating the generalization power of large models with the training efficiency of small models, SAMST improves pseudo-label accuracy, thereby enhancing overall model performance. Experiments on the Potsdam dataset validate the effectiveness and feasibility of SAMST, demonstrating its potential to address the challenges posed by limited labeled data in remote sensing semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>IGARS...</summary><p>IGARSS2025 accepted, Correspondence: fujianhai2024@gmail.com (J.F.), cuichj@mail2.sysu.edu.cn (C.C.)</p></details> |

While psychological explanations such as the ideomotor effect exist, a computational understanding of how decentralized, implicit linguistic knowledge fuses through shared physical interaction remains elusive. We introduce CoCre-Sam (Collective-Creature Sampling), a framework modeling this phenomenon as collective Langevin dynamics sampling from implicitly fused language models. Each participant is represented as an agent associated with an energy landscape derived from an internal language model reflecting linguistic priors, and agents exert stochastic forces based on local energy gradients. We theoretically prove that the collective motion of the shared pointer (planchette) corresponds to Langevin MCMC sampling from the sum of individual energy landscapes, representing fused collective knowledge. Simulations validate that CoCre-Sam dynamics effectively fuse different models and generate meaningful character sequences, while ablation studies confirm the essential roles of collective interaction and stochasticity. Altogether, CoCre-Sam provides a novel computational mechanism linking individual implicit knowledge, embodied collective action, and emergent linguistic phenomena, grounding these complex interactions in the principles of probabilistic sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compress Any Segment Anything Model (SAM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08765v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing. Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning, distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model, and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio, post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished within 60 seconds for all models.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 tables, 8 figures</p></details> |

The recent segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated strong adaptability across diverse natural scenarios. However, the huge computational costs, demand for manual annotations as prompts and conflict-prone decoding process of SAM degrade its generalization capabilities in medical scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a modality-decoupled lightweight SAM for domain-generalized medical image segmentation, named De-LightSAM. Specifically, we first devise a lightweight domain-controllable image encoder (DC-Encoder) that produces discriminative visual features for diverse modalities. Further, we introduce the self-patch prompt generator (SP-Generator) to automatically generate high-quality dense prompt embeddings for guiding segmentation decoding. Finally, we design the query-decoupled modality decoder (QM-Decoder) that leverages a one-to-one strategy to provide an independent decoding channel for every modality, preventing mutual knowledge interference of different modalities. Moreover, we design a multi-modal decoupled knowledge distillation (MDKD) strategy to leverage robust common knowledge to complement domain-specific medical feature representations. Extensive experiments indicate that De-LightSAM outperforms state-of-the-arts in diverse medical imaging segmentation tasks, displaying superior modality universality and generalization capabilities. Especially, De-LightSAM uses only 2.0% parameters compared to SAM-H. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/De-LightSAM.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, 2D specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy, non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18 backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment.

However, accurately segmenting vessels remains challenging due to their small size, intricate edge structures, and susceptibility to artifacts and imaging noise. In this work, we propose VesselSAM, an enhanced version of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), specifically tailored for aortic vessel segmentation. VesselSAM incorporates AtrousLoRA, a novel module integrating Atrous Attention and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance segmentation performance. Atrous Attention enables the model to capture multi-scale contextual information, preserving both fine-grained local details and broader global context. Additionally, LoRA facilitates efficient fine-tuning of the frozen SAM image encoder, reducing the number of trainable parameters and thereby enhancing computational efficiency. We evaluate VesselSAM using two challenging datasets: the Aortic Vessel Tree (AVT) dataset and the Type-B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) dataset. VesselSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining DSC scores of 93.50\%, 93.25\%, 93.02\%, and 93.26\% across multi-center datasets. Our results demonstrate that VesselSAM delivers high segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to existing large-scale models.

| **[SRPL-SFDA: SAM-Guided Reliable Pseudo-Labels for Source-Free Domain Adaptation in Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09403v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain Adaptation (DA) is crucial for robust deployment of medical image segmentation models when applied to new clinical centers with significant domain shifts. Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is appealing as it can deal with privacy concerns and access constraints on source-domain data during adaptation to target-domain data. However, SFDA faces challenges such as insufficient supervision in the target domain with unlabeled images. In this work, we propose a Segment Anything Model (SAM)-guided Reliable Pseudo-Labels method for SFDA (SRPL-SFDA) with three key components: 1) Test-Time Tri-branch Intensity Enhancement (T3IE) that not only improves quality of raw pseudo-labels in the target domain, but also leads to SAM-compatible inputs with three channels to better leverage SAM's zero-shot inference ability for refining the pseudo-labels; 2) A reliable pseudo-label selection module that rejects low-quality pseudo-labels based on Consistency of Multiple SAM Outputs (CMSO) under input perturbations with T3IE; and 3) A reliability-aware training procedure in the unlabeled target domain where reliable pseudo-labels are used for supervision and unreliable parts are regularized by entropy minimization. Experiments conducted on two multi-domain medical image segmentation datasets for fetal brain and the prostate respectively demonstrate that: 1) SRPL-SFDA effectively enhances pseudo-label quality in the unlabeled target domain, and improves SFDA performance by leveraging the reliability-aware training; 2) SRPL-SFDA outperformed state-of-the-art SFDA methods, and its performance is close to that of supervised training in the target domain. The code of this work is available online: https://github.com/HiLab-git/SRPL-SFDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures.

| **[SAM-aware Test-time Adaptation for Universal Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05221v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains. Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs. ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1) Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image segmentation.

Current monitoring methods involve ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2) temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM) information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations. We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree crown instance segmentation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Self-Prompting SAM: A Prompt-Free Medical Image Segmentation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02854v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is highly effective in natural image segmentation, it requires dependencies on prompts, which limits its applicability to medical imaging where manual prompts are often unavailable. Existing efforts to fine-tune SAM for medical segmentation typically struggle to remove this dependency. We propose Hierarchical Self-Prompting SAM (HSP-SAM), a novel self-prompting framework that enables SAM to achieve strong performance in prompt-free medical image segmentation. Unlike previous self-prompting methods that remain limited to positional prompts similar to vanilla SAM, we are the first to introduce learning abstract prompts during the self-prompting process. This simple and intuitive self-prompting framework achieves superior performance on classic segmentation tasks such as polyp and skin lesion segmentation, while maintaining robustness across diverse medical imaging modalities. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization to unseen datasets, achieving improvements of up to 14.04% over previous state-of-the-art methods on some challenging benchmarks. These results suggest that abstract prompts encapsulate richer and higher-dimensional semantic information compared to positional prompts, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and generalization performance. All models and codes will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, extending these capabilities to videos presents substantial challenges, particularly in ensuring precise and temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. SAM 2 attempts to address this by training a model on massive image and video data from scratch to learn complex spatiotemporal associations, resulting in huge training costs that hinder research and practical deployment. In this paper, we introduce SAM-I2V, an effective image-to-video upgradation method for cultivating a promptable video segmentation (PVS) model. Our approach strategically upgrades the pre-trained SAM to support PVS, significantly reducing training complexity and resource requirements. To achieve this, we introduce three key innovations: (i) an image-to-video feature extraction upgrader built upon SAM's static image encoder to enable spatiotemporal video perception, (ii) a memory filtering strategy that selects the most relevant past frames for more effective utilization of historical information, and (iii) a memory-as-prompt mechanism leveraging object memory to ensure temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves over 90% of SAM 2's performance while using only 0.2% of its training cost. Our work presents a resource-efficient pathway to PVS, lowering barriers for further research in PVS model design and enabling broader applications and advancements in the field.

To address this problem, semantic segmentation methods based on semi-supervised learning with a small number of labeled data have been proposed. For example, one approach is to train a semantic segmentation model using images with annotated labels and pseudo labels. In this approach, the accuracy of the semantic segmentation model depends on the quality of the pseudo labels, and the quality of the pseudo labels depends on the performance of the model to be trained and the amount of data with annotated labels. In this paper, we generate pseudo labels using zero-shot annotation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels using the Unified Dual-Stream Perturbations Approach (UniMatch), and use them as enhanced labels to train a semantic segmentation model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through the experiments using the public datasets: PASCAL and MS COCO.

However, existing approaches typically rely heavily on manually annotated datasets that include explicit reasoning processes, which are costly and time-consuming to produce. Recent advances suggest that reinforcement learning (RL) can endow large models with reasoning capabilities without requiring such reasoning-annotated data. In this paper, we propose SAM-R1, a novel framework that enables multimodal large models to perform fine-grained reasoning in image understanding tasks. Our approach is the first to incorporate fine-grained segmentation settings during the training of multimodal reasoning models. By integrating task-specific, fine-grained rewards with a tailored optimization objective, we further enhance the model's reasoning and segmentation alignment. We also leverage the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a strong and flexible reward provider to guide the learning process. With only 3k training samples, SAM-R1 achieves strong performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in equipping multimodal models with segmentation-oriented reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

In urology, manual segmentation is considered tedious and impractical due to the typically large scale of image databases and the continuous generation of new data. In this study, the potential of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) -- a state-of-the-art deep learning framework -- is investigated for the automation of kidney stone segmentation. The performance of SAM is evaluated in comparison to traditional models, including U-Net, Residual U-Net, and Attention U-Net, which, despite their efficiency, frequently exhibit limitations in generalizing to unseen datasets. The findings highlight SAM's superior adaptability and efficiency. While SAM achieves comparable performance to U-Net on in-distribution data (Accuracy: 97.68 + 3.04; Dice: 97.78 + 2.47; IoU: 95.76 + 4.18), it demonstrates significantly enhanced generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution data, surpassing all U-Net variants by margins of up to 23 percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, conference, MIUA25</p></details> |
| **[Auto-Prompting SAM for Weakly Supervised Landslide Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13426v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised landslide extraction aims to identify landslide regions from remote sensing data using models trained with weak labels, particularly image-level labels. However, it is often challenged by the imprecise boundaries of the extracted objects due to the lack of pixel-wise supervision and the properties of landslide objects. To tackle these issues, we propose a simple yet effective method by auto-prompting the Segment Anything Model (SAM), i.e., APSAM. Instead of depending on high-quality class activation maps (CAMs) for pseudo-labeling or fine-tuning SAM, our method directly yields fine-grained segmentation masks from SAM inference through prompt engineering. Specifically, it adaptively generates hybrid prompts from the CAMs obtained by an object localization network. To provide sufficient information for SAM prompting, an adaptive prompt generation (APG) algorithm is designed to fully leverage the visual patterns of CAMs, enabling the efficient generation of pseudo-masks for landslide extraction. These informative prompts are able to identify the extent of landslide areas (box prompts) and denote the centers of landslide objects (point prompts), guiding SAM in landslide segmentation. Experimental results on high-resolution aerial and satellite datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving improvements of at least 3.0\% in F1 score and 3.69\% in IoU compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The source codes and datasets will be available at https://github.com/zxk688.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Unlocking the Power of SAM 2 for Few-Shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14100v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) aims to learn class-agnostic segmentation on few classes to segment arbitrary classes, but at the risk of overfitting. To address this, some methods use the well-learned knowledge of foundation models (e.g., SAM) to simplify the learning process. Recently, SAM 2 has extended SAM by supporting video segmentation, whose class-agnostic matching ability is useful to FSS. A simple idea is to encode support foreground (FG) features as memory, with which query FG features are matched and fused. Unfortunately, the FG objects in different frames of SAM 2's video data are always the same identity, while those in FSS are different identities, i.e., the matching step is incompatible. Therefore, we design Pseudo Prompt Generator to encode pseudo query memory, matching with query features in a compatible way. However, the memories can never be as accurate as the real ones, i.e., they are likely to contain incomplete query FG, and some unexpected query background (BG) features, leading to wrong segmentation. Hence, we further design Iterative Memory Refinement to fuse more query FG features into the memory, and devise a Support-Calibrated Memory Attention to suppress the unexpected query BG features in memory. Extensive experiments have been conducted on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ to validate the effectiveness of our design, e.g., the 1-shot mIoU can be 4.2% better than the best baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICML'25</p></details> |
| **[Promoting SAM for Camouflaged Object Detection via Selective Key Point-based Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09123v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Big model has emerged as a new research paradigm that can be applied to various down-stream tasks with only minor effort for domain adaption. Correspondingly, this study tackles Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The previous studies declared that SAM is not workable for COD but this study reveals that SAM works if promoted properly, for which we devise a new framework to render point promotions: First, we develop the Promotion Point Targeting Network (PPT-net) to leverage multi-scale features in predicting the probabilities of camouflaged objects' presences at given candidate points over the image. Then, we develop a key point selection (KPS) algorithm to deploy both positive and negative point promotions contrastively to SAM to guide the segmentation. It is the first work to facilitate big model for COD and achieves plausible results experimentally over the existing methods on 3 data sets under 6 metrics. This study demonstrates an off-the-shelf methodology for COD by leveraging SAM, which gains advantage over designing professional models from scratch, not only in performance, but also in turning the problem to a less challenging task, that is, seeking informative but not exactly precise promotions.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we propose Proxy Prompt (PP), auto-generated by leveraging non-target data with a pre-annotated mask. We devise a novel 3-step context-selection strategy for adaptively selecting the most representative contextual information from non-target data via vision mamba and selective maps, empowering the guiding capability of non-target image-mask pairs for segmentation on target image/video data. To reinforce human-model interactions in PP, we further propose a contextual colorization module via a dual-reverse cross-attention to enhance interactions between target features and contextual-embedding with amplifying distinctive features of user-defined object(s). Via extensive evaluations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and yields comparable results with fully-trained models, even when trained with only 16 image masks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pro2SAM: Mask Prompt to SAM with Grid Points for Weakly Supervised Object Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04905v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL), which aims to localize objects by only using image-level labels, has attracted much attention because of its low annotation cost in real applications. Current studies focus on the Class Activation Map (CAM) of CNN and the self-attention map of transformer to identify the region of objects. However, both CAM and self-attention maps can not learn pixel-level fine-grained information on the foreground objects, which hinders the further advance of WSOL. To address this problem, we initiatively leverage the capability of zero-shot generalization and fine-grained segmentation in Segment Anything Model (SAM) to boost the activation of integral object regions. Further, to alleviate the semantic ambiguity issue accrued in single point prompt-based SAM, we propose an innovative mask prompt to SAM (Pro2SAM) network with grid points for WSOL task. First, we devise a Global Token Transformer (GTFormer) to generate a coarse-grained foreground map as a flexible mask prompt, where the GTFormer jointly embeds patch tokens and novel global tokens to learn foreground semantics. Secondly, we deliver grid points as dense prompts into SAM to maximize the probability of foreground mask, which avoids the lack of objects caused by a single point/box prompt. Finally, we propose a pixel-level similarity metric to come true the mask matching from mask prompt to SAM, where the mask with the highest score is viewed as the final localization map. Experiments show that the proposed Pro2SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC, with 84.03\% and 66.85\% Top-1 Loc, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Volumetric Medical Image Annotation via Short-Long Memory SAM 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01854v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manual annotation of volumetric medical images, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Recent advancements in foundation models for video object segmentation, such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), offer a potential opportunity to significantly speed up the annotation process by manually annotating one or a few slices and then propagating target masks across the entire volume. However, the performance of SAM 2 in this context varies. Our experiments show that relying on a single memory bank and attention module is prone to error propagation, particularly at boundary regions where the target is present in the previous slice but absent in the current one. To address this problem, we propose Short-Long Memory SAM 2 (SLM-SAM 2), a novel architecture that integrates distinct short-term and long-term memory banks with separate attention modules to improve segmentation accuracy. We evaluate SLM-SAM 2 on three public datasets covering organs, bones, and muscles across MRI and CT modalities. We show that the proposed method markedly outperforms the default SAM 2, achieving average Dice Similarity Coefficient improvement of 0.14 and 0.11 in the scenarios when 5 volumes and 1 volume are available for the initial adaptation, respectively. SLM-SAM 2 also exhibits stronger resistance to over-propagation, making a notable step toward more accurate automated annotation of medical images for segmentation model development.</p></details> |  |

However, its performance in the field of image manipulation detection remains largely unexplored and unconfirmed. There are two main challenges in applying SAM to image manipulation detection: a) reliance on manual prompts, and b) the difficulty of single-view information in supporting cross-dataset generalization. To address these challenges, we develops a cross-view prompt learning paradigm called IMDPrompter based on SAM. Benefiting from the design of automated prompts, IMDPrompter no longer relies on manual guidance, enabling automated detection and localization. Additionally, we propose components such as Cross-view Feature Perception, Optimal Prompt Selection, and Cross-View Prompt Consistency, which facilitate cross-view perceptual learning and guide SAM to generate accurate masks. Extensive experimental results from five datasets (CASIA, Columbia, Coverage, IMD2020, and NIST16) validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAM-Guided Robust Representation Learning for One-Shot 3D Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20501v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-shot medical image segmentation (MIS) is crucial for medical analysis due to the burden of medical experts on manual annotation. The recent emergence of the segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable adaptation in MIS but cannot be directly applied to one-shot medical image segmentation (MIS) due to its reliance on labor-intensive user interactions and the high computational cost. To cope with these limitations, we propose a novel SAM-guided robust representation learning framework, named RRL-MedSAM, to adapt SAM to one-shot 3D MIS, which exploits the strong generalization capabilities of the SAM encoder to learn better feature representation. We devise a dual-stage knowledge distillation (DSKD) strategy to distill general knowledge between natural and medical images from the foundation model to train a lightweight encoder, and then adopt a mutual exponential moving average (mutual-EMA) to update the weights of the general lightweight encoder and medical-specific encoder. Specifically, pseudo labels from the registration network are used to perform mutual supervision for such two encoders. Moreover, we introduce an auto-prompting (AP) segmentation decoder which adopts the mask generated from the general lightweight model as a prompt to assist the medical-specific model in boosting the final segmentation performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets, i.e., OASIS, CT-lung demonstrate that the proposed RRL-MedSAM outperforms state-of-the-art one-shot MIS methods for both segmentation and registration tasks. Especially, our lightweight encoder uses only 3\% of the parameters compared to the encoder of SAM-Base.</p></details> |  |

However, SAM's performance decreases substantially when applied to non-natural domains like microscopic imaging. Furthermore, due to SAM's interactive design, it requires a precise prompt for each image and object, which is unfeasible in many automated biomedical applications. Previous solutions adapt SAM by training millions of parameters via fine-tuning large parts of the model or of adapter layers. In contrast, we show that as little as 2,048 additional parameters are sufficient for turning SAM into a use-case specialist for a certain downstream task. Our novel PTSAM (prompt-tuned SAM) method uses prompt-tuning, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, to adapt SAM for a specific task. We validate the performance of our approach on multiple microscopic and one medical dataset. Our results show that prompt-tuning only SAM's mask decoder already leads to a performance on-par with state-of-the-art techniques while requiring roughly 2,000x less trainable parameters. For addressing domain gaps, we find that additionally prompt-tuning SAM's image encoder is beneficial, further improving segmentation accuracy by up to 18% over state-of-the-art results. Since PTSAM can be reliably trained with as little as 16 annotated images, we find it particularly helpful for applications with limited training data and domain shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable Adversarial Attacks on SAM and Its Downstream Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20197v3)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The utilization of large foundational models has a dilemma: while fine-tuning downstream tasks from them holds promise for making use of the well-generalized knowledge in practical applications, their open accessibility also poses threats of adverse usage. This paper, for the first time, explores the feasibility of adversarial attacking various downstream models fine-tuned from the segment anything model (SAM), by solely utilizing the information from the open-sourced SAM. In contrast to prevailing transfer-based adversarial attacks, we demonstrate the existence of adversarial dangers even without accessing the downstream task and dataset to train a similar surrogate model. To enhance the effectiveness of the adversarial attack towards models fine-tuned on unknown datasets, we propose a universal meta-initialization (UMI) algorithm to extract the intrinsic vulnerability inherent in the foundation model, which is then utilized as the prior knowledge to guide the generation of adversarial perturbations. Moreover, by formulating the gradient difference in the attacking process between the open-sourced SAM and its fine-tuned downstream models, we theoretically demonstrate that a deviation occurs in the adversarial update direction by directly maximizing the distance of encoded feature embeddings in the open-sourced SAM. Consequently, we propose a gradient robust loss that simulates the associated uncertainty with gradient-based noise augmentation to enhance the robustness of generated adversarial examples (AEs) towards this deviation, thus improving the transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed universal meta-initialized and gradient robust adversarial attack (UMI-GRAT) toward SAMs and their downstream models.

| **[SAUGE: Taming SAM for Uncertainty-Aligned Multi-Granularity Edge Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12892v3)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge labels are typically at various granularity levels owing to the varying preferences of annotators, thus handling the subjectivity of per-pixel labels has been a focal point for edge detection. Previous methods often employ a simple voting strategy to diminish such label uncertainty or impose a strong assumption of labels with a pre-defined distribution, e.g., Gaussian. In this work, we unveil that the segment anything model (SAM) provides strong prior knowledge to model the uncertainty in edge labels. Our key insight is that the intermediate SAM features inherently correspond to object edges at various granularities, which reflects different edge options due to uncertainty. Therefore, we attempt to align uncertainty with granularity by regressing intermediate SAM features from different layers to object edges at multi-granularity levels. In doing so, the model can fully and explicitly explore diverse ``uncertainties'' in a data-driven fashion. Specifically, we inject a lightweight module (~ 1.5% additional parameters) into the frozen SAM to progressively fuse and adapt its intermediate features to estimate edges from coarse to fine. It is crucial to normalize the granularity level of human edge labels to match their innate uncertainty. For this, we simply perform linear blending to the real edge labels at hand to create pseudo labels with varying granularities. Consequently, our uncertainty-aligned edge detector can flexibly produce edges at any desired granularity (including an optimal one). Thanks to SAM, our model uniquely demonstrates strong generalizability for cross-dataset edge detection. Extensive experimental results on BSDS500, Muticue and NYUDv2 validate our model's superiority.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |

While foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) show strong segmentation capabilities, SAM is limited in the task of building change detection due to domain gap issues. Existing adapter-based fine-tuning approaches face challenges with imbalanced building distribution, resulting in poor detection of subtle changes and inaccurate edge extraction. Additionally, bi-temporal misalignment in change detection, typically addressed by optical flow, remains vulnerable to background noises. This affects the detection of building changes and compromises both detection accuracy and edge recognition. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new SAM-Based Network with Distribution-Aware Fourier Adaptation and Edge-Constrained Warping (FAEWNet) for building change detection. FAEWNet utilizes the SAM encoder to extract rich visual features from remote sensing images. To guide SAM in focusing on specific ground objects in remote sensing scenes, we propose a Distribution-Aware Fourier Aggregated Adapter to aggregate task-oriented changed information. This adapter not only effectively addresses the domain gap issue, but also pays attention to the distribution of changed buildings. Furthermore, to mitigate noise interference and misalignment in height offset estimation, we design a novel flow module that refines building edge extraction and enhances the perception of changed buildings. Our state-of-the-art results on the LEVIR-CD, S2Looking and WHU-CD datasets highlight the effectiveness of FAEWNet.

One promising strategy for SDG is to leverage consistent semantic shape priors across different imaging protocols, scanner vendors, and clinical sites. However, existing dictionary learning methods that encode shape priors often suffer from limited representational power with a small set of offline computed shape elements, or overfitting when the dictionary size grows. Moreover, they are not readily compatible with large foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM). In this paper, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Shape-Experts (MoSE) framework that seamlessly integrates the idea of mixture-of-experts (MoE) training into dictionary learning to efficiently capture diverse and robust shape priors. Our method conceptualizes each dictionary atom as a shape expert, which specializes in encoding distinct semantic shape information. A gating network dynamically fuses these shape experts into a robust shape map, with sparse activation guided by SAM encoding to prevent overfitting. We further provide this shape map as a prompt to SAM, utilizing the powerful generalization capability of SAM through bidirectional integration. All modules, including the shape dictionary, are trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 workshop</p></details> |
| **[SAM-CP: Marrying SAM with Composable Prompts for Versatile Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16682v2)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything model (SAM) has shown a generalized ability to group image pixels into patches, but applying it to semantic-aware segmentation still faces major challenges. This paper presents SAM-CP, a simple approach that establishes two types of composable prompts beyond SAM and composes them for versatile segmentation. Specifically, given a set of classes (in texts) and a set of SAM patches, the Type-I prompt judges whether a SAM patch aligns with a text label, and the Type-II prompt judges whether two SAM patches with the same text label also belong to the same instance. To decrease the complexity in dealing with a large number of semantic classes and patches, we establish a unified framework that calculates the affinity between (semantic and instance) queries and SAM patches and merges patches with high affinity to the query. Experiments show that SAM-CP achieves semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation in both open and closed domains. In particular, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary segmentation. Our research offers a novel and generalized methodology for equipping vision foundation models like SAM with multi-grained semantic perception abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025; codes:https://github.com/ucas-vg/SAM-CP</p></details> |

Open-vocabulary image Segmentation addresses these generalization issues in traditional supervised segmentation models while reducing reliance on extensive per-pixel annotations, which are both expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. Most Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) methods are designed for natural images but struggle with remote sensing data due to scale variations, orientation changes, and complex scene compositions. This necessitates the development of OVS approaches specifically tailored for remote sensing. In this context, we propose AerOSeg, a novel OVS approach for remote sensing data. First, we compute robust image-text correlation features using multiple rotated versions of the input image and domain-specific prompts. These features are then refined through spatial and class refinement blocks. Inspired by the success of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in diverse domains, we leverage SAM features to guide the spatial refinement of correlation features. Additionally, we introduce a semantic back-projection module and loss to ensure the seamless propagation of SAM's semantic information throughout the segmentation pipeline. Finally, we enhance the refined correlation features using a multi-scale attention-aware decoder to produce the final segmentation map. We validate our SAM-guided Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Segmentation model on three benchmark remote sensing datasets: iSAID, DLRSD, and OpenEarthMap. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.54 h-mIoU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EarthVision workshop, CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Robust SAM: On the Adversarial Robustness of Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08906v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a widely used vision foundation model with diverse applications, including image segmentation, detection, and tracking. Given SAM's wide applications, understanding its robustness against adversarial attacks is crucial for real-world deployment. However, research on SAM's robustness is still in its early stages. Existing attacks often overlook the role of prompts in evaluating SAM's robustness, and there has been insufficient exploration of defense methods to balance the robustness and accuracy. To address these gaps, this paper proposes an adversarial robustness framework designed to evaluate and enhance the robustness of SAM. Specifically, we introduce a cross-prompt attack method to enhance the attack transferability across different prompt types. Besides attacking, we propose a few-parameter adaptation strategy to defend SAM against various adversarial attacks. To balance robustness and accuracy, we use the singular value decomposition (SVD) to constrain the space of trainable parameters, where only singular values are adaptable. Experiments demonstrate that our cross-prompt attack method outperforms previous approaches in terms of attack success rate on both SAM and SAM 2. By adapting only 512 parameters, we achieve at least a 15\% improvement in mean intersection over union (mIoU) against various adversarial attacks. Compared to previous defense methods, our approach enhances the robustness of SAM while maximally maintaining its original performance.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |
| **[S^4M: Boosting Semi-Supervised Instance Segmentation with SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05301v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised instance segmentation poses challenges due to limited labeled data, causing difficulties in accurately localizing distinct object instances. Current teacher-student frameworks still suffer from performance constraints due to unreliable pseudo-label quality stemming from limited labeled data. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers robust segmentation capabilities at various granularities, directly applying SAM to this task introduces challenges such as class-agnostic predictions and potential over-segmentation. To address these complexities, we carefully integrate SAM into the semi-supervised instance segmentation framework, developing a novel distillation method that effectively captures the precise localization capabilities of SAM without compromising semantic recognition. Furthermore, we incorporate pseudo-label refinement as well as a specialized data augmentation with the refined pseudo-labels, resulting in superior performance. We establish state-of-the-art performance, and provide comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[CMaP-SAM: Contraction Mapping Prior for SAM-driven Few-shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05049v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment new classes using few annotated images. While recent FSS methods have shown considerable improvements by leveraging Segment Anything Model (SAM), they face two critical limitations: insufficient utilization of structural correlations in query images, and significant information loss when converting continuous position priors to discrete point prompts. To address these challenges, we propose CMaP-SAM, a novel framework that introduces contraction mapping theory to optimize position priors for SAM-driven few-shot segmentation. CMaP-SAM consists of three key components: (1) a contraction mapping module that formulates position prior optimization as a Banach contraction mapping with convergence guarantees. This module iteratively refines position priors through pixel-wise structural similarity, generating a converged prior that preserves both semantic guidance from reference images and structural correlations in query images; (2) an adaptive distribution alignment module bridging continuous priors with SAM's binary mask prompt encoder; and (3) a foreground-background decoupled refinement architecture producing accurate final segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate CMaP-SAM's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 71.1 mIoU on PASCAL-$5^i$ and 56.1 on COCO-$20^i$ datasets.</p></details> | 7 figures |

Recent approaches in image manipulation detection have largely been driven by fully supervised approaches, which require labor-intensive pixel-level annotations. Thus, it is essential to explore weakly supervised image manipulation localization methods that only require image-level binary labels for training. However, existing weakly supervised image manipulation methods overlook the importance of edge information for accurate localization, leading to suboptimal localization performance. To address this, we propose a Context-Aware Boundary Localization (CABL) module to aggregate boundary features and learn context-inconsistency for localizing manipulated areas. Furthermore, by leveraging Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and Segment Anything Model (SAM), we introduce the CAM-Guided SAM Refinement (CGSR) module to generate more accurate manipulation localization maps. By integrating two modules, we present a novel weakly supervised framework based on a dual-branch Transformer-CNN architecture. Our method achieves outstanding localization performance across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective SAM Combination for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14723v2)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign pixel-level labels to images across an unlimited range of classes. Traditional methods address this by sequentially connecting a powerful mask proposal generator, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP. But these two-stage approaches often suffer from high computational costs, memory inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose ESC-Net, a novel one-stage open-vocabulary segmentation model that leverages the SAM decoder blocks for class-agnostic segmentation within an efficient inference framework. By embedding pseudo prompts generated from image-text correlations into SAM's promptable segmentation framework, ESC-Net achieves refined spatial aggregation for accurate mask predictions. ESC-Net achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks, including ADE20K, PASCAL-VOC, and PASCAL-Context, outperforming prior methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate its robustness across challenging conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, although SAM excels in fine-grained segmentation, it faces major challenges when applying it to semantic-aware segmentation. While CLIP exhibits a strong semantic understanding capability via aligning the global features of language and vision, it has deficiencies in fine-grained segmentation tasks. Human parsing requires to segment human bodies into constituent parts and involves both accurate fine-grained segmentation and high semantic understanding of each part. Based on traits of SAM and CLIP, we formulate high efficient modules to effectively integrate features of them to benefit human parsing. We propose a Semantic-Refinement Module to integrate semantic features of CLIP with SAM features to benefit parsing. Moreover, we formulate a high efficient Fine-tuning Module to adjust the pretrained SAM for human parsing that needs high semantic information and simultaneously demands spatial details, which significantly reduces the training time compared with full-time training and achieves notable performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on LIP, PPP, and CIHP databases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving SAM for Camouflaged Object Detection via Dual Stream Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06042v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment anything model (SAM) has shown impressive general-purpose segmentation performance on natural images, but its performance on camouflaged object detection (COD) is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose SAM-COD that performs camouflaged object detection for RGB-D inputs. While keeping the SAM architecture intact, dual stream adapters are expanded on the image encoder to learn potential complementary information from RGB images and depth images, and fine-tune the mask decoder and its depth replica to perform dual-stream mask prediction. In practice, the dual stream adapters are embedded into the attention block of the image encoder in a parallel manner to facilitate the refinement and correction of the two types of image embeddings. To mitigate channel discrepancies arising from dual stream embeddings that do not directly interact with each other, we augment the association of dual stream embeddings using bidirectional knowledge distillation including a model distiller and a modal distiller. In addition, to predict the masks for RGB and depth attention maps, we hybridize the two types of image embeddings which are jointly learned with the prompt embeddings to update the initial prompt, and then feed them into the mask decoders to synchronize the consistency of image embeddings and prompt embeddings. Experimental results on four COD benchmarks show that our SAM-COD achieves excellent detection performance gains over SAM and achieves state-of-the-art results with a given fine-tuning paradigm.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods address this issue through modality fusion, integrating textual and image information to provide more detailed priors. In this study, we argue that the granularity of text and the domain gap affect the accuracy of the priors. Furthermore, the discrepancy between high-level abstract semantics and pixel-level boundary details in images can introduce noise into the fusion process. To address this, we propose Prior-Guided SAM (PG-SAM), which employs a fine-grained modality prior aligner to leverage specialized medical knowledge for better modality alignment. The core of our method lies in efficiently addressing the domain gap with fine-grained text from a medical LLM. Meanwhile, it also enhances the priors' quality after modality alignment, ensuring more accurate segmentation. In addition, our decoder enhances the model's expressive capabilities through multi-level feature fusion and iterative mask optimizer operations, supporting unprompted learning. We also propose a unified pipeline that effectively supplies high-quality semantic information to SAM. Extensive experiments on the Synapse dataset demonstrate that the proposed PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Current monitoring methods involve measuring trees by hand for each species, requiring extensive cost, time, and labour. Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping and characterizing trees from aerial imagery, and large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), may be a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare SAM methods for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery of young tree plantations. We explore the potential of SAM for this task, and find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts, but that there is potential for methods which tune SAM further. We also show that predictions can be improved by adding Digital Surface Model (DSM) information as an input.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 ML4RS workshop</p></details> |

Although early research prioritized visual quality, preserving fine details and adapting to downstream tasks remains challenging. Recent approaches attempt task-specific design but rarely achieve "The Best of Both Worlds" due to inconsistent optimization goals. To address these issues, we propose a novel method that leverages the semantic knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to Grow the quality of fusion results and Enable downstream task adaptability, namely SAGE. Specifically, we design a Semantic Persistent Attention (SPA) Module that efficiently maintains source information via the persistent repository while extracting high-level semantic priors from SAM. More importantly, to eliminate the impractical dependence on SAM during inference, we introduce a bi-level optimization-driven distillation mechanism with triplet losses, which allow the student network to effectively extract knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a balance between high-quality visual results and downstream task adaptability while maintaining practical deployment efficiency.

However, SAM does not work when directly applied to medical image segmentation, since SAM lacks the ability to predict semantic labels, requires additional prompts, and presents suboptimal performance. Following the above issues, we propose MaskSAM, a novel mask classification prompt-free SAM adaptation framework for medical image segmentation. We design a prompt generator combined with the image encoder in SAM to generate a set of auxiliary classifier tokens, auxiliary binary masks, and auxiliary bounding boxes. Each pair of auxiliary mask and box prompts can solve the requirements of extra prompts. The semantic label prediction can be addressed by the sum of the auxiliary classifier tokens and the learnable global classifier tokens in the mask decoder of SAM. Meanwhile, we design a 3D depth-convolution adapter for image embeddings and a 3D depth-MLP adapter for prompt embeddings to efficiently fine-tune SAM. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AMOS2022, 90.52% Dice, which improved by 2.7% compared to nnUNet. Our method surpasses nnUNet by 1.7% on ACDC and 1.0% on Synapse datasets.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has shown superior advancements in image and video segmentation. However, SAM2 struggles with efficiency due to the high computational demands of processing high-resolution images and complex and long-range temporal dynamics in surgical videos. To address these challenges, we introduce Surgical SAM 2 (SurgSAM2), an advanced model to utilize SAM2 with an Efficient Frame Pruning (EFP) mechanism, to facilitate real-time surgical video segmentation. The EFP mechanism dynamically manages the memory bank by selectively retaining only the most informative frames, reducing memory usage and computational cost while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgSAM2 significantly improves both efficiency and segmentation accuracy compared to the vanilla SAM2. Remarkably, SurgSAM2 achieves a 3$\times$ FPS compared with SAM2, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance after fine-tuning with lower-resolution data. These advancements establish SurgSAM2 as a leading model for surgical video analysis, making real-time surgical video segmentation in resource-constrained environments a reality.

This can make the model selection process slow, non-extensive and highly subjective, while producing unrealistic looking parameter estimates with discrete jumps. We propose to model age-dependent SAM parameters using smoothing spline functions. This can lead to more smooth parameter estimates, while speeding up and making the model selection process more automatic and less subjective. We develop different spline models and compare them with already existing SAM models for a selection of 17 different fish stocks, using cross- and forward-validation methods. The results show that our automated spline models overall outcompete the officially developed SAM models. We also demonstrate how the developed spline models can be employed as a diagnostics tool for improving and better understanding properties of the officially developed SAM models.</p></details> |  |

Existing PEFT methods often lack robustness and fail to generalize effectively across diverse tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. To address this, we present a new highly computationally efficient framework called AdaZo-SAM, combining Adam and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) while requiring only a single-gradient computation in every iteration. This is achieved using a stochastic zeroth-order estimation to find SAM's ascent perturbation. We provide a convergence guarantee for AdaZo-SAM and show that it improves the generalization ability of state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Additionally, we design a low-rank gradient optimization method named LORENZA, which is a memory-efficient version of AdaZo-SAM. LORENZA utilizes a randomized SVD scheme to efficiently compute the subspace projection matrix and apply optimization steps onto the selected subspace. This technique enables full-parameter fine-tuning with adaptive low-rank gradient updates, achieving the same reduced memory consumption as gradient-low-rank-projection methods. We provide a convergence analysis of LORENZA and demonstrate its merits for pre-training and fine-tuning LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monge SAM: Robust Reparameterization-Invariant Sharpness-Aware Minimization Based on Loss Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08448v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on deep neural networks show that flat minima of the loss landscape correlate with improved generalization. Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) efficiently finds flat regions by updating the parameters according to the gradient at an adversarial perturbation. The perturbation depends on the Euclidean metric, making SAM non-invariant under reparametrizations, which blurs sharpness and generalization. We propose Monge SAM (M-SAM), a reparametrization invariant version of SAM by considering a Riemannian metric in the parameter space induced naturally by the loss surface. Compared to previous approaches, M-SAM works under any modeling choice, relies only on mild assumptions while being as computationally efficient as SAM. We theoretically argue that M-SAM varies between SAM and gradient descent (GD), which increases robustness to hyperparameter selection and reduces attraction to suboptimal equilibria like saddle points. We demonstrate this behavior both theoretically and empirically on a multi-modal representation alignment task.</p></details> |  |

Building on SAM's success in medical image segmentation, SAM 2 presents significant potential for further advancement. However, similar to SAM, SAM 2 is limited by its output of binary masks, inability to infer semantic labels, and dependence on precise prompts for the target object area. Additionally, direct application of SAM and SAM 2 to medical image segmentation tasks yields suboptimal results. In this paper, we explore the upper performance limit of SAM 2 using custom fine-tuning adapters, achieving a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 92.30% on the BTCV dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art nnUNet by 12%. Following this, we address the prompt dependency by investigating various prompt generators. We introduce a UNet to autonomously generate predicted masks and bounding boxes, which serve as input to SAM 2. Subsequent dual-stage refinements by SAM 2 further enhance performance. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the AMOS2022 dataset, with a Dice improvement of 2.9% compared to nnUNet, and outperforms nnUNet by 6.4% on the BTCV dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Avoiding spurious sharpness minimization broadens applicability of SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02407v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvature regularization techniques like Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) have shown great promise in improving generalization on vision tasks. However, we find that SAM performs poorly in domains like natural language processing (NLP), often degrading performance -- even with twice the compute budget. We investigate the discrepancy across domains and find that in the NLP setting, SAM is dominated by regularization of the logit statistics -- instead of improving the geometry of the function itself. We use this observation to develop an alternative algorithm we call Functional-SAM, which regularizes curvature only through modification of the statistics of the overall function implemented by the neural network, and avoids spurious minimization through logit manipulation. Furthermore, we argue that preconditioning the SAM perturbation also prevents spurious minimization, and when combined with Functional-SAM, it gives further improvements. Our proposed algorithms show improved performance over AdamW and SAM baselines when trained for an equal number of steps, in both fixed-length and Chinchilla-style training settings, at various model scales (including billion-parameter scale).

Given the 3D point cloud and multiple posed RGB-D frames of 3D scenes, our approach segments 3D instances by applying the pretrained Segment Anything Model (SAM) to 2D frames. Our key idea involves locating SAM prompts in 3D to align their projected pixel prompts across frames, ensuring the view consistency of SAM-predicted masks. Moreover, we suggest selecting prompts from the initial set guided by the information of SAM-predicted masks across all views, which enhances the overall performance. We further propose to consolidate different prompts if they are segmenting different surface parts of the same 3D instance, bringing a more comprehensive segmentation. Notably, our method does not require any additional training. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that our method achieves comparable or better performance compared to previous zero-shot or fully supervised approaches, and in many cases surpasses human annotations. Furthermore, since our fine-grained predictions often lack annotations in available datasets, we present ScanNet200-Fine50 test data which provides fine-grained annotations on 50 scenes from ScanNet200 dataset.

This paper presents Synthetic Anomaly Monitoring (SAM), an innovative approach that applies synthetic control methods from causal inference to improve both the accuracy and interpretability of anomaly detection processes. By modeling normal behavior through the treatment of each feature as a control unit, SAM identifies anomalies as deviations within this causal framework. We conducted extensive experiments comparing SAM with established benchmark models, including Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), across five diverse datasets, including Credit Card Fraud, HTTP Dataset CSIC 2010, and KDD Cup 1999, among others. Our results demonstrate that SAM consistently delivers robust performance, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for real-time anomaly detection in dynamic and complex environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, submitted for publication</p></details> |

To effectively deploy these models in real-world scenarios, it is essential to employ cross-domain adaptation techniques that bridge the gap between training data and real-world data. Recently, self-training with pseudo-labels has emerged as a predominant method for cross-domain adaptation in multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation. However, generating reliable pseudo-labels necessitates stringent constraints, which often result in sparse pseudo-labels after pruning. This sparsity can potentially hinder performance improvement during the adaptation process. We propose an image-guided pseudo-label enhancement approach that leverages the complementary 2D prior knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to introduce more reliable pseudo-labels, thereby boosting domain adaptation performance. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and the SAM masks from its paired image data, we collect all 3D points covered by each SAM mask that potentially belong to the same object. Then our method refines the pseudo-labels within each SAM mask in two steps. First, we determine the class label for each mask using majority voting and employ various constraints to filter out unreliable mask labels. Next, we introduce Geometry-Aware Progressive Propagation (GAPP) which propagates the mask label to all 3D points within the SAM mask while avoiding outliers caused by 2D-3D misalignment. Experiments conducted across multiple datasets and domain adaptation scenarios demonstrate that our proposed method significantly increases the quantity of high-quality pseudo-labels and enhances the adaptation performance over baseline methods.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |
| **[Vision and Language Reference Prompt into SAM for Few-shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00719v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a large-scale segmentation model that enables powerful zero-shot capabilities with flexible prompts. While SAM can segment any object in zero-shot, it requires user-provided prompts for each target image and does not attach any label information to masks. Few-shot segmentation models addressed these issues by inputting annotated reference images as prompts to SAM and can segment specific objects in target images without user-provided prompts. Previous SAM-based few-shot segmentation models only use annotated reference images as prompts, resulting in limited accuracy due to a lack of reference information. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot segmentation model, Vision and Language reference Prompt into SAM (VLP-SAM), that utilizes the visual information of the reference images and the semantic information of the text labels by inputting not only images but also language as reference information. In particular, VLP-SAM is a simple and scalable structure with minimal learnable parameters, which inputs prompt embeddings with vision-language information into SAM using a multimodal vision-language model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of VLP-SAM, we conducted experiments on the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets, and achieved high performance in the few-shot segmentation task, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art model by a large margin (6.3% and 9.5% in mIoU, respectively). Furthermore, VLP-SAM demonstrates its generality in unseen objects that are not included in the training data. Our code is available at https://github.com/kosukesakurai1/VLP-SAM.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Self-Prompt SAM: Medical Image Segmentation via Automatic Prompt SAM Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00630v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance and brought a range of unexplored capabilities to natural image segmentation tasks. However, as a very important branch of image segmentation, the performance of SAM remains uncertain when applied to medical image segmentation due to the significant differences between natural images and medical images. Meanwhile, it is harsh to meet the SAM's requirements of extra prompts provided, such as points or boxes to specify medical regions. In this paper, we propose a novel self-prompt SAM adaptation framework for medical image segmentation, named Self-Prompt-SAM. We design a multi-scale prompt generator combined with the image encoder in SAM to generate auxiliary masks. Then, we use the auxiliary masks to generate bounding boxes as box prompts and use Distance Transform to select the most central points as point prompts. Meanwhile, we design a 3D depth-fused adapter (DfusedAdapter) and inject the DFusedAdapter into each transformer in the image encoder and mask decoder to enable pre-trained 2D SAM models to extract 3D information and adapt to 3D medical images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms nnUNet by 2.3% on AMOS2022, 1.6% on ACDCand 0.5% on Synapse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Knowledge Distillation of SAM for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16740v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has set a new standard in interactive image segmentation, offering robust performance across various tasks. However, its significant computational requirements limit its deployment in real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel knowledge distillation approach, KD SAM, which incorporates both encoder and decoder optimization through a combination of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Perceptual Loss. This dual-loss framework captures structural and semantic features, enabling the student model to maintain high segmentation accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Based on the model evaluation on datasets, including Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2017, Fetal Head Ultrasound, and Breast Ultrasound, we demonstrate that KD SAM achieves comparable or superior performance to the baseline models, with significantly fewer parameters. KD SAM effectively balances segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for real-time medical image segmentation applications in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Unsupervised segmentation is promising to avoid human annotations while the performance is often limited. In this study, we present a novel unsupervised segmentation approach that leverages the capabilities of foundation models, and it consists of three main steps: (1) A vision-language model (i.e., CLIP) is employed to obtain image-level pseudo-labels for training a classification network. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) is then employed to extract Regions of Interest (ROIs), where an adaptive masking-based data augmentation is used to enhance ROI identification.(2) The ROIs are used to generate bounding box and point prompts for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain segmentation pseudo-labels. (3) A 3D segmentation network is trained with the SAM-derived pseudo-labels, where low-quality pseudo-labels are filtered out in a self-learning process based on the similarity between the SAM's output and the network's prediction. Evaluation on the BraTS2020 dataset demonstrates that our approach obtained an average Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 85.60%, outperforming five state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods by more than 10 percentage points. Besides, our approach outperforms directly using SAM for zero-shot inference, and its performance is close to fully supervised learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>22st ...</summary><p>22st IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2025)</p></details> |

To reduce the annotation cost and maintain satisfactory performance, in this work, we leverage the capabilities of SAM for establishing semi-supervised medical image segmentation models. Rethinking the requirements of effectiveness, efficiency, and compatibility, we propose a three-stage framework, i.e., Stitching, Fine-tuning, and Re-training (SFR). The current fine-tuning approaches mostly involve 2D slice-wise fine-tuning that disregards the contextual information between adjacent slices. Our stitching strategy mitigates the mismatch between natural and 3D medical images. The stitched images are then used for fine-tuning SAM, providing robust initialization of pseudo-labels. Afterwards, we train a 3D semi-supervised segmentation model while maintaining the same parameter size as the conventional segmenter such as V-Net. Our SFR framework is plug-and-play, and easily compatible with various popular semi-supervised methods. We also develop an extended framework SFR$^+$ with selective fine-tuning and re-training through confidence estimation. Extensive experiments validate that our SFR and SFR$^+$ achieve significant improvements in both moderate annotation and scarce annotation across five datasets. In particular, SFR framework improves the Dice score of Mean Teacher from 29.68% to 74.40% with only one labeled data of LA dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Skin Disease Diagnosis: Interpretable Visual Concept Discovery with SAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09520v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current AI-assisted skin image diagnosis has achieved dermatologist-level performance in classifying skin cancer, driven by rapid advancements in deep learning architectures. However, unlike traditional vision tasks, skin images in general present unique challenges due to the limited availability of well-annotated datasets, complex variations in conditions, and the necessity for detailed interpretations to ensure patient safety. Previous segmentation methods have sought to reduce image noise and enhance diagnostic performance, but these techniques require fine-grained, pixel-level ground truth masks for training. In contrast, with the rise of foundation models, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has been introduced to facilitate promptable segmentation, enabling the automation of the segmentation process with simple yet effective prompts. Efforts applying SAM predominantly focus on dermatoscopy images, which present more easily identifiable lesion boundaries than clinical photos taken with smartphones. This limitation constrains the practicality of these approaches to real-world applications. To overcome the challenges posed by noisy clinical photos acquired via non-standardized protocols and to improve diagnostic accessibility, we propose a novel Cross-Attentive Fusion framework for interpretable skin lesion diagnosis. Our method leverages SAM to generate visual concepts for skin diseases using prompts, integrating local visual concepts with global image features to enhance model performance. Extensive evaluation on two skin disease datasets demonstrates our proposed method's effectiveness on lesion diagnosis and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by WACV 2025</p></details> |

In contrast to traditional NAS methods, recently proposed one-shot NAS methods prove to be more efficient in performing NAS. One-shot NAS works by generating a singular weight-sharing supernetwork that acts as a search space (container) of subnetworks. Despite its achievements, designing the one-shot search space remains a major challenge. In this work we propose a search space design strategy for Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architectures. In particular, we convert the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a weight-sharing supernetwork called SuperSAM. Our approach involves automating the search space design via layer-wise structured pruning and parameter prioritization. While the structured pruning applies probabilistic removal of certain transformer layers, parameter prioritization performs weight reordering and slicing of MLP-blocks in the remaining layers. We train supernetworks on several datasets using the sandwich rule. For deployment, we enhance subnetwork discovery by utilizing a program autotuner to identify efficient subnetworks within the search space. The resulting subnetworks are 30-70% smaller in size compared to the original pre-trained SAM ViT-B, yet outperform the pretrained model. Our work introduces a new and effective method for ViT NAS search-space design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided SAM: Label-Efficient Part Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07434v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localizing object parts precisely is essential for tasks such as object recognition and robotic manipulation. Recent part segmentation methods require extensive training data and labor-intensive annotations. Segment-Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated good performance on a wide range of segmentation problems, but requires (manual) positional prompts to guide it where to segment. Furthermore, since it has been trained on full objects instead of object parts, it is prone to over-segmentation of parts. To address this, we propose a novel approach that guides SAM towards the relevant object parts. Our method learns positional prompts from coarse patch annotations that are easier and cheaper to acquire. We train classifiers on image patches to identify part classes and aggregate patches into regions of interest (ROIs) with positional prompts. SAM is conditioned on these ROIs and prompts. This approach, termed `Guided SAM', enhances efficiency and reduces manual effort, allowing effective part segmentation with minimal labeled data. We demonstrate the efficacy of Guided SAM on a dataset of car parts, improving the average IoU on state of the art models from 0.37 to 0.49 with annotations that are on average five times more efficient to acquire.</p></details> |  |

Remarkably, in pupil segmentation tasks, SAM 2 matches the performance of domain-specific models trained solely on eye images, achieving competitive mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) scores of up to 93% without fine-tuning.

However, the limited availability of enough 3D medical data restricts the generalization and robustness of most IMIS methods. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), though effective for 2D images, requires expensive semi-auto slice-by-slice annotations for 3D medical images. In this paper, we explore the zero-shot capabilities of SAM 2, the next-generation Meta SAM model trained on videos, for 3D medical image segmentation. By treating sequential 2D slices of 3D images as video frames, SAM 2 can fully automatically propagate annotations from a single frame to the entire 3D volume. We propose a practical pipeline for using SAM 2 in 3D medical image segmentation and present key findings highlighting its efficiency and potential for further optimization. Concretely, numerical experiments on the BraTS2020 and the medical segmentation decathlon datasets demonstrate that SAM 2 still has a gap with supervised methods but can narrow the gap in specific settings and organ types, significantly reducing the annotation burden on medical professionals.

| **[Region-Guided Attack on the Segment Anything Model (SAM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02974v3)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a cornerstone of image segmentation, demonstrating exceptional performance across various applications, particularly in autonomous driving and medical imaging, where precise segmentation is crucial. However, SAM is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can significantly impair its functionality through minor input perturbations. Traditional techniques, such as FGSM and PGD, are often ineffective in segmentation tasks due to their reliance on global perturbations that overlook spatial nuances. Recent methods like Attack-SAM-K and UAD have begun to address these challenges, but they frequently depend on external cues and do not fully leverage the structural interdependencies within segmentation processes. This limitation underscores the need for a novel adversarial strategy that exploits the unique characteristics of segmentation tasks. In response, we introduce the Region-Guided Attack (RGA), designed specifically for SAM. RGA utilizes a Region-Guided Map (RGM) to manipulate segmented regions, enabling targeted perturbations that fragment large segments and expand smaller ones, resulting in erroneous outputs from SAM. Our experiments demonstrate that RGA achieves high success rates in both white-box and black-box scenarios, emphasizing the need for robust defenses against such sophisticated attacks. RGA not only reveals SAM's vulnerabilities but also lays the groundwork for developing more resilient defenses against adversarial threats in image segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous research, which typically estimates target regions in the query using support prototypes and query pixels, we utilize the relationship between support and query prototypes. To achieve this, we utilize two complementary features: SAM Image Encoder features for pixel aggregation and ResNet features for class consistency. Specifically, we construct support and query prototypes with SAM features and distinguish query prototypes of target regions based on ResNet features. For the query prototype construction, we begin by roughly guiding foreground regions within SAM features using the conventional pseudo-mask, then employ iterative cross-attention to aggregate foreground features into learnable tokens. Here, we discover that the cross-attention weights can effectively alternate the conventional pseudo-mask. Therefore, we use the attention-based pseudo-mask to guide ResNet features to focus on the foreground, then infuse the guided ResNet feature into the learnable tokens to generate class-consistent query prototypes. The generation of the support prototype is conducted symmetrically to that of the query one, with the pseudo-mask replaced by the ground-truth mask. Finally, we compare these query prototypes with support ones to generate prompts, which subsequently produce object masks through the SAM Mask Decoder. Our state-of-the-art performances on various datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for FSS.

Machine Learning (ML) and Convolution Neural network (CNN) based Deep Learning (DL) techniques are primarily used for precise segmentation and classification of cancerous nodules in the CT (Computed Tomography) or MRI images. This study introduces an innovative approach to lung nodule segmentation by utilizing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) combined with transfer learning techniques. Precise segmentation of lung nodules is crucial for the early detection of lung cancer. The proposed method leverages Bounding Box prompts and a vision transformer model to enhance segmentation performance, achieving high accuracy, Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics.

Previous models struggle to learn feature representations that generalize to various unknown domains from limited training domain samples. In contrast, the large-scale visual model SAM, pre-trained on tens of millions of images from various domains and classes, possesses excellent generalizability. In this work, we propose a SAM-aware graph prompt reasoning network (GPRN) that fully leverages SAM to guide CD-FSS feature representation learning and improve prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose a SAM-aware prompt initialization module (SPI) to transform the masks generated by SAM into visual prompts enriched with high-level semantic information. Since SAM tends to divide an object into many sub-regions, this may lead to visual prompts representing the same semantic object having inconsistent or fragmented features. We further propose a graph prompt reasoning (GPR) module that constructs a graph among visual prompts to reason about their interrelationships and enable each visual prompt to aggregate information from similar prompts, thus achieving global semantic consistency. Subsequently, each visual prompt embeds its semantic information into the corresponding mask region to assist in feature representation learning. To refine the segmentation mask during testing, we also design a non-parameter adaptive point selection module (APS) to select representative point prompts from query predictions and feed them back to SAM to refine inaccurate segmentation results. Experiments on four standard CD-FSS datasets demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art results. Code: https://github.com/CVL-hub/GPRN.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

| **[SAM2-ELNet: Label Enhancement and Automatic Annotation for Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12404v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image segmentation is crucial for environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and resource management, but its performance largely depends on the quality of the dataset. Although several high-quality datasets are broadly accessible, data scarcity remains for specialized tasks like marine oil spill segmentation. Such tasks still rely on manual annotation, which is both time-consuming and influenced by subjective human factors. The segment anything model 2 (SAM2) has strong potential as an automatic annotation framework but struggles to perform effectively on heterogeneous, low-contrast remote sensing imagery. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel label enhancement and automatic annotation framework, termed SAM2-ELNet (Enhancement and Labeling Network). Specifically, we employ the frozen Hiera backbone from the pretrained SAM2 as the encoder, while fine-tuning the adapter and decoder for different remote sensing tasks. In addition, the proposed framework includes a label quality evaluator for filtering, ensuring the reliability of the generated labels. We design a series of experiments targeting resource-limited remote sensing tasks and evaluate our method on two datasets: the Deep-SAR Oil Spill (SOS) dataset with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, and the CHN6-CUG Road dataset with Very High Resolution (VHR) optical imagery. The proposed framework can enhance coarse annotations and generate reliable training data under resource-limited conditions. Fine-tuned on only 30% of the training data, it generates automatically labeled data. A model trained solely on these achieves slightly lower performance than using the full original annotations, while greatly reducing labeling costs and offering a practical solution for large-scale remote sensing interpretation.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce TASAM, a terrain and temporally-aware extension of SAM designed specifically for high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. TASAM integrates three lightweight yet effective modules: a terrain-aware adapter that injects elevation priors, a temporal prompt generator that captures land-cover changes over time, and a multi-scale fusion strategy that enhances fine-grained object delineation. Without retraining the SAM backbone, our approach achieves substantial performance gains across three remote sensing benchmarks-LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD-outperforming both zero-shot SAM and task-specific models with minimal computational overhead. Our results highlight the value of domain-adaptive augmentation for foundation models and offer a scalable path toward more robust geospatial segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Baltimore Atlas: FreqWeaver Adapter for Semi-supervised Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15565v2)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-high Spatial Resolution (UHSR) Land Cover Classification is increasingly important for urban analysis, enabling fine-scale planning, ecological monitoring, and infrastructure management. It identifies land cover types on sub-meter remote sensing imagery, capturing details such as building outlines, road networks, and distinct boundaries. However, most existing methods focus on 1 m imagery and rely heavily on large-scale annotations, while UHSR data remain scarce and difficult to annotate, limiting practical applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce Baltimore Atlas, a UHSR land cover classification framework that reduces reliance on large-scale training data and delivers high-accuracy results. Baltimore Atlas builds on three key ideas: (1) Baltimore Atlas Dataset, a 0.3 m resolution dataset based on aerial imagery of Baltimore City; (2) FreqWeaver Adapter, a parameter-efficient adapter that transfers SAM2 to this domain, leveraging foundation model knowledge to reduce training data needs while enabling fine-grained detail and structural modeling; (3) Uncertainty-Aware Teacher Student Framework, a semi-supervised framework that exploits unlabeled data to further reduce training dependence and improve generalization across diverse scenes. Using only 5.96% of total model parameters, our approach achieves a 1.78% IoU improvement over existing parameter-efficient tuning strategies and a 3.44% IoU gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution remote sensing segmentation methods on the Baltimore Atlas Dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViRefSAM: Visual Reference-Guided Segment Anything Model for Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02294v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically, ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features, enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$, LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[RS-MTDF: Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion for Remote Sensing Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08772v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation in remote sensing images is crucial for various applications, yet its performance is heavily reliant on large-scale, high-quality pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS methods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization. To alleviate this issue, we attempt to introduce the Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) pre-trained on vast and diverse datasets into the SSS task since VFMs possess robust generalization capabilities that can effectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for SSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge embedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing. Specifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (e.g., DINOv2 and CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student features with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative power, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder. Extensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing approaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in the majority of semantic categories. These results underscore the efficacy of multi-teacher VFM guidance in significantly enhancing both generalization and semantic understanding for remote sensing segmentation. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each proposed module.</p></details> |  |
| **[F2Net: A Frequency-Fused Network for Ultra-High Resolution Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07847v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery is critical for applications like environmental monitoring and urban planning but faces computational and optimization challenges. Conventional methods either lose fine details through downsampling or fragment global context via patch processing. While multi-branch networks address this trade-off, they suffer from computational inefficiency and conflicting gradient dynamics during training. We propose F2Net, a frequency-aware framework that decomposes UHR images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing. The high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution structural details, while the low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs through dual sub-branches capturing short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module integrates these observations, guided by two novel objectives: Cross-Frequency Alignment Loss ensures semantic consistency between frequency components, and Cross-Frequency Balance Loss regulates gradient magnitudes across branches to stabilize training. Evaluated on DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial benchmarks, F2Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 and 83.39, respectively. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate the extent to which urban sounds correspond with visual scenes by comparing various visual representation strategies in capturing acoustic semantics. We employ a multimodal approach that integrates geo-referenced sound recordings with both street-level and remote sensing imagery across three major global cities: London, New York, and Tokyo. Utilizing the AST model for audio, along with CLIP and RemoteCLIP for imagery, as well as CLIPSeg and Seg-Earth OV for semantic segmentation, we extract embeddings and class-level features to evaluate cross-modal similarity. The results indicate that street view embeddings demonstrate stronger alignment with environmental sounds compared to segmentation outputs, whereas remote sensing segmentation is more effective in interpreting ecological categories through a Biophony--Geophony--Anthrophony (BGA) framework. These findings imply that embedding-based models offer superior semantic alignment, while segmentation-based methods provide interpretable links between visual structure and acoustic ecology. This work advances the burgeoning field of multimodal urban sensing by offering novel perspectives for incorporating sound into geospatial analysis.</p></details> |  |

Open-vocabulary image Segmentation addresses these generalization issues in traditional supervised segmentation models while reducing reliance on extensive per-pixel annotations, which are both expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. Most Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) methods are designed for natural images but struggle with remote sensing data due to scale variations, orientation changes, and complex scene compositions. This necessitates the development of OVS approaches specifically tailored for remote sensing. In this context, we propose AerOSeg, a novel OVS approach for remote sensing data. First, we compute robust image-text correlation features using multiple rotated versions of the input image and domain-specific prompts. These features are then refined through spatial and class refinement blocks. Inspired by the success of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in diverse domains, we leverage SAM features to guide the spatial refinement of correlation features. Additionally, we introduce a semantic back-projection module and loss to ensure the seamless propagation of SAM's semantic information throughout the segmentation pipeline. Finally, we enhance the refined correlation features using a multi-scale attention-aware decoder to produce the final segmentation map. We validate our SAM-guided Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Segmentation model on three benchmark remote sensing datasets: iSAID, DLRSD, and OpenEarthMap. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.54 h-mIoU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EarthVision workshop, CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Center-guided Classifier for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16963v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared with natural images, remote sensing images (RSIs) have the unique characteristic. i.e., larger intraclass variance, which makes semantic segmentation for remote sensing images more challenging. Moreover, existing semantic segmentation models for remote sensing images usually employ a vanilla softmax classifier, which has three drawbacks: (1) non-direct supervision for the pixel representations during training; (2) inadequate modeling ability of parametric softmax classifiers under large intraclass variance; and (3) opaque process of classification decision. In this paper, we propose a novel classifier (called CenterSeg) customized for RSI semantic segmentation, which solves the abovementioned problems with multiple prototypes, direct supervision under Grassmann manifold, and interpretability strategy. Specifically, for each class, our CenterSeg obtains local class centers by aggregating corresponding pixel features based on ground-truth masks, and generates multiple prototypes through hard attention assignment and momentum updating. In addition, we introduce the Grassmann manifold and constrain the joint embedding space of pixel features and prototypes based on two additional regularization terms. Especially, during the inference, CenterSeg can further provide interpretability to the model by restricting the prototype as a sample of the training set. Experimental results on three remote sensing segmentation datasets validate the effectiveness of the model. Besides the superior performance, CenterSeg has the advantages of simplicity, lightweight, compatibility, and interpretability.

This task presents two principal challenges: (1) severe inconsistencies in feature representation across different remote sensing domains, and (2) a domain gap that emerges due to the representation bias of source domain patterns when translating features to predictive logits. To tackle these issues, we propose a joint-optimized adversarial network incorporating the "Segment Anything Model (SAM) (SAM-JOANet)" for UDA-RSSeg. Our approach integrates SAM to leverage its robust generalized representation capabilities, thereby alleviating feature inconsistencies. We introduce a finetuning decoder designed to convert SAM-Encoder features into predictive logits. Additionally, a feature-level adversarial-based prompted segmentor is employed to generate class-agnostic maps, which guide the finetuning decoder's feature representations. The network is optimized end-to-end, combining the prompted segmentor and the finetuning decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including ISPRS (Potsdam/Vaihingen) and CITY-OSM (Paris/Chicago), demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The results, supported by visualization and analysis, confirm the method's interpretability and robustness.

| **[Graph Information Bottleneck for Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02545v2)** | 2024-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing segmentation has a wide range of applications in environmental protection, and urban change detection, etc. Despite the success of deep learning-based remote sensing segmentation methods (e.g., CNN and Transformer), they are not flexible enough to model irregular objects. In addition, existing graph contrastive learning methods usually adopt the way of maximizing mutual information to keep the node representations consistent between different graph views, which may cause the model to learn task-independent redundant information. To tackle the above problems, this paper treats images as graph structures and introduces a simple contrastive vision GNN (SC-ViG) architecture for remote sensing segmentation. Specifically, we construct a node-masked and edge-masked graph view to obtain an optimal graph structure representation, which can adaptively learn whether to mask nodes and edges. Furthermore, this paper innovatively introduces information bottleneck theory into graph contrastive learning to maximize task-related information while minimizing task-independent redundant information. Finally, we replace the convolutional module in UNet with the SC-ViG module to complete the segmentation and classification tasks of remote sensing images. Extensive experiments on publicly available real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art remote sensing image segmentation methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Hi-ResNet: Edge Detail Enhancement for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12691v3)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution remote sensing (HRS) semantic segmentation extracts key objects from high-resolution coverage areas. However, objects of the same category within HRS images generally show significant differences in scale and shape across diverse geographical environments, making it difficult to fit the data distribution. Additionally, a complex background environment causes similar appearances of objects of different categories, which precipitates a substantial number of objects into misclassification as background. These issues make existing learning algorithms sub-optimal. In this work, we solve the above-mentioned problems by proposing a High-resolution remote sensing network (Hi-ResNet) with efficient network structure designs, which consists of a funnel module, a multi-branch module with stacks of information aggregation (IA) blocks, and a feature refinement module, sequentially, and Class-agnostic Edge Aware (CEA) loss. Specifically, we propose a funnel module to downsample, which reduces the computational cost, and extract high-resolution semantic information from the initial input image. Secondly, we downsample the processed feature images into multi-resolution branches incrementally to capture image features at different scales and apply IA blocks, which capture key latent information by leveraging attention mechanisms, for effective feature aggregation, distinguishing image features of the same class with variant scales and shapes. Finally, our feature refinement module integrate the CEA loss function, which disambiguates inter-class objects with similar shapes and increases the data distribution distance for correct predictions. With effective pre-training strategies, we demonstrated the superiority of Hi-ResNet over state-of-the-art methods on three HRS segmentation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

To fill the gap, our work introduces an innovative auto-labeling framework named ALPS (Automatic Labeling for Pre-training in Segmentation), leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to predict precise pseudo-labels for RS images without necessitating prior annotations or additional prompts. The proposed pipeline significantly reduces the labor and resource demands traditionally associated with annotating RS datasets. By constructing two comprehensive pseudo-labeled RS datasets via ALPS for pre-training purposes, our approach enhances the performance of downstream tasks across various benchmarks, including iSAID and ISPRS Potsdam. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its ability to generalize well across multiple tasks even under the scarcity of extensively annotated datasets, offering a scalable solution to automatic segmentation and annotation challenges in the field. In addition, the proposed a pipeline is flexible and can be applied to medical image segmentation, remarkably boosting the performance. Note that ALPS utilizes pre-trained SAM to semi-automatically annotate RS images without additional manual annotations. Though every component in the pipeline has bee well explored, integrating clustering algorithms with SAM and novel pseudo-label alignment significantly enhances RS segmentation, as an off-the-shelf tool for pre-training data preparation.

| **[Embedding Generalized Semantic Knowledge into Few-Shot Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13686v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot segmentation (FSS) for remote sensing (RS) imagery leverages supporting information from limited annotated samples to achieve query segmentation of novel classes. Previous efforts are dedicated to mining segmentation-guiding visual cues from a constrained set of support samples. However, they still struggle to address the pronounced intra-class differences in RS images, as sparse visual cues make it challenging to establish robust class-specific representations. In this paper, we propose a holistic semantic embedding (HSE) approach that effectively harnesses general semantic knowledge, i.e., class description (CD) embeddings.Instead of the naive combination of CD embeddings and visual features for segmentation decoding, we investigate embedding the general semantic knowledge during the feature extraction stage.Specifically, in HSE, a spatial dense interaction module allows the interaction of visual support features with CD embeddings along the spatial dimension via self-attention.Furthermore, a global content modulation module efficiently augments the global information of the target category in both support and query features, thanks to the transformative fusion of visual features and CD embeddings.These two components holistically synergize general CD embeddings and visual cues, constructing a robust class-specific representation.Through extensive experiments on the standard FSS benchmark, the proposed HSE approach demonstrates superior performance compared to peer work, setting a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

This framework employs a two-stage network design: the first stage extracts features using spatial methods to obtain features with sufficient spatial details and semantic information; the second stage maps these features in both spatial and frequency domains. In the frequency domain mapping, we introduce the Wavelet Transform Feature Decomposer (WTFD) structure, which decomposes features into low-frequency and high-frequency components using the Haar wavelet transform and integrates them with spatial features. To bridge the semantic gap between frequency and spatial features, and facilitate significant feature selection to promote the combination of features from different representation domains, we design the Multiscale Dual-Representation Alignment Filter (MDAF). This structure utilizes multiscale convolutions and dual-cross attentions. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, SFFNet achieves superior performance in terms of mIoU, reaching 84.80% and 87.73% respectively.The code is located at https://github.com/yysdck/SFFNet.</p></details> |  |

Segmentation and extraction of specific targets are essential tasks when facing the vast and complex remote sensing images. Recently, the introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides a universal pre-training model for image segmentation tasks. While the direct application of SAM to remote sensing image segmentation tasks does not yield satisfactory results, we propose RSAM-Seg, which stands for Remote Sensing SAM with Semantic Segmentation, as a tailored modification of SAM for the remote sensing field and eliminates the need for manual intervention to provide prompts. Adapter-Scale, a set of supplementary scaling modules, are proposed in the multi-head attention blocks of the encoder part of SAM. Furthermore, Adapter-Feature are inserted between the Vision Transformer (ViT) blocks. These modules aim to incorporate high-frequency image information and image embedding features to generate image-informed prompts. Experiments are conducted on four distinct remote sensing scenarios, encompassing cloud detection, field monitoring, building detection and road mapping tasks . The experimental results not only showcase the improvement over the original SAM and U-Net across cloud, buildings, fields and roads scenarios, but also highlight the capacity of RSAM-Seg to discern absent areas within the ground truth of certain datasets, affirming its potential as an auxiliary annotation method. In addition, the performance in few-shot scenarios is commendable, underscores its potential in dealing with limited datasets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

There are two research gaps in the current research: 1) Most studies only focus on the relationship between design elements and pay little attention to the external information of the site; 2) GAN and other traditional generative algorithms generate results with low resolution and insufficient details. To address these two problems, we integrate GAN, Stable diffusion multimodal large-scale image pre-training model to construct a full-process park generative design method: 1) First, construct a high-precision remote sensing object extraction system for automated extraction of urban environmental information; 2) Secondly, use GAN to construct a park design generation system based on the external environment, which can quickly infer and generate design schemes from urban environmental information; 3) Finally, introduce Stable Diffusion to optimize the design plan, fill in details, and expand the resolution of the plan by 64 times. This method can achieve a fully unmanned design automation workflow. The research results show that: 1) The relationship between the inside and outside of the site will affect the algorithm generation results. 2) Compared with traditional GAN algorithms, Stable diffusion significantly improve the information richness of the generated results.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, this paper proposes an efficient Generative Adversarial Transfomer (GATrans) for achieving high-precision semantic segmentation while maintaining an extremely efficient size. The framework utilizes a Global Transformer Network (GTNet) as the generator, efficiently extracting multi-level features through residual connections. GTNet employs global transformer blocks with progressively linear computational complexity to reassign global features based on a learnable similarity function. To focus on object-level and pixel-level information, the GATrans optimizes the objective function by combining structural similarity losses. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on the Vaihingen dataset, achieving an average F1 score of 90.17% and an overall accuracy of 91.92%.</p></details> |  |

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn unique and adaptive features to achieve this aim. However, due to the large size and high spatial resolution of remote sensing images, these networks cannot analyze an entire scene efficiently. Recently, deep transformers have proven their capability to record global interactions between different objects in the image. In this paper, we propose a new segmentation model that combines convolutional neural networks with transformers, and show that this mixture of local and global feature extraction techniques provides significant advantages in remote sensing segmentation. In addition, the proposed model includes two fusion layers that are designed to represent multi-modal inputs and output of the network efficiently. The input fusion layer extracts feature maps summarizing the relationship between image content and elevation maps (DSM). The output fusion layer uses a novel multi-task segmentation strategy where class labels are identified using class-specific feature extraction layers and loss functions. Finally, a fast-marching method is used to convert all unidentified class labels to their closest known neighbors. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methodology improves segmentation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

We quantify performance improvements on these remote sensing segmentation tasks when additional imagery outside of the original supervised dataset is made available for training. We also design experiments to test the effectiveness of these techniques when the test set is domain shifted to sample different geographic areas compared to the training and validation sets.

However, existing RS VQA datasets are constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain. RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1 then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises 13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs), demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Multimedia Conference (ACM Multimedia 2025)</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and (3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large language model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal large language models and remote sensing vision-language models.

A key challenge lies in the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several works introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs. However, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the quality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data, while only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for generating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using Rule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs generation methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from multiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset, including about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two VLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an image-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP and RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only 4.2\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches across benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or even exceed manual annotations.

In this work, we focus on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), a Vision-Language foundation model that achieves high accuracy across various image classification tasks and often rivals fully supervised baselines, despite not being explicitly trained for those tasks. Nevertheless, there are still domains where zero-shot CLIP performance is far from optimal, such as Remote Sensing (RS) and medical imagery. These domains do not only exhibit fundamentally different distributions compared to natural images, but also commonly rely on complementary modalities, beyond RGB, to derive meaningful insights. To this end, we propose a methodology to align distinct RS image modalities with the visual and textual modalities of CLIP. Our two-stage procedure addresses the aforementioned distribution shift, extends the zero-shot capabilities of CLIP and enriches CLIP's shared embedding space with domain-specific knowledge. Initially, we robustly fine-tune CLIP according to the PAINT (Ilharco et al., 2022) patching protocol, in order to deal with the distribution shift. Building upon this foundation, we facilitate the cross-modal alignment of a RS modality encoder by distilling knowledge from the CLIP visual and textual encoders. We empirically show that both patching and cross-modal alignment translate to significant performance gains, across several RS imagery classification and cross-modal retrieval benchmark datasets. Notably, these enhancements are achieved without the reliance on textual descriptions, without introducing any task-specific parameters, without training from scratch and without catastrophic forgetting.

| **[A Survey on Remote Sensing Foundation Models: From Vision to Multimodality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22081v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of remote sensing foundation models, particularly vision and multimodal models, has significantly enhanced the capabilities of intelligent geospatial data interpretation. These models combine various data modalities, such as optical, radar, and LiDAR imagery, with textual and geographic information, enabling more comprehensive analysis and understanding of remote sensing data. The integration of multiple modalities allows for improved performance in tasks like object detection, land cover classification, and change detection, which are often challenged by the complex and heterogeneous nature of remote sensing data. However, despite these advancements, several challenges remain. The diversity in data types, the need for large-scale annotated datasets, and the complexity of multimodal fusion techniques pose significant obstacles to the effective deployment of these models. Moreover, the computational demands of training and fine-tuning multimodal models require significant resources, further complicating their practical application in remote sensing image interpretation tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in vision and multimodal foundation models for remote sensing, focusing on their architecture, training methods, datasets and application scenarios. We discuss the key challenges these models face, such as data alignment, cross-modal transfer learning, and scalability, while also identifying emerging research directions aimed at overcoming these limitations. Our goal is to provide a clear understanding of the current landscape of remote sensing foundation models and inspire future research that can push the boundaries of what these models can achieve in real-world applications.

However, their conventional usage in zero-shot scene classification methods still involves dividing large images into patches and making independent predictions, i.e., inductive inference, thereby limiting their effectiveness by ignoring valuable contextual information. Our approach tackles this issue by utilizing initial predictions based on text prompting and patch affinity relationships from the image encoder to enhance zero-shot capabilities through transductive inference, all without the need for supervision and at a minor computational cost. Experiments on 10 remote sensing datasets with state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over inductive zero-shot classification.

While performing well in multi-modal reasoning and multi-turn conversations, the existing models lack pixel-level understanding and struggle with multi-image inputs. In this work, we propose RSUniVLM, a unified, end-to-end RS VLM designed for comprehensive vision understanding across multiple granularity, including image-level, region-level, and pixel-level tasks. RSUniVLM also performs effectively in multi-image analysis, with instances of change detection and change captioning. To enhance the model's ability to capture visual information at different levels without increasing model size, we design a novel architecture called Granularity-oriented Mixture of Experts to constraint the model to about 1 billion parameters. We also construct a large-scale RS instruction-following dataset based on a variety of existing datasets in both RS and general domain, encompassing various tasks such as object localization, visual question answering, and semantic segmentation. Substantial experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed RSUniVLM up to state-of-the-art across various RS tasks. Code and model will be available at \href{https://github.com/xuliu-cyber/RSUniVLM}{here}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aquila: A Hierarchically Aligned Visual-Language Model for Enhanced Remote Sensing Image Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06074v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large vision language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in visual language capabilities through visual instruction tuning, showing great promise in the field of remote sensing image interpretation. However, existing remote sensing vision language models (RSVLMs) often fall short in capturing the complex characteristics of remote sensing scenes, as they typically rely on low resolution, single scale visual features and simplistic methods to map visual features to language features. In this paper, we present Aquila, an advanced visual language foundation model designed to enable richer visual feature representation and more precise visual-language feature alignment for remote sensing images. Our approach introduces a learnable Hierarchical Spatial Feature Integration (SFI) module that supports high resolution image inputs and aggregates multi scale visual features, allowing for the detailed representation of complex visual information. Additionally, the SFI module is repeatedly integrated into the layers of the large language model (LLM) to achieve deep visual language feature alignment, without compromising the model's performance in natural language processing tasks. These innovations, capturing detailed visual effects through higher resolution and multi scale input, and enhancing feature alignment significantly improve the model's ability to learn from image text data. We validate the effectiveness of Aquila through extensive quantitative experiments and qualitative analyses, demonstrating its superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[RSGPT: A Remote Sensing Vision Language Model and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15266v1)** | 2023-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large-scale large language models, with GPT-4 as a prominent example, has significantly propelled the rapid advancement of artificial general intelligence and sparked the revolution of Artificial Intelligence 2.0. In the realm of remote sensing (RS), there is a growing interest in developing large vision language models (VLMs) specifically tailored for data analysis in this domain. However, current research predominantly revolves around visual recognition tasks, lacking comprehensive, large-scale image-text datasets that are aligned and suitable for training large VLMs, which poses significant challenges to effectively training such models for RS applications. In computer vision, recent research has demonstrated that fine-tuning large vision language models on small-scale, high-quality datasets can yield impressive performance in visual and language understanding. These results are comparable to state-of-the-art VLMs trained from scratch on massive amounts of data, such as GPT-4. Inspired by this captivating idea, in this work, we build a high-quality Remote Sensing Image Captioning dataset (RSICap) that facilitates the development of large VLMs in the RS field. Unlike previous RS datasets that either employ model-generated captions or short descriptions, RSICap comprises 2,585 human-annotated captions with rich and high-quality information. This dataset offers detailed descriptions for each image, encompassing scene descriptions (e.g., residential area, airport, or farmland) as well as object information (e.g., color, shape, quantity, absolute position, etc). To facilitate the evaluation of VLMs in the field of RS, we also provide a benchmark evaluation dataset called RSIEval. This dataset consists of human-annotated captions and visual question-answer pairs, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of VLMs in the context of RS.</p></details> |  |

SPF is capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev</p></details> | <details><summary>CoRL ...</summary><p>CoRL 2025.

| **[CapRL: Stimulating Dense Image Caption Capabilities via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22647v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning. A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

| **[Hierarchical Representation Matching for CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22645v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as "a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details. Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[WoW: Towards a World omniscient World model Through Embodied Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22642v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans develop an understanding of intuitive physics through active interaction with the world. This approach is in stark contrast to current video models, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore struggle with grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our central hypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded in extensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test this hypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model trained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that the model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of plausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical hallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability can be actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, where vision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide its refinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, a co-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans into executable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. We establish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causal reasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in both human and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical causality, collision dynamics, and object permanence. Our work provides systematic evidence that large-scale, real-world interaction is a cornerstone for developing physical intuition in AI. Models, data, and benchmarks will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPARK: Synergistic Policy And Reward Co-Evolving Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22624v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback (RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks, 12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project:https://github.com/InternLM/Spark</p></details> |

Meanwhile, the development of specialized accessibility features typically requires substantial programming effort and is often implemented on a game-by-game basis. To address these challenges, we introduce GamerAstra, a multi-agent human-AI collaboration framework that leverages a multi-agent design to facilitate access to 2D non-twitch video games for BLV players. It integrates vision-language models and computer vision techniques, enabling interaction with games lacking native accessibility support. The framework also incorporates custom assistance granularities to support varying degrees of visual impairment and enhances interface navigation through multiple input modalities. Technical evaluations and user studies indicate that GamerAstra effectively enhances playability and provides a more immersive gaming experience for BLV players. These findings also underscore potential avenues for advancing intelligent accessibility frameworks in the gaming domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Color Names in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22524v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs, replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions. Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[OS-W2S: An Automatic Labeling Engine for Language-Guided Open-Set Aerial Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03334v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, language-guided open-set aerial object detection has gained significant attention due to its better alignment with real-world application needs. However, due to limited datasets, most existing language-guided methods primarily focus on vocabulary-level descriptions, which fail to meet the demands of fine-grained open-world detection. To address this limitation, we propose constructing a large-scale language-guided open-set aerial detection dataset, encompassing three levels of language guidance: from words to phrases, and ultimately to sentences. Centered around an open-source large vision-language model and integrating image-operation-based preprocessing with BERT-based postprocessing, we present the OS-W2S Label Engine, an automatic annotation pipeline capable of handling diverse scene annotations for aerial images. Using this label engine, we expand existing aerial detection datasets with rich textual annotations and construct a novel benchmark dataset, called MI-OAD, addressing the limitations of current remote sensing grounding data and enabling effective language-guided open-set aerial detection. Specifically, MI-OAD contains 163,023 images and 2 million image-caption pairs, approximately 40 times larger than comparable datasets. To demonstrate the effectiveness and quality of MI-OAD, we evaluate three representative tasks. On language-guided open-set aerial detection, training on MI-OAD lifts Grounding DINO by +31.1 AP$_{50}$ and +34.7 Recall@10 with sentence-level inputs under zero-shot transfer. Moreover, using MI-OAD for pre-training yields state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing open-vocabulary aerial detection and remote sensing visual grounding benchmarks, validating both the effectiveness of the dataset and the high quality of its OS-W2S annotations. More details are available at https://github.com/GT-Wei/MI-OAD.</p></details> |  |

Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets. We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary sequences. Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures.

While recent evaluations suggest that vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on diagram-related benchmarks, their reliance on knowledge, reasoning, or modality shortcuts raises concerns about whether they genuinely understand and reason over diagrams. To address this gap, we introduce Chimera, a comprehensive test suite comprising 7,500 high-quality diagrams sourced from Wikipedia; each diagram is annotated with its symbolic content represented by semantic triples along with multi-level questions designed to assess four fundamental aspects of diagram comprehension: entity recognition, relation understanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. We use Chimera to measure the presence of three types of shortcuts in visual question answering: (1) the visual-memorization shortcut, where VLMs rely on memorized visual patterns; (2) the knowledge-recall shortcut, where models leverage memorized factual knowledge instead of interpreting the diagram; and (3) the Clever-Hans shortcut, where models exploit superficial language patterns or priors without true comprehension. We evaluate 15 open-source VLMs from 7 model families on Chimera and find that their seemingly strong performance largely stems from shortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact, knowledge-recall shortcuts play a moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts contribute significantly. These findings expose critical limitations in current VLMs and underscore the need for more robust evaluation protocols that benchmark genuine comprehension of complex visual inputs (e.g., diagrams) rather than question-answering shortcuts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code (https://github.com/CHIzhP/Chimera) and data (https://huggingface.co/datasets/CHIzhP/Chimera) are publicly available</p></details> |

A growing body of literature shows that PTLMs fail inconsistently and non-intuitively, demonstrating a lack of reasoning and grounding. To take a first step toward quantifying the effect of grounding (or lack thereof), we curate a novel and comprehensive dataset of object affordances -- Text2Afford, characterized by 15 affordance classes. Unlike affordance datasets collected in vision and language domains, we annotate in-the-wild sentences with objects and affordances. Experimental results reveal that PTLMs exhibit limited reasoning abilities when it comes to uncommon object affordances. We also observe that pre-trained VLMs do not necessarily capture object affordances effectively. Through few-shot fine-tuning, we demonstrate improvement in affordance knowledge in PTLMs and VLMs. Our research contributes a novel dataset for language grounding tasks, and presents insights into LM capabilities, advancing the understanding of object affordances.

| **[RAU: Reference-based Anatomical Understanding with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22404v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly, its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated clinical workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Effort Image-to-Music Generation: An Interpretable RAG-based VLM Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22378v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Image-to-Music (I2M) generation has garnered significant attention, with potential applications in fields such as gaming, advertising, and multi-modal art creation. However, due to the ambiguous and subjective nature of I2M tasks, most end-to-end methods lack interpretability, leaving users puzzled about the generation results. Even methods based on emotion mapping face controversy, as emotion represents only a singular aspect of art. Additionally, most learning-based methods require substantial computational resources and large datasets for training, hindering accessibility for common users. To address these challenges, we propose the first Vision Language Model (VLM)-based I2M framework that offers high interpretability and low computational cost. Specifically, we utilize ABC notation to bridge the text and music modalities, enabling the VLM to generate music using natural language. We then apply multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and self-refinement techniques to allow the VLM to produce high-quality music without external training. Furthermore, we leverage the generated motivations in text and the attention maps from the VLM to provide explanations for the generated results in both text and image modalities. To validate our method, we conduct both human studies and machine evaluations, where our method outperforms others in terms of music quality and music-image consistency, indicating promising results.

Existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings indicate that typographic attacks remain effective against state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models, especially those employing vision encoders inherently vulnerable to such attacks. However, employing larger Large Language Model backbones reduces this vulnerability while simultaneously enhancing typographic understanding. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. Finally, we publicly release the datasets introduced in this paper, along with the code for evaluations under www.bliss.berlin/research/scam.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 Workshop EVAL-FoMo-2</p></details> |

Despite recent progress, 3D VLMs still fall short of their 2D counterparts in capability and robustness. A key bottleneck is that current scene representations struggle to balance performance and efficiency: competitive performance comes at the cost of heavy token overhead, which in turn hampers the scalability of 3D-VL learning. To address this, we propose the condensed feature grid (CFG), an efficient scene representation featuring significantly reduced token overhead and strong perception capability. Building on CFG, we introduce LEO-VL, a 3D VLM trained on 700k 3D-VL data spanning four real-world indoor domains and five tasks such as captioning and dialogue. To enhance the robustness of 3D VLM, we further propose SceneDPO for post-training, which involves contrasts across answers and scenes. LEO-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on various 3D QA benchmarks, including SQA3D, MSQA, and Beacon3D. Our extensive experiments highlight the efficiency of our representation, the benefit of task and scene diversity, consistent scaling effects, and the advantages of SceneDPO compared to SFT and GRPO. We hope our findings advance the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of future 3D VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://leo-vl.github.io</p></details> |

| **[Beyond Classification Accuracy: Neural-MedBench and the Need for Deeper Reasoning Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22258v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation. To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed, which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.</p></details> | 23 pages, 12 figures |

To adapt these large transformer-based models efficiently for downstream tasks, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like (Low-Rank Adaptation) LoRA have emerged as scalable alternatives to full fine-tuning, especially in few-shot scenarios. However, like traditional deep neural networks, VLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations can significantly degrade model performance. Adversarial training remains the most effective strategy for improving model robustness in PEFT. In this work, we propose AdvCLIP-LoRA, to our knowledge the first method designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of CLIP models fine-tuned with LoRA in few-shot settings. Our method formulates training as a minimax optimization over low-rank adapters and adversarial perturbations, enabling robust adaptation with a small trainable footprint. Across eight datasets and two backbones (ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32), AdvCLIP-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot classification, adversarial base-to-new generalization, and cross-dataset transfer, delivering higher adversarial robustness than prompt tuning baselines without sacrificing much clean accuracy. These findings highlight AdvCLIP-LoRA as a practical approach for robust adaptation of VLMs in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Tale of Two Experts: Cooperative Learning for Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22229v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that (1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2) separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3) enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polysemous Language Gaussian Splatting via Matching-based Mask Lifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22225v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously addressing their monosemous limitations.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT), a framework that models remote sensing analysis as a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model, RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks. The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon publication serves as a concrete pathway from opaque perception towards structured, verifiable reasoning for Earth Observation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting the Asymmetric Uncertainty Structure of Pre-trained VLMs on the Unit Hypersphere](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11029v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) as foundation models have significantly enhanced performance across a wide range of visual and textual tasks, without requiring large-scale training from scratch for downstream tasks. However, these deterministic VLMs fail to capture the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty in natural language and visual data. Recent probabilistic post-hoc adaptation methods address this by mapping deterministic embeddings onto probability distributions; however, existing approaches do not account for the asymmetric uncertainty structure of the modalities, and the constraint that meaningful deterministic embeddings reside on a unit hypersphere, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we address the asymmetric uncertainty structure inherent in textual and visual data, and propose AsymVLM to build probabilistic embeddings from pre-trained VLMs on the unit hypersphere, enabling uncertainty quantification. We validate the effectiveness of the probabilistic embeddings on established benchmarks, and present comprehensive ablation studies demonstrating the inherent nature of asymmetry in the uncertainty structure of textual and visual data.</p></details> |  |

However, their visual and structural richness poses challenges for large vision-language models (LVLMs), which are typically trained on plain charts. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChartGalaxy, a million-scale dataset designed to advance the understanding and generation of infographic charts. The dataset is constructed through an inductive process that identifies 75 chart types, 440 chart variations, and 68 layout templates from real infographic charts and uses them to create synthetic ones programmatically. We showcase the utility of this dataset through: 1) improving infographic chart understanding via fine-tuning, 2) benchmarking code generation for infographic charts, and 3) enabling example-based infographic chart generation. By capturing the visual and structural complexity of real design, ChartGalaxy provides a useful resource for enhancing multimodal reasoning and generation in LVLMs.</p></details> | 58 pages |
| **[Actions as Language: Fine-Tuning VLMs into VLAs Without Catastrophic Forgetting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22195v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) on robot teleoperation data to create vision-language-action (VLA) models is a promising paradigm for training generalist policies, but it suffers from a fundamental tradeoff: learning to produce actions often diminishes the VLM's foundational reasoning and multimodal understanding, hindering generalization to novel scenarios, instruction following, and semantic understanding. We argue that this catastrophic forgetting is due to a distribution mismatch between the VLM's internet-scale pretraining corpus and the robotics fine-tuning data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce VLM2VLA: a VLA training paradigm that first resolves this mismatch at the data level by representing low-level actions with natural language. This alignment makes it possible to train VLAs solely with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), thereby minimally modifying the VLM backbone and averting catastrophic forgetting. As a result, the VLM can be fine-tuned on robot teleoperation data without fundamentally altering the underlying architecture and without expensive co-training on internet-scale VLM datasets. Through extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) studies and over 800 real-world robotics experiments, we demonstrate that VLM2VLA preserves the VLM's core capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization to novel tasks that require open-world semantic reasoning and multilingual instruction following.</p></details> |  |

Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine, two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse, large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately, MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks, while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report; GitHub Repo: https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU; Hugging Face Model: https://huggingface.co/opendatalab/MinerU2.5-2509-1.2B; Hugging Face Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/opendatalab/MinerU</p></details> |
| **[pFedMMA: Personalized Federated Fine-Tuning with Multi-Modal Adapter for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05394v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our optimization strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared component is exchanged during communication rounds. Through extensive experiments across eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DriveAgent-R1: Advancing VLM-based Autonomous Driving with Active Perception and Hybrid Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20879v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly advanced end-to-end autonomous driving, demonstrating powerful reasoning abilities for high-level behavior planning tasks. However, existing methods are often constrained by a passive perception paradigm, relying solely on text-based reasoning. This passivity restricts the model's capacity to actively seek crucial visual evidence when faced with uncertainty. To address this, we introduce DriveAgent-R1, the first autonomous driving agent capable of active perception for planning. In complex scenarios, DriveAgent-R1 proactively invokes tools to perform visual reasoning, firmly grounding its decisions in visual evidence, thereby enhancing both interpretability and reliability. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid thinking framework, inspired by human driver cognitive patterns, allowing the agent to adaptively switch between efficient text-only reasoning and robust tool-augmented visual reasoning based on scene complexity. This capability is cultivated through a three-stage progressive training strategy, featuring a core Cascaded Reinforcement Learning (Cascaded RL) phase. Extensive experiments on the Drive-Internal dataset, which is rich in long-tail scenarios, and the public nuScenes dataset show that, with only 3B parameters, DriveAgent-R1 achieves competitive performance comparable to top closed model systems such as GPT-5 and to human driving proficiency while remaining deployment-friendly, offering a proven path toward building more intelligent autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

We review 31 models and 21 benchmarks, spanning encoder-only and generative architectures, and identify a key tension between language neutrality (consistent cross-lingual representations) and cultural awareness (adaptation to cultural contexts). Current training methods favor neutrality through contrastive learning, while cultural awareness depends on diverse data. Two-thirds of evaluation benchmarks use translation-based approaches prioritizing semantic consistency, though recent work incorporates culturally grounded content. We find discrepancies in cross-lingual capabilities and gaps between training objectives and evaluation goals.</p></details> |  |
| **[XBOUND: Exploring Capability Boundaries of Device-Control Agents at the State Level](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21279v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in vision-language models have increased interest in Device-Control Agents (DC agents) for managing graphical user interfaces (GUIs). With the growing complexity and integration of such agents into various applications, effective evaluation methods have become crucial. The current evaluation method for DC agents primarily focuses on the instruction level, providing the current state (e.g., screenshots) and past execution history to determine actions for target instructions, helping identify potential execution failures. However, in GUI environments, a single state may contain multiple interactive widgets, each linked to different instructions, presenting an opportunity for diverse actions based on various instruction targets. Evaluating the agent's performance solely at the instruction level may overlook the broader context of these interactions. To capture a more comprehensive view of agent performance, we propose a new evaluation method, XBOUND, to evaluate the accuracy of instruction completion on a per-state basis. XBOUND provides a state-level evaluation framework, serving as a tool to assess agents' capabilities within environmental states. Our evaluation yields several key insights: UI-TARS stands out as the strongest 7B model, current agents display a bimodal performance pattern in instruction unification, and sub-7B models remain limited in state mastery. We further identify GPT-based planning as a critical bottleneck, and show that grounding data mainly benefits action matching, while trajectory data is more effective for instruction unification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight Structured Multimodal Reasoning for Clinical Scene Understanding in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22014v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare robotics requires robust multimodal perception and reasoning to ensure safety in dynamic clinical environments. Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general-purpose capabilities but remain limited in temporal reasoning, uncertainty estimation, and structured outputs needed for robotic planning. We present a lightweight agentic multimodal framework for video-based scene understanding. Combining the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model with a SmolAgent-based orchestration layer, it supports chain-of-thought reasoning, speech-vision fusion, and dynamic tool invocation. The framework generates structured scene graphs and leverages a hybrid retrieval module for interpretable and adaptive reasoning. Evaluations on the Video-MME benchmark and a custom clinical dataset show competitive accuracy and improved robustness compared to state-of-the-art VLMs, demonstrating its potential for applications in robot-assisted surgery, patient monitoring, and decision support.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[CoFFT: Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought for Visual Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22010v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1) Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps; (2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of 3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[ERGO: Efficient High-Resolution Visual Understanding for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21991v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end, we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V* benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a 3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at: https://github.com/nota-github/ERGO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind-the-Glitch: Visual Correspondence for Detecting Inconsistencies in Subject-Driven Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21989v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for advancing this task.

| **[From Bias to Balance: Exploring and Mitigating Spatial Bias in LVLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21984v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE, introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more holistic visual understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resolving Ambiguity in Gaze-Facilitated Visual Assistant Interaction Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21980v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users' attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention. In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set. Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable, exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses, with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for evidence anchored defenses.</p></details> | 19figures, 37pages |

While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs) have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models. Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL, LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, NeurIPS Workshop SpaVLE</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from 2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data proactively collected by drivers of autonomous vehicles to ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete action labels collected directly from drivers' actual driving operations, and implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3% without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Bench...</summary><p>Benchmark: https://huggingface.co/datasets/LiAuto-DriveAction/drive-action</p></details> |

With the integration of vision modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have mainly overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap, we propose RECITE ($\textbf{Re}$source $\textbf{C}$onsumpt$\textbf{i}$on Red-$\textbf{Te}$aming for LVLMs), the first approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs red-teaming. First, we present $\textit{Vision Guided Optimization}$, a fine-grained pixel-level optimization to obtain \textit{Output Recall Objective} adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to achieve the goal of RCAs. Empirical results demonstrate that RECITE increases service response latency by over 26 $\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and memory consumption.

However, deploying these models can be unreliable when significant distribution gaps exist between training and test data, while fine-tuning for diverse scenarios is often costly. Cache-based test-time adapters offer an efficient alternative by storing representative test samples to guide subsequent classifications. Yet, these methods typically employ naive cache management with limited capacity, leading to severe catastrophic forgetting when samples are inevitably dropped during updates. In this paper, we propose DOTA (DistributiOnal Test-time Adaptation), a simple yet effective method addressing this limitation. Crucially, instead of merely memorizing individual test samples, DOTA continuously estimates the underlying distribution of the test data stream. Test-time posterior probabilities are then computed using these dynamically estimated distributions via Bayes' theorem for adaptation. This distribution-centric approach enables the model to continually learn and adapt to the deployment environment. Extensive experiments validate that DOTA significantly mitigates forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, current co-speech gesture generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (e.g. speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To address this gap, we introduce Intentional-Gesture, a novel framework that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in high-level communicative functions. First, we curate the InG dataset by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (i.e., text sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the Intentional Gesture Motion Tokenizer to leverage these intention annotations. It injects high-level communicative functions (e.g., intentions) into tokenized motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture</p></details> |  |

In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images, thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual prompts, contributing to the development of more ethical AI applications in social media.</p></details> | <details><summary>Defac...</summary><p>Defactify 3 workshop at AAAI 2024</p></details> |

Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer (GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals, producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Although VLMs have been employed for solving geometry problems, their ability to recognize geometric features remains insufficiently analyzed. To address this gap, we propose a benchmark that evaluates the recognition of visual geometric features, including primitives such as dots and lines, and relations such as orthogonality. Our preliminary study shows that vision encoders often used in general-purpose VLMs, e.g., OpenCLIP, fail to detect these features and struggle to generalize across domains. To overcome the limitation, we develop GeoCLIP, a CLIP-based model trained on synthetic geometric diagram--caption pairs. Benchmark results show that GeoCLIP outperforms existing vision encoders in recognizing geometric features. We then propose our VLM, GeoDANO, which augments GeoCLIP with a domain adaptation strategy for unseen diagram styles. GeoDANO outperforms specialized methods for plane geometry problems and GPT-4o on MathVerse. The implementation is available at https://github.com/ml-postech/GeoDANO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP-Findings 2025</p></details> |

Prophecy is based on the observation that a significant part of the logic of feed-forward networks is captured in the activation status of the neurons at inner layers. Prophecy works by extracting rules based on neuron activations (values or on/off statuses) as preconditions that imply certain desirable output property, e.g., the prediction being a certain class. These rules represent network properties captured in the hidden layers that imply the desired output behavior. We present the architecture of the tool, highlight its features and demonstrate its usage on different types of models and output properties. We present an overview of its applications, such as inferring and proving formal explanations of neural networks, compositional verification, run-time monitoring, repair, and others. We also show novel results highlighting its potential in the era of large vision-language models.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a range of visual understanding tasks, largely due to their strong generalization capabilities. However, despite initial efforts to apply VLMs to the Img2LaTeX task, their performance remains suboptimal. Empirical evidence shows that VLMs can be challenged by fine-grained visual elements, such as subscripts and superscripts in mathematical expressions, which results in inaccurate LaTeX generation. To address this challenge, we propose $A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework, enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve LaTeX generation quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset, Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$ significantly improves model performance across various evaluation metrics spanning both textual and visual levels; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and further evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach and the synergy of its core components during inference.</p></details> |  |

Vision-Language Models Get Lost in Font Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23768v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable visual and linguistic capabilities, achieving impressive performance in various tasks such as image recognition and object localization. However, their effectiveness in fine-grained tasks remains an open question. In everyday scenarios, individuals encountering design materials, such as magazines, typography tutorials, research papers, or branding content, may wish to identify aesthetically pleasing fonts used in the text. Given their multimodal capabilities and free accessibility, many VLMs are often considered potential tools for font recognition. This raises a fundamental question: Do VLMs truly possess the capability to recognize fonts? To investigate this, we introduce the Font Recognition Benchmark (FRB), a compact and well-structured dataset comprising 15 commonly used fonts. FRB includes two versions: (i) an easy version, where 10 sentences are rendered in different fonts, and (ii) a hard version, where each text sample consists of the names of the 15 fonts themselves, introducing a stroop effect that challenges model perception. Through extensive evaluation of various VLMs on font recognition tasks, we arrive at the following key findings: (i) Current VLMs exhibit limited font recognition capabilities, with many state-of-the-art models failing to achieve satisfactory performance and being easily affected by the stroop effect introduced by textual information. (ii) Few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting provide minimal benefits in improving font recognition accuracy across different VLMs. (iii) Attention analysis sheds light on the inherent limitations of VLMs in capturing semantic features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |

Motivated by the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), we propose the Input-Space Linearity Hypothesis (ISLH), which posits that concept-aligned directions originate in the input space and are selectively amplified with increasing depth. We then introduce the Spectral Principal Path (SPP) framework, which formalizes how deep networks progressively distill linear representations along a small set of dominant spectral directions. Building on this framework, we further demonstrate the multimodal robustness of these representations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By bridging theoretical insights with empirical validation, this work advances a structured theory of representation formation in deep networks, paving the way for improving AI robustness, fairness, and transparency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2503.22720</p></details> |

Although satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive, contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset. Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness. Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models, attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 40 figures, 3 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Vision Language Models Cannot Plan, but Can They Formalize?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21576v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of vision language models (VLMs) has empowered embodied agents to accomplish simple multimodal planning tasks, but not long-horizon ones requiring long sequences of actions. In text-only simulations, long-horizon planning has seen significant improvement brought by repositioning the role of LLMs. Instead of directly generating action sequences, LLMs translate the planning domain and problem into a formal planning language like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), which can call a formal solver to derive the plan in a verifiable manner. In multimodal environments, research on VLM-as-formalizer remains scarce, usually involving gross simplifications such as predefined object vocabulary or overly similar few-shot examples. In this work, we present a suite of five VLM-as-formalizer pipelines that tackle one-shot, open-vocabulary, and multimodal PDDL formalization. We evaluate those on an existing benchmark while presenting another two that for the first time account for planning with authentic, multi-view, and low-quality images. We conclude that VLM-as-formalizer greatly outperforms end-to-end plan generation. We reveal the bottleneck to be vision rather than language, as VLMs often fail to capture an exhaustive set of necessary object relations. While generating intermediate, textual representations such as captions or scene graphs partially compensate for the performance, their inconsistent gain leaves headroom for future research directions on multimodal planning formalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning GUI Grounding with Spatial Reasoning from Visual Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21552v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow 93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.</p></details> |  |

While recent vision-language model (VLM) based zero-shot approaches reduce dependence on prior maps and scene-specific training data, they face significant limitations: spatiotemporal discontinuity from discrete observations, unstructured memory representations, and insufficient task understanding leading to navigation failures. We propose DORAEMON (Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory Oriented Navigation), a novel cognitive-inspired framework consisting of Ventral and Dorsal Streams that mimics human navigation capabilities. The Dorsal Stream implements the Hierarchical Semantic-Spatial Fusion and Topology Map to handle spatiotemporal discontinuities, while the Ventral Stream combines RAG-VLM and Policy-VLM to improve decision-making. Our approach also develops Nav-Ensurance to ensure navigation safety and efficiency. We evaluate DORAEMON on the HM3D, MP3D, and GOAT datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on both success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL) metrics, significantly outperforming existing methods. We also introduce a new evaluation metric (AORI) to assess navigation intelligence better. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DORAEMON's effectiveness in zero-shot autonomous navigation without requiring prior map building or pre-training.</p></details> |  |

Our design begins by enabling effective pipelining across vision encode, LLM prefill, and LLM decode stages of VLMs, by exploiting their heterogeneous resource demands during execution and incorporating elastic GPU spatial partitioning among stages to maximally utilize the compute and memory resources. Building on this, we introduce a real-time scheduling algorithm that adaptively calibrates resource allocation among stages based on a Pareto-optimal analysis of the latency-throughput trade-off, allowing the system to sustain responsiveness and resource efficiency under dynamic request loads. To further alleviate GPU memory pressure, we design a lightweight weight offloading strategy for vision encoders that preserves inference efficiency with minimized memory overhead. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world agent workloads demonstrate that Nova consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, improving the maximum latency by up to 23.3%, while keeping competitive throughput.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, large-scale vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) offer powerful zero-shot capabilities on static images, while motion vectors (MV) provide highly efficient temporal information directly from compressed video streams. To synergize the strengths of these paradigms, we propose MoCLIP-Lite, a simple yet powerful two-stream late fusion framework for efficient video recognition. Our approach combines features from a frozen CLIP image encoder with features from a lightweight, supervised network trained on raw MV. During fusion, both backbones are frozen, and only a tiny Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head is trained, ensuring extreme efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments on the UCF101 dataset, our method achieves a remarkable 89.2% Top-1 accuracy, significantly outperforming strong zero-shot (65.0%) and MV-only (66.5%) baselines. Our work provides a new, highly efficient baseline for video understanding that effectively bridges the gap between large static models and dynamic, low-cost motion cues.

We introduce DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%, boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves 93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses.

When a homonym appears in a prompt, diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.</p></details> |  |

While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations. This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at GenProCC NeurIPS 2025 Workshop</p></details> |

Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization. However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST, show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST, demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model attention that better reflects human intuition.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, neurips workshop</p></details> |

Additionally, existing visual table understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4 million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88% preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and extensible evaluation of future VTU models.</p></details> |  |

This survey delves into advanced VLA methods, aiming to provide a clear taxonomy and a systematic, comprehensive review of existing research.

In addition, foundational datasets, benchmarks, and simulation platforms are introduced. Building on the current VLA landscape, the review further proposes perspectives on key challenges and future directions to advance research in VLA models and generalizable robotics. By synthesizing insights from over three hundred recent studies, this survey maps the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose VLA methods.</p></details> |  |

A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21173v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as \textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs) to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence. The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Modal Instructions for Robot Motion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21107v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot. While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm, Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mammo-CLIP Dissect: A Framework for Analysing Mammography Concepts in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21102v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists' workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories (e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g., density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept learning. Code and concept set are available: https://github.com/Suaiba/Mammo-CLIP-Dissect.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoM-1K: A Thousand-Problem Benchmark Dataset for Strength of Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21079v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems, mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6% accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models, particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Perception Bottleneck of VLMs for Chart Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18435v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chart understanding requires models to effectively analyze and reason about numerical data, textual elements, and complex visual components. Our observations reveal that the perception capabilities of existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) constitute a critical bottleneck in this process. In this study, we delve into this perception bottleneck by decomposing it into two components: the vision encoder bottleneck, where the visual representation may fail to encapsulate the correct information, and the extraction bottleneck, where the language model struggles to extract the necessary information from the provided visual representations. Through comprehensive experiments, we find that (1) the information embedded within visual representations is substantially richer than what is typically captured by linear extractors, such as the widely used retrieval accuracy metric; (2) While instruction tuning effectively enhances the extraction capability of LVLMs, the vision encoder remains a critical bottleneck, demanding focused attention and improvement. Therefore, we further enhance the visual encoder to mitigate the vision encoder bottleneck under a contrastive learning framework. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly mitigates the perception bottleneck and improves the ability of LVLMs to comprehend charts.

We introduce FASTER (Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3) aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for research.

This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery, charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions. Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide': internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically, the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques. Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Medical Image Analysis.

| **[MTRDrive: Memory-Tool Synergistic Reasoning for Robust Autonomous Driving in Corner Cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20843v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models(VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for end-to-end autonomous driving, yet a substantial gap remains between their current capabilities and the reliability necessary for real-world deployment. A critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive decision-making. MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits. This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark based on complex Roadwork construction scenarios to rigorously evaluate zero-shot generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach. On the public NAVSIM benchmark, our 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves an exceptional PDMS of 88.3 without chain-of-thought and sets a state-of-the-art performance bar on high-level planning, with a driving metric score of 79.8\% and a planning accuracy of 82.6\%. Rigorous zero-shot evaluation on the new Roadwork-VLM benchmark shows a strong ability to reason robustly in unseen scenarios, achieving a driving metric score of 80.2\%. These results highlight MTRDrive's potential to advance autonomous driving toward safer and more reliable systems.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[OmniScene: Attention-Augmented Multimodal 4D Scene Understanding for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19973v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is capable of transforming two-dimensional observations into an egocentric three-dimensional scene understanding, which underpins the ability to translate complex scenes and exhibit adaptive behaviors. This capability, however, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where mainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather than true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel human-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene Vision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then, harnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation, we embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic supervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like attentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with human driving behaviors, forming a more human-like perception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality contributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates the relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple abstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from visual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more nuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information. We evaluate OmniScene comprehensively on the nuScenes dataset, benchmarking it against over ten state-of-the-art models across various tasks. Our approach consistently achieves superior results, establishing new benchmarks in perception, prediction, planning, and visual question answering.</p></details> |  |

While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy. Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV2025 Workshop on Safe and Trustworthy Multimodal AI Systems</p></details> |
| **[Efficiently Disentangling CLIP for Multi-Object Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02977v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models like CLIP excel at recognizing the single, prominent object in a scene. However, they struggle in complex scenes containing multiple objects. We identify a fundamental reason for this limitation: VLM feature space exhibits excessive mutual feature information (MFI), where the features of one class contain substantial information about other, unrelated classes. This high MFI becomes evident during class-specific queries, as unrelated objects are activated alongside the queried class. To address this limitation, we propose DCLIP, an efficient framework that learns an optimal level of mutual information while adding only minimal learnable parameters to a frozen VLM. DCLIP uses two complementary losses: a novel MFI Loss that regulates class feature similarity to prevent excessive overlap while preserving necessary shared information, and the Asymmetric Loss (ASL) that aligns image features with the disentangled text features. Through this disentanglement, DCLIP reduces excessive inter-class similarity by 30%. On multi-label recognition, DCLIP performs favorably over SOTA approaches on VOC2007 and COCO-14 while using 75% fewer training parameters. For zero-shot semantic segmentation, it shows improved performance across six benchmark datasets. These results highlight the importance of feature disentanglement for multi-object perception in VLMs.</p></details> |  |

The system constructs a dual-modal knowledge base from reference texts and images, enabling raw visual, edge-enhanced, and semantic retrieval to identify stylistically similar objects. Retrieved candidates are synthesized by the VLM to generate structured inferences, including chronological, geographical, and cultural attributions, alongside interpretive justifications. We evaluate the system on a set of Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from the British Museum. Expert evaluation demonstrates that the system produces meaningful and interpretable outputs, offering scholars concrete starting points for analysis and significantly alleviating the cognitive burden of navigating vast comparative corpora.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing Through Words, Speaking Through Pixels: Deep Representational Alignment Between Vision and Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20751v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios, and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered (e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (camera-ready)</p></details> |

Overhead imagery provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level, language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into geospatial and emergency-management workflows.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

However, the amount of available robotics data in the wild is growing exponentially, creating new opportunities for large-scale data utilization. Reliable temporal task completion prediction could help automatically annotate and curate this data at scale. The Generative Value Learning (GVL) approach was recently proposed, leveraging the knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs) to predict task progress from visual observations. Building upon GVL, we propose OpenGVL, a comprehensive benchmark for estimating task progress across diverse challenging manipulation tasks involving both robotic and human embodiments. We evaluate the capabilities of publicly available open-source foundation models, showing that open-source model families significantly underperform closed-source counterparts, achieving only approximately $70\%$ of their performance on temporal progress prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate how OpenGVL can serve as a practical tool for automated data curation and filtering, enabling efficient quality assessment of large-scale robotics datasets. We release the benchmark along with the complete codebase at \href{github.com/budzianowski/opengvl}{OpenGVL}.</p></details> |  |

A computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve). InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask, and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2025 and Published at CVPR 2025 AI for Content Creation workshop</p></details> |

To address this, we propose AnyPlace, a two-stage method trained entirely on synthetic data, capable of predicting a wide range of feasible placement poses for real-world tasks. Our key insight is that by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to identify rough placement locations, we focus only on the relevant regions for local placement, which enables us to train the low-level placement-pose-prediction model to capture diverse placements efficiently. For training, we generate a fully synthetic dataset of randomly generated objects in different placement configurations (insertion, stacking, hanging) and train local placement-prediction models. We conduct extensive evaluations in simulation, demonstrating that our method outperforms baselines in terms of success rate, coverage of possible placement modes, and precision. In real-world experiments, we show how our approach directly transfers models trained purely on synthetic data to the real world, where it successfully performs placements in scenarios where other models struggle -- such as with varying object geometries, diverse placement modes, and achieving high precision for fine placement.

| **[Multimodal Reference Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02876v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual grounding focuses on detecting objects from images based on language expressions. Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced visual grounding performance by training large models with large-scale datasets. However, the problem remains challenging, especially when similar objects appear in the input image. For example, an LVLM may not be able to differentiate Diet Coke and regular Coke in an image. In this case, if additional reference images of Diet Coke and regular Coke are available, it can help the visual grounding of similar objects. In this work, we introduce a new task named Multimodal Reference Visual Grounding (MRVG). In this task, a model has access to a set of reference images of objects in a database. Based on these reference images and a language expression, the model is required to detect a target object from a query image. We first introduce a new dataset to study the MRVG problem. Then we introduce a novel method, named MRVG-Net, to solve this visual grounding problem. We show that by efficiently using reference images with few-shot object detection and using Large Language Models (LLMs) for object matching, our method achieves superior visual grounding performance compared to the state-of-the-art LVLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Our approach bridges the gap between few-shot detection and visual grounding, unlocking new capabilities for visual understanding, which has wide applications in robotics.

| **[Enhancing Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models via Intermediate Projector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13739v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) raises safety concerns, as adversaries may exploit model vulnerabilities to induce harmful outputs, with targeted black-box adversarial attacks posing a particularly severe threat. However, existing methods primarily maximize encoder-level global similarity, which lacks the granularity for stealthy and practical fine-grained attacks, where only specific target should be altered (e.g., modifying a car while preserving its background). Moreover, they largely neglect the projector, a key semantic bridge in VLMs for multimodal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a novel black-box targeted attack framework that leverages the projector. Specifically, we utilize the widely adopted Querying Transformer (Q-Former) which transforms global image embeddings into fine-grained query outputs, to enhance attack effectiveness and granularity. For standard global targeted attack scenarios, we propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), which aligns Q-Former fine-grained query outputs with the target to enhance attack strength and exploits the intermediate pretrained Q-Former that is not fine-tuned for any specific Large Language Model (LLM) to improve attack transferability. For fine-grained attack scenarios, we augment IPGA with the Residual Query Alignment (RQA) module, which preserves unrelated content by constraining non-target query outputs to enhance attack granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IPGA significantly outperforms baselines in global targeted attacks, and IPGA with RQA (IPGA-R) attains superior success rates and unrelated content preservation over baselines in fine-grained attacks. Our method also transfers effectively to commercial VLMs such as Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT.</p></details> |  |

However, in medical image analysis, their performance and adoption remain limited due to the lack of a robust ecosystem, insufficient toolsets, and the absence of real-time interactive expert feedback. Here we present "TissueLab", a co-evolving agentic AI system that allows researchers to ask direct questions, automatically plan and generate explainable workflows, and conduct real-time analyses where experts can visualize intermediate results and refine them. TissueLab integrates tool factories across pathology, radiology, and spatial omics domains. By standardizing inputs, outputs, and capabilities of diverse tools, the system determines when and how to invoke them to address research and clinical questions. Across diverse tasks with clinically meaningful quantifications that inform staging, prognosis, and treatment planning, TissueLab achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with end-to-end vision-language models (VLMs) and other agentic AI systems such as GPT-5. Moreover, TissueLab continuously learns from clinicians, evolving toward improved classifiers and more effective decision strategies. With active learning, it delivers accurate results in unseen disease contexts within minutes, without requiring massive datasets or prolonged retraining. Released as a sustainable open-source ecosystem, TissueLab aims to accelerate computational research and translational adoption in medical imaging while establishing a foundation for the next generation of medical AI.</p></details> |  |

| **[Universal Camouflage Attack on Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20196v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2) Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore, UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisualTrap: A Stealthy Backdoor Attack on GUI Agents via Visual Grounding Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06899v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets. VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover, the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments, e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments. These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor attack risks in GUI agents.</p></details> | Accepted in COLM2025 |

However, potential misuse or safety alignment concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation (JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms for VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[EchoBench: Benchmarking Sycophancy in Medical Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20146v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent benchmarks for medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) emphasize leaderboard accuracy, overlooking reliability and safety. We study sycophancy -- models' tendency to uncritically echo user-provided information -- in high-stakes clinical settings. We introduce EchoBench, a benchmark to systematically evaluate sycophancy in medical LVLMs. It contains 2,122 images across 18 departments and 20 modalities with 90 prompts that simulate biased inputs from patients, medical students, and physicians. We evaluate medical-specific, open-source, and proprietary LVLMs. All exhibit substantial sycophancy; the best proprietary model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) still shows 45.98% sycophancy, and GPT-4.1 reaches 59.15%. Many medical-specific models exceed 95% sycophancy despite only moderate accuracy. Fine-grained analyses by bias type, department, perceptual granularity, and modality identify factors that increase susceptibility. We further show that higher data quality/diversity and stronger domain knowledge reduce sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy. EchoBench also serves as a testbed for mitigation: simple prompt-level interventions (negative prompting, one-shot, few-shot) produce consistent reductions and motivate training- and decoding-time strategies. Our findings highlight the need for robust evaluation beyond accuracy and provide actionable guidance toward safer, more trustworthy medical LVLMs.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |
| **[GraphEQA: Using 3D Semantic Scene Graphs for Real-time Embodied Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14480v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Embodied Question Answering (EQA), agents must explore and develop a semantic understanding of an unseen environment to answer a situated question with confidence. This problem remains challenging in robotics, due to the difficulties in obtaining useful semantic representations, updating these representations online, and leveraging prior world knowledge for efficient planning and exploration. To address these limitations, we propose GraphEQA, a novel approach that utilizes real-time 3D metric-semantic scene graphs (3DSGs) and task relevant images as multi-modal memory for grounding Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to perform EQA tasks in unseen environments. We employ a hierarchical planning approach that exploits the hierarchical nature of 3DSGs for structured planning and semantics-guided exploration. We evaluate GraphEQA in simulation on two benchmark datasets, HM-EQA and OpenEQA, and demonstrate that it outperforms key baselines by completing EQA tasks with higher success rates and fewer planning steps. We further demonstrate GraphEQA in multiple real-world home and office environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://saumyasaxena.github.io/grapheqa</p></details> |
| **[A Simple Data Augmentation Strategy for Text-in-Image Scientific VQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20119v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific visual question answering poses significant challenges for vision-language models due to the complexity of scientific figures and their multimodal context. Traditional approaches treat the figure and accompanying text (e.g., questions and answer options) as separate inputs. EXAMS-V introduced a new paradigm by embedding both visual and textual content into a single image. However, even state-of-the-art proprietary models perform poorly on this setup in zero-shot settings, underscoring the need for task-specific fine-tuning. To address the scarcity of training data in this "text-in-image" format, we synthesize a new dataset by converting existing separate image-text pairs into unified images. Fine-tuning a small multilingual multimodal model on a mix of our synthetic data and EXAMS-V yields notable gains across 13 languages, demonstrating strong average improvements and cross-lingual transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WiNLP, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Discrete Diffusion for Reflective Vision-Language-Action Models in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20109v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-End (E2E) solutions have emerged as a mainstream approach for autonomous driving systems, with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models representing a new paradigm that leverages pre-trained multimodal knowledge from Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and interact with complex real-world environments. However, these methods remain constrained by the limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges, we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable solution for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Queryable 3D Scene Representation: A Multi-Modal Framework for Semantic Reasoning and Robotic Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20077v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enable robots to comprehend high-level human instructions and perform complex tasks, a key challenge lies in achieving comprehensive scene understanding: interpreting and interacting with the 3D environment in a meaningful way. This requires a smart map that fuses accurate geometric structure with rich, human-understandable semantics. To address this, we introduce the 3D Queryable Scene Representation (3D QSR), a novel framework built on multimedia data that unifies three complementary 3D representations: (1) 3D-consistent novel view rendering and segmentation from panoptic reconstruction, (2) precise geometry from 3D point clouds, and (3) structured, scalable organization via 3D scene graphs. Built on an object-centric design, the framework integrates with large vision-language models to enable semantic queryability by linking multimodal object embeddings, and supporting object-level retrieval of geometric, visual, and semantic information. The retrieved data are then loaded into a robotic task planner for downstream execution. We evaluate our approach through simulated robotic task planning scenarios in Unity, guided by abstract language instructions and using the indoor public dataset Replica. Furthermore, we apply it in a digital duplicate of a real wet lab environment to test QSR-supported robotic task planning for emergency response. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to facilitate scene understanding and integrate spatial and semantic reasoning, effectively translating high-level human instructions into precise robotic task planning in complex 3D environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeSteer: Adaptive Subspace Steering for Efficient Jailbreak Defense in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21400v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) continue to improve, they are increasingly targeted by jailbreak attacks. Existing defense methods face two major limitations: (1) they struggle to ensure safety without compromising the model's utility; and (2) many defense mechanisms significantly reduce the model's inference efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose SafeSteer, a lightweight, inference-time steering framework that effectively defends against diverse jailbreak attacks without modifying model weights. At the core of SafeSteer is the innovative use of Singular Value Decomposition to construct a low-dimensional "safety subspace." By projecting and reconstructing the raw steering vector into this subspace during inference, SafeSteer adaptively removes harmful generation signals while preserving the model's ability to handle benign inputs. The entire process is executed in a single inference pass, introducing negligible overhead. Extensive experiments show that SafeSteer reduces the attack success rate by over 60% and improves accuracy on normal tasks by 1-2%, without introducing significant inference latency. These results demonstrate that robust and practical jailbreak defense can be achieved through simple, efficient inference-time control.</p></details> |  |
| **[To Trust Or Not To Trust Your Vision-Language Model's Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23745v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in aligning visual and textual modalities, enabling a wide range of applications in multimodal understanding and generation. While they excel in zero-shot and transfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification, often yielding confident yet incorrect predictions. This limitation poses a significant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can lead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a training-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of estimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed modality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly represented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring function that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We rigorously evaluate our approach across 17 diverse datasets, employing 4 architectures and 2 VLMs, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of up to 51.87% in AURC, 9.14% in AUROC, and 32.42% in FPR95 compared to existing baselines. By improving the reliability of the model without requiring retraining, TrustVLM paves the way for safer deployment of VLMs in real-world applications.

| **[Generalist Robot Manipulation beyond Action Labeled Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19958v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generalist robot manipulation leverage pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large-scale robot demonstrations to tackle diverse tasks in a zero-shot manner. A key challenge remains: scaling high-quality, action-labeled robot demonstration data, which existing methods rely on for robustness and generalization. To address this, we propose a method that benefits from videos without action labels - featuring humans and/or robots in action - enhancing open-vocabulary performance and enabling data-efficient learning of new tasks. Our method extracts dense, dynamic 3D point clouds at the hand or gripper location and uses a proposed 3D dynamics predictor for self-supervision. This predictor is then tuned to an action predictor using a smaller labeled dataset for action alignment. We show that our method not only learns from unlabeled human and robot demonstrations - improving downstream generalist robot policies - but also enables robots to learn new tasks without action labels (i.e., out-of-action generalization) in both real-world and simulated settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Conference on Robot Learning 2025</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Gaslighting Attacks Against Speech Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19858v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) become increasingly integrated into voice-based applications, ensuring their robustness against manipulative or adversarial input becomes critical. Although prior work has studied adversarial attacks in text-based LLMs and vision-language models, the unique cognitive and perceptual challenges of speech-based interaction remain underexplored. In contrast, speech presents inherent ambiguity, continuity, and perceptual diversity, which make adversarial attacks more difficult to detect. In this paper, we introduce gaslighting attacks, strategically crafted prompts designed to mislead, override, or distort model reasoning as a means to evaluate the vulnerability of Speech LLMs. Specifically, we construct five manipulation strategies: Anger, Cognitive Disruption, Sarcasm, Implicit, and Professional Negation, designed to test model robustness across varied tasks. It is worth noting that our framework captures both performance degradation and behavioral responses, including unsolicited apologies and refusals, to diagnose different dimensions of susceptibility. Moreover, acoustic perturbation experiments are conducted to assess multi-modal robustness. To quantify model vulnerability, comprehensive evaluation across 5 Speech and multi-modal LLMs on over 10,000 test samples from 5 diverse datasets reveals an average accuracy drop of 24.3% under the five gaslighting attacks, indicating significant behavioral vulnerability. These findings highlight the need for more resilient and trustworthy speech-based AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Existing vision-language models (VLMs), however, are designed for modern, standardized texts and are not equipped to read the diverse languages and scripts, irregular layouts, and frequent degradation found in historical materials. This paper presents CHURRO, a 3B-parameter open-weight VLM specialized for historical text recognition. The model is trained on CHURRO-DS, the largest historical text recognition dataset to date. CHURRO-DS unifies 155 historical corpora comprising 99,491 pages, spanning 22 centuries of textual heritage across 46 language clusters, including historical variants and dead languages. We evaluate several open-weight and closed VLMs and optical character recognition (OCR) systems on CHURRO-DS and find that CHURRO outperforms all other VLMs. On the CHURRO-DS test set, CHURRO achieves 82.3% (printed) and 70.1% (handwritten) normalized Levenshtein similarity, surpassing the second-best model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, by 1.4% and 6.5%, respectively, while being 15.5 times more cost-effective. By releasing the model and dataset, we aim to enable community-driven research to improve the readability of historical texts and accelerate scholarship.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[Logics-Parsing Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19760v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Vision-Language models (LVLM) have spurred significant progress in document parsing task. Compared to traditional pipeline-based methods, end-to-end paradigms have shown their excellence in converting PDF images into structured outputs through integrated Optical Character Recognition (OCR), table recognition, mathematical formula recognition and so on. However, the absence of explicit analytical stages for document layouts and reading orders limits the LVLM's capability in handling complex document types such as multi-column newspapers or posters. To address this limitation, we propose in this report Logics-Parsing: an end-to-end LVLM-based model augmented with reinforcement learning. Our model incorporates meticulously designed reward mechanisms to optimize complex layout analysis and reading order inference. In addition, we expand the model's versatility by incorporating diverse data types such as chemical formulas and handwritten Chinese characters into supervised fine-tuning. Finally, to enable rigorous evaluation of our approach, we introduce LogicsParsingBench, a curated set of 1,078 page-level PDF images spanning nine major categories and over twenty sub-categories, which will be released later. Comprehensive experiments conducted on LogicsParsingBench have validated the efficacy and State-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our proposed model across diverse document analysis scenarios.

Existing work has applied VLMs to generate task and motion planning from natural language instructions and simulate training data for robot learning. In this work, we explore using VLM to interpret human demonstration videos and generate robot task planning. Our method integrates keyframe selection, visual perception, and VLM reasoning into a pipeline. We named it SeeDo because it enables the VLM to ''see'' human demonstrations and explain the corresponding plans to the robot for it to ''do''. To validate our approach, we collected a set of long-horizon human videos demonstrating pick-and-place tasks in three diverse categories and designed a set of metrics to comprehensively benchmark SeeDo against several baselines, including state-of-the-art video-input VLMs. The experiments demonstrate SeeDo's superior performance. We further deployed the generated task plans in both a simulation environment and on a real robot arm.</p></details> |  |

Generative motion planners (GMPs) offer advantages over traditional planners, but verifying the safety and dynamic feasibility of their outputs is difficult since neural network verification (NNV) tools scale only to a few hundred neurons, while GMPs often contain millions. To preserve GMP expressiveness while enabling verification, our key insight is to imitate the GMP by stabilizing references sampled from the GMP with a small neural tracking controller and then applying NNV to the closed-loop dynamics. This yields reachable sets that rigorously certify closed-loop safety, while the controller enforces dynamic feasibility. Building on this, we construct a library of verified GMP references and deploy them online in a way that imitates the original GMP distribution whenever it is safe to do so, improving safety without retraining. We evaluate across diverse planners, including diffusion, flow matching, and vision-language models, improving safety in simulation (on ground robots and quadcopters) and on hardware (differential-drive robot).</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |
